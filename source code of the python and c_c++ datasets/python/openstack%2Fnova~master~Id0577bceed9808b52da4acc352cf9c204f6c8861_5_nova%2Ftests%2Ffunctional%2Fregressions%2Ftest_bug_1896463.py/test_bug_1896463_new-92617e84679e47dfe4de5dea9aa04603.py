        # We want to create the following execution scenario:
        # 1) The evacuation makes a move claim on the dest including the PCI
        #    claim. This means there is a migration context. But the evacuation
        #    is not complete yet so the instance.host does not point to the
        #    dest host.
        # 2) The dest resource tracker starts an _update_available_resource()
        #    periodic task and this task loads the list of instances on its
        #    host from the DB. Our instance is not in this list due to #1.
        # 3) The evacuation finishes, the instance.host is set to the dest host
        #    and the migration context is deleted.
        # 4) The periodic task now loads the list of in-progress migration from
        #    the DB to check for incoming our outgoing migrations. However due
        #    to #3 our instance is not in this list either.
        # 5) The periodic task cleans up every lingering PCI claim that is not
        #    connected to any instance collected above from the instance list
        #    and from the migration list. As our instance is not in either of
        #    the lists, the resource tracker  cleans up the PCI allocation for
        #    the already finished evacuation of our instance.
        #
        # Unfortunately we cannot reproduce the above situation without sleeps.

        # finishes, then evac finishes, then periodic finishes. If I trigger
