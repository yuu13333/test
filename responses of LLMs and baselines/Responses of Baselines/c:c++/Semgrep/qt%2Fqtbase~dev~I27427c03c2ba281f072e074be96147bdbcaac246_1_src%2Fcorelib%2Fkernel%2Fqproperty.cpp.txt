          This call to `memset` may be optimized out by the compiler because the buffer is not accessed later
          in the function. This could be an issue if `nd` contains sensitive data, such as passwords or      
          cryptographic keys. Applications should use functions such as `memset_s` or `memset_explicit` to   
          ensure that the sensitive data is cleared.
