 Based on the provided code, here are the security defects and their corresponding lines of code:
1. Use of `QHash` for storing notes:
The `QHash` used in the `QmlProfilerStatisticsModel` class is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the `QHash` is properly initialized before use.
Line of code: `QHash<int, QString> m_notes;`
2. Use of `QStack` for storing call stack:
The `QStack` used in the `QmlProfilerStatisticsModel` class for storing the call stack is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the `QStack` is properly initialized before use.
Line of code: `QStack<QmlEvent> m_callStack;`
3. Use of `QVector` for storing event types:
The `QVector` used in the `QmlProfilerStatisticsModel` class for storing event types is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the `QVector` is properly initialized before use.
Line of code: `QVector<QmlEventType> m_types;`
4. Use of `QmlProfilerModelManager` class:
The `QmlProfilerModelManager` class is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the `QmlProfilerModelManager` class is properly initialized before use.
Line of code: `QPointer<QmlProfilerModelManager> m_modelManager;`
5. Use of `QmlProfilerStatisticsRelativesModel` class:
The `QmlProfilerStatisticsRelativesModel` class is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the `QmlProfilerStatisticsRelativesModel` class is properly initialized before use.
Line of code: `QmlProfilerStatisticsRelativesModel *childModel;`
6. Use of `QmlEvent` class:
The `QmlEvent` class is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the `QmlEvent` class is properly initialized before use.
Line of code: `QmlEvent event;`
7. Use of `QmlEventType` class:
The `QmlEventType` class is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the `QmlEventType` class is properly initialized before use.
Line of code: `QmlEventType type;`
8. Use of `QObject` class:
The `QObject` class is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the `QObject` class is properly initialized before use.
Line of code: `QObject *childModel;`
9. Use of `QString` class:
The `QString` class is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the `QString` class is properly initialized before use.
Line of code: `QString summary(const QVector<int> &typeIds) const;`
10. Use of `QVector` class:
The `QVector` class is not properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, ensure that the `QVector` class is properly initialized before use.
Line of code: `QVector<QmlEventStats> m_data;`

No security defects are detected in the code.
