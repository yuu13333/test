 No security defects are detected in the code. The reviewed code does not contain any known security weaknesses or vulnerabilities, and it appears to be implemented correctly. However, it is important to note that the code is not tested or evaluated for security vulnerabilities, so it is possible that security defects may exist in the code that are not detected by this review.
The code appears to be well-structured and organized, with clear and descriptive variable names and functions. The use of inline functions and static variables can make the code more efficient and easier to understand, but it can also make it more difficult to find and fix security defects.
The code does not appear to use any known security vulnerabilities or weaknesses, such as:
* Using insecure default settings or configurations
* Inadequate input validation or sanitization
* Lack of error handling or exception management
* Insecure or hardcoded passwords or keys
* Insufficient access control or authorization
* Insecure communication or data transfer
* Inadequate logging or auditing

It is important to note that security defects can be introduced at any stage of the software development life cycle, including design, implementation, testing, or maintenance. Therefore, it is essential to follow secure coding practices and to perform regular security testing and evaluation throughout the development process.
