 The code provided does not contain any security defects. The `QHstsPolicy` class appears to be implemented correctly, with proper use of member variables and function calls.
Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:
1. In the constructor, you are initializing the `QUrl` object with an empty host name and subdomains not included. It would be better to initialize the `QUrl` object with a valid host name and subdomains not included, to ensure that the policy is valid and can be used correctly.
2. In the `setHost` function, you are using `QUrl::setHost` with a `QUrl::ParsingMode` of `QUrl::ParsingMode::NoValidation`. It is recommended to use `QUrl::ParsingMode::NormalValidation` instead, to ensure that the host name is validated correctly.
3. In the `setExpiry` function, you are using `QDateTime::currentGetTimeUtc` to determine if the policy is expired. It is recommended to use `QDateTime::currentDateTimeUtc` instead, to ensure that the current date and time are used correctly.
4. In the `includesSubDomains` function, you are using `d->includeSubDomains` directly. It is recommended to use a getter function instead, to ensure that the variable is accessed correctly and the policy is consistent.
5. In the `operator==` function, you are using `*d == *other.d` to compare the policies. It is recommended to use `QHstsPolicyPrivate::operator==` instead, to ensure that the correct comparison is performed.
6. In the `QHstsPolicy` constructor, you are using `new QHstsPolicyPrivate`. It is recommended to use `QHstsPolicyPrivate::QHstsPolicyPrivate` instead, to ensure that the correct constructor is called.
7. In the `QHstsPolicy` destructor, you are using `qSwap(d, other.d)`. It is recommended to use `QHstsPolicyPrivate::swap` instead, to ensure that the correct swap operation is performed.
8. In the `setHost` function, you are using `QUrl::ComponentFormattingOptions` to format the host name. It is recommended to use `QUrl::HostComponentFormattingOptions` instead, to ensure that the correct formatting options are used.
9. In the `host` function, you are using `QUrl::host` to retrieve the host name. It is recommended to use `QHstsPolicyPrivate::url.host` instead, to ensure that the correct host name is retrieved.
10. In the `setExpiry` function, you are using `QDateTime::currentGetTimeUtc` to determine if the policy is expired. It is recommended to use `QDateTime::currentDateTimeUtc` instead, to ensure that the current date and time are used correctly.

No security defects are detected in the code provided. The `QHstsPolicy` class appears to be implemented correctly, with proper use of member variables and function calls. However, there are some minor suggestions for improvement, such as using `QUrl::ParsingMode::NormalValidation` instead of `QUrl::ParsingMode::NoValidation` in the `setHost` function, and using `QUrl::HostComponentFormattingOptions` instead of `QUrl::ComponentFormattingOptions` in the `host` function.
