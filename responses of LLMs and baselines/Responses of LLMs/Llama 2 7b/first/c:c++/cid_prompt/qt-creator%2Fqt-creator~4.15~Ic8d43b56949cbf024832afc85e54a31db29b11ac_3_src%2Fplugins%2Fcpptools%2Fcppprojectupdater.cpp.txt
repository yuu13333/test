 I have reviewed the code provided and did not find any security defects. Here are the results of my analysis:
1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): No vulnerabilities were found. The code uses `QFutureWatcher` and `QFuture` to manage asynchronous operations, which provides proper access control and ensures that the code is thread-safe.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities): No vulnerabilities were found. The code does not interact with multiple entities directly, so this rule does not apply.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime): No vulnerabilities were found. The code properly manages the `ProjectInfo` resource throughout its lifetime, and there are no instances of improper control.
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): No vulnerabilities were found. The code performs calculations correctly, and there are no instances of incorrect calculation.
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): No vulnerabilities were found. The code uses `QFutureWatcher` and `QFuture` to manage asynchronous operations, which provides proper control flow management.
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): No vulnerabilities were found. The code uses `QFutureWatcher` and `QFuture` to manage asynchronous operations, which provides proper protection mechanism failure handling.
7. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): No vulnerabilities were found. The code properly handles exceptions and provides proper checks for exceptional conditions.
8. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): No vulnerabilities were found. The code adheres to the coding standards and does not violate any of them.

In conclusion, the code provided does not contain any security defects according to the security rules I have analyzed.
