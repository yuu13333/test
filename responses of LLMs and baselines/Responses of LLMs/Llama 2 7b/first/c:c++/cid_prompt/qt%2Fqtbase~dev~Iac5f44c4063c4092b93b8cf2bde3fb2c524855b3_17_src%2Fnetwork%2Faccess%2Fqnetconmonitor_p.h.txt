 I have reviewed the code provided, and I did not find any security defects. Here are the reasons why:
1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
The code does not have any instances of improper access control, as it properly enforces access control using the `Q_DECLARE_PRIVATE` and `Q_DISABLE_COPY_MOVE` macros to define private and non-movable classes, respectively. Additionally, the `Q_OBJECT` macro is used to declare the `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` and `QNetworkStatusMonitor` classes, which ensures that they inherit the necessary functionality from `QObject` and implement the necessary virtual functions.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
The code does not have any instances of improper interaction between multiple entities, as it does not use any shared state or communicate with external entities that could potentially cause conflicts. The `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` and `QNetworkStatusMonitor` classes operate independently and do not interact with each other in any way.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
The code does not have any instances of improper control of a resource through its lifetime, as it properly manages the lifetime of the `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` and `QNetworkStatusMonitor` objects using the `QObject` class's destructor and the `QTimer` class's `timerEvent` function. The objects are properly deleted when they go out of scope, and the `QTimer` event is properly handled when the objects are no longer valid.
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
The code does not have any instances of incorrect calculation, as it uses the `QHostAddress` class to perform network-related operations. The `QHostAddress` class provides a set of functions for performing network-related operations, such as resolving hostnames to IP addresses, and the code uses these functions correctly.
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
The code does not have any instances of insufficient control flow management, as it properly uses the `Q_DECLARE_PRIVATE` and `Q_DISABLE_COPY_MOVE` macros to define private and non-movable classes, respectively. Additionally, the `Q_OBJECT` macro is used to declare the `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` and `QNetworkStatusMonitor` classes, which ensures that they inherit the necessary functionality from `QObject` and implement the necessary virtual functions.
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
The code does not have any instances of protection mechanism failure, as it does not use any protection mechanisms that could potentially fail. The code uses the `QObject` class's destructor and the `QTimer` class's `timerEvent` function to manage the lifetime of the `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` and `QNetworkStatusMonitor` objects, and these mechanisms are properly implemented.
7. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
The code does not have any instances of improper check or handling of exceptional conditions, as it does not use any exceptions or error handling mechanisms that could potentially cause problems. The code properly handles the `QObject::timerEvent` function and the `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` and `QNetworkStatusMonitor` objects' destructors, and it does not use any other mechanisms that could potentially cause problems.
8. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
The code adheres to the Qt coding standards, as it uses the `Q_DECLARE_PRIVATE` and `Q_DISABLE_COPY_MOVE` macros to define private and non-movable classes, respectively, and it uses the `Q_OBJECT` macro to declare the `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` and `QNetworkStatusMonitor` classes. Additionally, the code uses the `QTimer` class's `timerEvent` function to handle events, and it properly handles the `QObject::timerEvent` function.

In conclusion, the code provided does not contain any security defects according to the CWE categories I analyzed.
