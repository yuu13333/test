 I have reviewed the code provided, and I did not find any security defects. Here are the line numbers for each component of the code:
1. Copyright and license header: lines 1-5
2. Enums: lines 7-11
3. Structs: lines 12-19
4. Classes: lines 20-43
5. Functions: lines 44-165

No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be well-written, and it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other common security issues. However, it is important to note that security defects can be difficult to detect, and it is always a good idea to thoroughly test and review code to ensure that it is secure.
