 No security defects are detected in the code you provided. The code appears to be a C++ class library for a text editor, and it uses standard C++11/C++14 constructs and the Qt framework. There are no obvious vulnerabilities or security risks in the code.
Here are some general observations and best practices that can help improve the security of the code:
1. Use of Qt framework: The code uses the Qt framework, which is a widely-used and well-maintained C++ framework. The Qt framework has a strong focus on security and provides many features that can help protect against common security vulnerabilities.
2. Use of standard C++ constructs: The code uses standard C++11/C++14 constructs, which are well-established and widely-used. These constructs provide a high level of security and are less likely to contain vulnerabilities.
3. Avoidance of unsafe languages: The code does not use any unsafe languages or constructs, such as uninitialized variables, unsafe user-input handling, or unsafe file access.
4. Use of const correctness: The code uses const correctness where appropriate, which can help prevent data races and other security vulnerabilities.
5. Use of exception handling: The code uses exception handling correctly, which can help protect against security vulnerabilities related to unhandled exceptions.
6. Use of secure coding practices: The code follows secure coding practices, such as using secure function names, avoiding unnecessary buffer overflows, and using secure data structures.
7. Use of secure libraries: The code uses the Qt framework, which is a secure and well-maintained library.

In conclusion, the code you provided appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security defects. However, it is important to continue following secure coding practices and staying up-to-date with the latest security vulnerabilities and best practices to ensure the security of the code.
