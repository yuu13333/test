 After analyzing the code provided in the commit message, I did not find any obvious security defects. Here is a detailed analysis of the code:
1. Use of `std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource` - The code uses `std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource` to create a buffer for storing the set of unique values. This is a safe choice, as `std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource` is a type-safe and secure buffer class that provides a way to create a buffer that is guaranteed to be monotonic and non-overlapping.
2. Use of `QHash` - The code uses `QHash` to implement the set data structure. `QHash` is a safe and secure hash table class that provides a way to store key-value pairs in a hash table. The code does not use any unsafe or dangerous operations with `QHash`, so no security defects are detected.
3. Use of `QSet` - The code uses `QSet` to implement the set data structure. `QSet` is a safe and secure set class that provides a way to store a collection of unique values. The code does not use any unsafe or dangerous operations with `QSet`, so no security defects are detected.
4. Use of `QDuplicateTracker` - The code uses `QDuplicateTracker` to implement the duplicate value tracker. `QDuplicateTracker` is a safe and secure class that provides a way to track duplicate values in a collection. The code does not use any unsafe or dangerous operations with `QDuplicateTracker`, so no security defects are detected.
5. Use of `std::move` - The code uses `std::move` to move the set of unique values into the `QDuplicateTracker` class. `std::move` is a safe and secure function that provides a way to move an object from one location to another. The code does not use any unsafe or dangerous operations with `std::move`, so no security defects are detected.

Based on the analysis, no security defects are detected in the code. The code uses safe and secure classes and functions, and does not perform any dangerous or unsafe operations. Therefore, the code is safe and secure.
