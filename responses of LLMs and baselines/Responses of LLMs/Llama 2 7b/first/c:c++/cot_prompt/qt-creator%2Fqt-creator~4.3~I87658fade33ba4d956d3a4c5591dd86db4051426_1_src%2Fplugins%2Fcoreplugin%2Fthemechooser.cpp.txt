 Based on the provided code, I have analyzed it for security defects and found a potential issue.
Security Defect: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
The `ThemeEntry` class has a `displayName()` method that retrieves the display name of the theme entry. However, this method uses the `id()` method of the `ThemeEntry` class to retrieve the ID of the theme entry, which could potentially lead to an IDOR vulnerability.
The reason for this is that the `id()` method is not validated to ensure that the ID passed to it is a valid ID for the theme entry. An attacker could potentially pass a malicious ID to the `id()` method, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the theme entry.
Corresponding Line Number of Code: 20
Solution: To fix this vulnerability, the `id()` method should be validated to ensure that the ID passed to it is a valid
