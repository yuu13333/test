 After analyzing the generated code files, I did not find any security defects in the original code. The code appears to be free of any security vulnerabilities, and it is well-structured and well-written.
Here are some observations and insights into the code:
1. The code uses the `QShortcut` class to represent shortcuts in the `QShortcutMap`. This class is part of the Qt framework and is designed to handle keyboard shortcuts. Using this class helps to ensure that the code is consistent with the Qt framework's security practices.
2. The code uses the `QTest::sendKeyEvent` function to send keyboard shortcuts to the target window. This function is part of the Qt testing framework and is designed to send keyboard events to a window. Using this function helps to ensure that the code is portable and works as expected across different platforms and environments.
3. The code uses the `QObject::deleteLater` function to delete objects that are no longer needed. This function is part of the Qt framework and is designed to release resources when an object is no longer needed. Using this function helps to ensure that the code is efficient and does not leak resources.
4. The code uses the `QVERIFY` macro to check whether a function call was successful. This macro is part of the Qt testing framework and is designed to provide a convenient way to check whether a function call was successful. Using this macro helps to ensure that the code is reliable and consistent.

Based on the above analysis, I can confidently say that there are no security defects in the original code. The code is well-written, and it appears to be free of any security vulnerabilities.
