 I analyzed the code provided in the commit message, and I did not find any security defects. Here are the details of my analysis:
1. Injection vulnerabilities:
The code does not use any user-input validation or sanitization mechanisms, which could make it vulnerable to injection attacks. However, since the code only deals with HSTS policy settings and does not handle user input directly, the risk of injection vulnerabilities is low. Therefore, I consider this code to be relatively secure in this regard.
2. Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:
The code does not use any protection against XSS attacks, such as input validation or encoding. However, since the code only deals with HSTS policy settings and does not handle user input directly, the risk of XSS vulnerabilities is low. Therefore, I consider this code to be relatively secure in this regard.
3. Information disclosure vulnerabilities:
The code does not disclose any sensitive information, and it does not handle any user data that could be sensitive. Therefore, I consider this code to be secure in this regard.
4. Broken access control vulnerabilities:
The code does not use any access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data or actions. However, since the code only deals with HSTS policy settings and does not handle sensitive data, the risk of broken access control vulnerabilities is low. Therefore, I consider this code to be relatively secure in this regard.

Based on my analysis, I can confidently state that no security defects are detected in the code provided in the commit message. However, it is important to note that security defects can be introduced at any time during the development process, so it is crucial to continue monitoring the code for security vulnerabilities and addressing them promptly.
