 I have reviewed the code provided, and I did not find any security defects. The code appears to be well-written and follows good coding practices.
Here are some observations and suggestions:
1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both lowercase and uppercase letters for variable names, which is a common convention in C++. However, it is important to be consistent throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand. Consider using a consistent naming convention throughout the code.
2. Comments:
The code has some comments, but they could be improved. It is important to provide clear and concise comments to explain what the code is doing, especially for complex functions or classes. Consider adding more comments to the code to make it easier to understand.
3. Error handling:
The code does not handle any errors or exceptions, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Consider adding error handling mechanisms to the code to handle any unexpected inputs or conditions.
4. Code organization:
The code is organized into several classes and functions, which is a good practice. However, consider organizing the code into separate modules or packages to make it easier to maintain and reuse.
5. Code style:
The code has some inconsistencies in indentation and spacing, which can make it harder to read and understand. Consider using a consistent indentation and spacing style throughout the code to make it easier to read.

No security defects are detected in the code.
