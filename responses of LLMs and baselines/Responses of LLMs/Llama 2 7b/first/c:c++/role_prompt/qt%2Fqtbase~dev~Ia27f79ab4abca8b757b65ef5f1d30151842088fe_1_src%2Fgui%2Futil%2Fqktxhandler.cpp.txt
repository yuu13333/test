 Great, thank you for providing the code! After a thorough review, I found no security defects or vulnerabilities in the provided code. The code appears to be well-structured, and the functions are clearly defined.
However, I did notice a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:
1. In a few places, the code uses `qCDebug()` instead of `QDebug()`. While `qCDebug()` is a valid function, it's not part of the Qt API
