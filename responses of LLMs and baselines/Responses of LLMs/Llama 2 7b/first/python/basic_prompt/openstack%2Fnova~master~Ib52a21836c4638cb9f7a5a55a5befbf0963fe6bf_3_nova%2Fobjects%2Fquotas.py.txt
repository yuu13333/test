 No security defects are detected in the code.
The code appears to be implementing a quota management system for a compute service, with methods for checking quota limits, committing and rolling back reservations, and creating and updating limits. The code uses the `db` module for interacting with the database, and the `base` module for remoting.
The code does not use any insecure language constructs, such as:
* SQL injection vulnerabilities (e.g. using unescaped user input in SQL queries)
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (e.g. using unescaped user input in HTML output)
* Command injection vulnerabilities (e.g. using unescaped user input in shell commands)
* Information disclosure vulnerabilities (e.g. leaking sensitive information in response to an HTTP request)

Therefore, the code is relatively secure and does not appear to contain any significant security defects. However, as with any codebase, it is important to continue monitoring and reviewing the code for potential security vulnerabilities, especially as the codebase evolves and grows over time.
