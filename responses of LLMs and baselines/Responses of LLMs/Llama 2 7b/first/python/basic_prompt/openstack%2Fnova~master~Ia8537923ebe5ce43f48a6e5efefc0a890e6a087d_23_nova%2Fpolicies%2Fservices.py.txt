 No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be a Python module that defines a set of policy rules for the OpenStack Compute service. The rules are defined using the `policy.DocumentedRuleDefault` class from the `oslo_policy` library, which is a popular library for defining and managing security policies in OpenStack.
The code defines a set of policy rules for listing, updating, and deleting Compute services. The rules are defined using the `check_str` parameter of the `policy.DocumentedRuleDefault` class, which specifies the identity of the user or group that must be authenticated in order to perform the operation. The `scope_types` parameter specifies the scope of the policy, which in this case is limited to the `system` scope.
The code also includes a `deprecated_since` parameter for each rule, which indicates the version of OpenStack at which the rule was introduced and will be removed. This is a common pattern in OpenStack policy definitions, as new features and improvements are introduced in each release.
Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for defining security policies in OpenStack.
