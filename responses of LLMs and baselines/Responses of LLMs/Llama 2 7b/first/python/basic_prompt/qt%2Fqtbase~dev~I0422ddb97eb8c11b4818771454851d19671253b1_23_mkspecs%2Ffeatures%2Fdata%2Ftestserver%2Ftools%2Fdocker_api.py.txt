 No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be a Python script that uses the `docker` command-line tool to interact with Docker containers. The script defines several functions that perform various Docker-related tasks, such as building and running Docker containers, removing containers and images, and retrieving the Docker version.
The code appears to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, there are a few potential security-related issues that could be addressed:
1. Using `check_output()` to retrieve the Docker version: The `check_output()` function can be vulnerable to shell injection attacks if the output of the `docker` command is not properly sanitized. It's recommended to use the `check_call()` function instead, which will execute the command and return its output as a string, but will not execute any shell commands.
2. Using `Popen()` to run Docker commands: The `Popen()` function can be vulnerable to command injection attacks if the command being executed contains user-supplied data. It's recommended to use the `subprocess.check_call()` function instead, which will execute the command and return its output as a string, but will not execute any shell commands.
3. Using `docker_file` and `docker_run()` functions: These functions use the `docker build` and `docker run` commands to interact with Docker containers. However, these commands can be vulnerable to command injection attacks if the container's Dockerfile contains user-supplied data. It's recommended to use the `DockerConfig` class to define the container's configuration and pass it to the `docker_run()` function, rather than hardcoding the Dockerfile contents directly in the function.
4. Using `docker_rm()` and `docker_rmi()` functions: These functions use the `docker rm` and `docker rmi` commands to remove Docker containers and images. However, these commands can be vulnerable to command injection attacks if the container or image names contain user-supplied data. It's recommended to use the `DockerConfig` class to define the container or image names and pass them to the `docker_rm()` or `docker_rmi()` functions, rather than hardcoding the names directly in the functions.
5. Using `script` variable in `docker_exec()` function: The `script` variable contains the path to a Python script that is executed in the container. However, if this script contains user-supplied data, it could be vulnerable to code injection attacks. It's recommended to sanitize the `script` variable contents before using them.

In summary, while the code appears to be well-written, there are a few potential security-related issues that could be addressed to ensure the code is more secure.
