 No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, I did notice a few things that could potentially be improved:
1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
In the code, there are instances of both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's best to stick to a consistent convention throughout the code.
2. Unused variables:
In line 13, the `mock_get` variable is defined but not used anywhere in the code. It's best to remove unused variables to avoid confusion and make the code more readable.
3. Fixture usage:
In line 33, the `useFixture` method is used to define a mock patch. However, the fixture is not used anywhere in the code. It's best to remove unused fixtures to avoid confusion and make the code more readable.
4. Policy check inconsistencies:
In line 51, the `self.common_policy_check` method is called with a list of authorized and unauthorized contexts. However, the method signature suggests that it should take a single list of contexts as an argument. It's best to modify the method signature to match the expected argument format.
5. Missing docstrings:
In lines 6, 24, and 59, there are no docstrings provided for the `setUp` method. It's best to include docstrings for all methods to provide context and make the code more readable.
6. Unused import:
In line 14, the `mock` import is not used anywhere in the code. It's best to remove unused imports to avoid confusion and make the code more readable.

In conclusion, the code appears to be well-written and follows good coding practices. However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved to make the code more readable and maintainable.
