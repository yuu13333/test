 No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be following best practices for secure coding, such as:
1. Using the `oslo_config` module to import configuration settings.
2. Using the `oslo_log` module to log messages.
3. Importing the `six` module to use its functions for working with Python 2 and Python 3.
4. Using the `struct` module to perform binary data operations.
5. Using the `six.text_type` function to convert Python strings to bytes.
6. Using the `six.int2byte` function to convert Python integers to bytes.
7. Using the `auth.AuthType` enumeration to define security types.
8. Using the `auth.AUTH_STATUS_PASS` and `auth.AUTH_STATUS_FAIL` constants to define the security status of the negotiation.
9. Using the `exception.RFBAuthNoAvailableScheme` exception to handle the case where no security schemes are available.
10. Using the `exception.SecurityProxyNegotiationFailed` exception to handle the case where security negotiation fails.

Please note that this review only covers the security aspects of the code and does not include a general review of the codebase.
