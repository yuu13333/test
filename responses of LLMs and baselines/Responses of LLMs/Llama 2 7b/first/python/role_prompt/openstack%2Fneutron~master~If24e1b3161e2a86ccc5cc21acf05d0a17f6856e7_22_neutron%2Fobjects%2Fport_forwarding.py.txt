 I have reviewed the provided code for security defects, and I found none. The code appears to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. Here are some observations and suggestions for improvements:
1. Code organization: The code is well-organized, with clear separation of concerns between different classes and functions. However, some of the functions have long names, which could make them harder to understand quickly. Consider breaking down longer functions into smaller, more focused functions.
2. Variable names: Some of the variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `FIELDS_NOT_SUPPORT_FILTER` could be renamed to `ignored_fields`, and ` foreign_keys` could be renamed to `foreign_key_fields`.
3. Type hints: The code uses type hints for function parameters, which is a good practice. However, consider adding type hints for class attributes as well, to make the code more readable and maintainable.
4. Code style: The code uses consistent indentation and spacing, which makes it easy to read. However, consider using a consistent coding style throughout the codebase. For example, use consistent spacing between function arguments and the `def` keyword, and use consistent indentation for block comments.
5. Security considerations: The code does not appear to have any direct security vulnerabilities. However, consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and error handling, to prevent potential security issues.
6. Testing: The code does not appear to have any comprehensive testing coverage. Consider adding unit tests for all important functions and classes, to ensure that the code works correctly and is secure.
7. Documentation: The code does not have extensive documentation, which can make it harder for other developers to understand and maintain. Consider adding comments and docstrings to explain the purpose and usage of each class and function.
8. Code reuse: The code appears to be duplicated in several places, which can make it harder to maintain and update. Consider refactoring the code to reuse functionality and reduce duplication.

In conclusion, the code appears to be well-written and secure, but there are some areas where improvements can be made. By following best practices and addressing these issues, the code can be further improved to make it more maintainable, readable, and secure.
