27. `super(MonitorDaemon, self).handle_sigterm(signum, frame)`: This line calls the `handle_sigterm` method for the parent class, `daemon.Daemon`.
28. `if event.name == self.interface and event.cidr == self.cidr:`: This line checks if the `event` object has the same `name` and `cidr` as the `interface` and `cidr` instance variables for the `MonitorDaemon` class.
29. `new_state = 'master' if event.event == 'added' else 'backup'`: This line checks the type of event (`added` or `removed`) and sets the `new_state` instance variable accordingly.
30. `self.write_state_change(new_state)`: This line writes the new state to a file.
31. `self.notify_agent(new_state)`: This line notifies the agent of the new state.

No security defects were found in the code provided. The code appears to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, I did notice a few potential issues:
1. Insecure logging: The code uses `log.debug()` to log messages, which can potentially expose sensitive information if not properly configured. It is recommended to use secure logging mechanisms, such as SSL/TLS encryption, to protect sensitive information.
2. Insecure configuration: The code uses `config.setup_logging()` to configure logging, which can potentially expose sensitive information if not properly configured. It is recommended to use secure configuration mechanisms, such as environment variables or configuration files, to protect sensitive information.
3. Insecure communication: The code uses `httplib2` to communicate with the agent, which can potentially expose sensitive information if not properly secured. It is recommended to use secure communication mechanisms, such as SSL/TLS encryption, to protect sensitive information.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and does not contain any obvious security defects. However, it is important to follow best practices for
