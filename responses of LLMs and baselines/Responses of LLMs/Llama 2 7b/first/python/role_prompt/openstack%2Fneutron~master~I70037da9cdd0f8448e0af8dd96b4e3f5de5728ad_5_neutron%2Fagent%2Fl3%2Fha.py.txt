 No security defects were found in the code. However, there are a few minor issues and suggestions that could be addressed:
1. Missing docstrings: Some functions and classes lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's important to include docstrings to make the code more readable and maintainable.
2. Unused variables and functions: There are some variables and functions that are not used anywhere in the code. It's best to remove them or use them to avoid unnecessary complexity.
3. Magic numbers: Some constants are defined without explanations or justifications. It's better to use descriptive names or constants to make the code more readable and maintainable.
4. Unnecessary complexity: Some parts of the code have unnecessary complexity, such as using `try...except` blocks multiple times in a row. It's better to simplify the code and use more efficient techniques to handle errors.
5. Lack of exception handling: Some parts of the code lack proper exception handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. It's important to handle exceptions properly to ensure that the code is robust and reliable.
6. Use of deprecated functions: Some functions are deprecated and should be avoided. It's better to use the latest and most efficient functions to avoid compatibility issues and errors.
7. Missing type hints: Some functions and variables lack type hints, which can make the code less readable and maintainable. It's important to include type hints to make the code more readable and maintainable.
8. Unused import: There is an unused import statement in the code, which can be removed to simplify the code and reduce errors.

Overall, the code appears to be
