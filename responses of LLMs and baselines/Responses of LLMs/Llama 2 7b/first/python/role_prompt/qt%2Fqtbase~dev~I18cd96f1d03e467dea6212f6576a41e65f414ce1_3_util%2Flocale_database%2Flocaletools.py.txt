 I have carefully reviewed the code provided, and I did not find any security defects. Here are some observations and suggestions:
1. The code appears to be well-organized and follows a logical structure, making it easy to understand and navigate.
2. The use of meaningful variable names and comments throughout the code makes it easier to understand the code's purpose and functionality.
3. The code uses type hints for function parameters and return types, which can help catch type-related errors at runtime.
4. The code does not use any vulnerable libraries or dependencies that are known to have security vulnerabilities.
5. The code does not perform any file operations that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, such as reading or writing to sensitive files.
6. The code does not use any dangerous language features, such as untrusted user input, that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
7. The code does not perform any cryptographic operations that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, such as decrypting sensitive data without proper authorization.
8. The code does not use any third-party libraries that could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities.
9. The code does not perform any network operations that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, such as connecting to untrusted networks or sending sensitive data over the network.
10. The code does not use any obsolete or deprecated functionality that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

Based on the code review, I can confidently state that there are no security defects in the code provided. However, it is essential to keep in mind that security is an ongoing process, and new security vulnerabilities may arise as the codebase evolves. Therefore, it is crucial to continue monitoring the codebase for security vulnerabilities and addressing any issues that arise.
