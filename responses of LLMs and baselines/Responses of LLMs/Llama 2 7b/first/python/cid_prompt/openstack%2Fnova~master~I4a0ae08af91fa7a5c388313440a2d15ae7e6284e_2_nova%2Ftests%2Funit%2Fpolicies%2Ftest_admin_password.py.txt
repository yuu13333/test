 I have reviewed the code provided and did not find any security defects. Here are some potential security defects and their corresponding lines of code:
1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
* The `admin_authorized_contexts` and `admin_unauthorized_contexts` lists are not properly defined. They should be defined as sets of tuples, where each tuple contains the context and the permissions that the user has in that context. For example: `admin_authorized_contexts = {('legacy_admin_context', 'admin'), ('system_admin_context', 'admin'), ('project_admin_context', 'admin'), ('project_member_context', 'admin'), ('project_reader_context', 'read'), ('project_foo_context', 'read')}`.
* The `common_policy_check` function is not properly checking the permissions of the user. It should check the permissions of the user in each context, rather than just checking if the user is in a particular context.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
* The `change_password` API endpoint does not properly handle multiple instances of the same user. It should check if the user has multiple instances and handle them appropriately.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
* The `change_password` API endpoint does not properly handle the lifetime of the password. It should check if the password is valid and if it has been changed recently.
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
* The `change_password` API endpoint does not properly calculate the password hash. It should use a secure hash function and salt to ensure the password is properly hashed.
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
* The `common_policy_check` function is not properly handling the flow of execution. It should check the permissions of the user in each context and handle the flow of execution accordingly.
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
* The `change_password` API endpoint does not properly handle the case where the password protection mechanism fails. It should check if the password is valid and if it has been changed recently, even if the protection mechanism fails.
7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
* The `common_policy_check` function is not properly comparing the permissions of the user. It should compare the permissions of the user in each context, rather than just comparing the user's role.
8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
* The `common_policy_check` function is not properly handling exceptional conditions. It should check if the user has the necessary permissions and handle the exception if the user does not have the necessary permissions.

Based on the code provided, no security defects are detected. However, it is important to note that this code is just a starting point and should be thoroughly reviewed and tested to ensure that it is secure and functions as intended.
