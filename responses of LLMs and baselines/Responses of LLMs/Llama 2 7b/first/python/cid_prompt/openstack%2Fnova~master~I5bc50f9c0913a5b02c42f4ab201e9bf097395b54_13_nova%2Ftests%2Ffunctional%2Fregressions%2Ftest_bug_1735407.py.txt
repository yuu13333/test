The code appears to be properly structured and follows good coding practices. However, there are a few potential issues that could be improved upon:
1. Missing docstrings: Some functions and classes lack docstrings, which can make it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It is recommended to add docstrings to all functions and classes to improve code readability.
2. Lack of exception handling: Some places in the code lack proper exception handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior in case of errors. It is recommended to add try-except blocks to handle all possible exceptions and propagate them to a central location for handling.
3. Use of `time.sleep()`: The code uses `time.sleep()` to simulate delays in the rebuild process. While this is a common technique, it can lead to performance issues if not used properly. It is recommended to use more efficient techniques, such as using a thread pool or using a scheduler, to handle concurrent tasks.
4. Use of `fake.restore_nodes()`: The code uses `fake.restore_nodes()` to restore the node list after mocking the API. While this is a convenient technique, it can lead to unexpected behavior if not used properly. It is recommended to use more explicit techniques, such as using a separate module or function, to manage the node list and ensure that it is properly restored.
5. Lack of test coverage: The code appears to have limited test coverage, which can make it difficult to ensure that the code is functioning properly. It is recommended to add more test cases to cover all possible scenarios and edge cases to improve code quality.

In summary, while the code appears to be properly structured and follows good coding practices, there are a few potential issues that could be improved upon. By addressing these issues, the code can be made more robust, efficient, and secure.
