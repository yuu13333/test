 Based on the code provided, here are some potential security defects and their corresponding lines of code:
1. CWE-284 - Improper Access Control:
Line 154: `docker_file = '\n'.join(base_file + config.docker_file)`
Reason: The `docker_file` variable is constructed by concatenating the `base_file` and `config.docker_file` strings without any proper access control. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the `docker_file` by manipulating the `config.docker_file` variable.
2. CWE-435 - Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities:
Line 163: `docker_pipe = Popen(('docker build - --quiet -t %s' % config.image_name).split(),`
Reason: The `docker_build` function calls `docker build` with the `- --quiet -t` options, which can lead to unexpected behavior if multiple containers are being built simultaneously. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to interfere with the build process.
3. CWE-664 - Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime:
Line 173: `docker_file = '\n'.join(base_file + config.docker_file)`
Reason: The `docker_file` variable is created and modified multiple times throughout the code without proper resource management. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the `docker_file` contents and affect the build process.
4. CWE-682 - Incorrect Calculation:
Line 183: `retry = 60`
Reason: The `retry` variable is set to a fixed value of 60 without proper calculation. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause the script to hang indefinitely.
5. CWE-703 - Protection Mechanism Failure:
Line 219: `docker_pipe.communicate()`
Reason: The `docker_pipe.communicate()` method is called without proper error handling. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause the script to fail with an unexpected error message.
6. CWE-707 - Incorrect Comparison:
Line 220: `docker_pipe.communicate()`
Reason: The `docker_pipe.communicate()` method is called with an empty string as the `stdin` parameter. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause the script to fail with an unexpected error message.
7. CWE-710 - Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions:
Line 221: `docker_pipe.communicate()`
Reason: The `docker_pipe.communicate()` method is called without proper exception handling. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause the script to fail with an unexpected error message.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the following changes can be made:
1. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Validate user input and sanitize it to prevent code injection attacks.
3. Use secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS, to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
4. Implement proper access control mechanisms, such as authentication and authorization, to restrict access to sensitive resources.
5. Use secure coding practices, such as input validation and error handling, to prevent unexpected behavior.
6. Implement proper exception handling to prevent unexpected errors from occurring.
7. Use secure data storage mechanisms, such as encryption, to protect against
