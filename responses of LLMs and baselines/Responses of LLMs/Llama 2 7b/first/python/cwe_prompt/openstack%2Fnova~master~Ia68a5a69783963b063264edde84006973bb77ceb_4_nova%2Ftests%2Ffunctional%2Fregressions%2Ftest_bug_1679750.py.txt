40. `41         """Tests that allocations are removed after a local delete.
42         This tests the scenario where a server is local deleted (because the
43         compute host is down) and we want to make sure that its allocations
44         have been cleaned up.
45         """`: This line provides a brief description of the test method.
46. `46         # Get allocations, make sure they are 0.`: This line begins the test method.
47. `47         resp = self.placement_api.get('/resource_providers')`: This line retrieves the list of resource providers from the `placement_api`.

55. `56         server = self.admin_api.post_server({'server': server})`: This line creates a new server using the `admin_api`.
56. `57         server = self._wait_for_state_change(self.api, server, 'ACTIVE')`: This line waits for the server to reach the `ACTIVE` state.
57. `58 
59         # Assert usages are non zero now.`: This line begins the test of the usage information after the local delete.
60. `61         usages_during = self._get_usages(rp_uuid)`: This line retrieves the usage information for the specified resource provider after the local delete.
61. `62 
63         # They should match.`: This line begins the test that the usage information after the local delete should match the usage information before the local delete.
64. `65         self.assertEqual(usages_before, usages_during)`: This line compares the usage information before and after the local delete to ensure they match.


In conclusion, the code does not contain any security defects according to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. The code uses appropriate security measures such as licensing, testing, and usage of security-related modules to ensure the security of the code.
