 No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be following secure coding practices and adhering to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards.
The code does not contain any known security vulnerabilities or weaknesses, such as:
1. SQL Injection (CWE-89): The code does not use any SQL queries or database operations, so this vulnerability is not present.
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-75): The code does not use any user-provided data in any context, so this vulnerability is not present.
3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-76): The code does not use any user-provided data in any context, so this vulnerability is not present.
4. File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (CWE-476): The code does not use any file inclusions, so this vulnerability is not present.
5. Command Injection (CWE-88): The code does not use any user-provided data in any command, so this vulnerability is not present.
6. Information Leakage (CWE-200): The code does not leak any sensitive information, such as database credentials or API keys, so this vulnerability is not present.
7. Buffer Overflow (CWE-122): The code does not use any user-provided data in any buffer, so this vulnerability is not present.
8. Integer Overflow (CWE-191): The code does not use any integer arithmetic operations, so this vulnerability is not present.
9. Format String Vulnerabilities (CWE-102): The code does not use any format string operations, so this vulnerability is not present.
10. Remote Code Execution (CWE-77): The code does not execute any remote code, so this vulnerability is not present.

It is important to note that this review is based on the provided code snippet only, and it may not be comprehensive or accurate for the entire codebase. Additionally, security defects may be present in the code that are not detected by this review, such as vulnerabilities related to authentication, authorization, or secure communication protocols.
