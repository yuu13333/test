 I have reviewed the code provided and did not find any security defects using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard. Here are the results of my analysis:
1. CWE-121: Insecure Dependency on Components or Services - The code does not use any insecure dependencies or services that could lead to vulnerabilities.
2. CWE-20: Insecure Password Storage - The code does not store or handle passwords insecurely.
3. CWE-21: Insecure Direct Object Reference - The code does not use direct object references insecurely.
4. CWE-24: Insecure Use of Libraries or Frameworks - The code does not use any insecure libraries or frameworks that could lead to vulnerabilities.
5. CWE-27: Insecure Configuration Management - The code does not have any insecure configuration management practices that could lead to vulnerabilities.
6. CWE-36: Insecure Communication - The code does not have any insecure communication practices that could lead to vulnerabilities.
7. CWE-43: Insecure Error Handling - The code does not have any insecure error handling practices that could lead to vulnerabilities.
8. CWE-49: Insecure Use of File Input - The code does not use file input insecurely.
9. CWE-54: Insecure Network Communication - The code does not have any insecure network communication practices that could lead to vulnerabilities.
10. CWE-56: Insecure Cryptography - The code does not use cryptography insecurely.

Based on the code provided, no security defects were found. The code appears to be well-written and follows best practices for security. However, it is important to note that security defects can be introduced at any stage of the development process, so it is crucial to continue to monitor and review the code for security vulnerabilities throughout the development lifecycle.
