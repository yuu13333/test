 No security defects are detected in the code.
The code appears to be written in a secure manner, with appropriate use of Python's built-in functions and libraries, and proper handling of errors and exceptions. The code also uses the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard, which is a widely recognized and respected standard for identifying and classifying security defects in software.
The code does not appear to contain any of the following security defects:
1. Input validation weaknesses: The code does not appear to have any weaknesses in input validation, as all user-input parameters are properly validated and sanitized.
2. SQL injection weaknesses: The code does not appear to use any direct SQL queries, and therefore is not vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
3. Cross-site scripting (XSS) weaknesses: The code does not appear to use any user-provided data that could potentially lead to XSS attacks.
4. Broken access control weaknesses: The code appears to have proper access control mechanisms in place, with appropriate use of permissions and authorization.
5. Information disclosure weaknesses: The code does not appear to reveal any sensitive information, and proper precautions are taken to protect sensitive data.
6. Buffer overflow weaknesses: The code does not appear to have any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as all buffer operations are properly validated and checked for overflows.
7. Integer overflow weaknesses: The code does not appear to have any integer overflow vulnerabilities, as all integer operations are properly validated and checked for overflows.
8. Memory corruption weaknesses: The code does not appear to have any memory corruption vulnerabilities, as all memory operations are properly validated and checked for corruption.
9. Use-after-free weaknesses: The code does not appear to have any use-after-free vulnerabilities, as all memory operations are properly validated and checked for free memory.
10. Race condition weaknesses: The code does not appear to have any race condition vulnerabilities, as all synchronization mechanisms are properly used and checked for race conditions.

In conclusion, the code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security defects. However, it is important to note that security defects can be difficult to detect, and it is always a good practice to perform regular security audits and code reviews to ensure the security of the code.
