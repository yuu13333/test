 I have reviewed the provided code for security defects using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard. Unfortunately, I did not find any security defects in the code.
Here is the code with the corresponding CWE IDs and descriptions:
* No security defects were found in the code.
It's important to note that this review only covers the security aspects of the code and does not take into account other quality aspects such as performance, maintainability, or usability. Additionally, the code may be vulnerable to other security threats not listed in the CWE. Therefore, it's essential to continue monitoring and testing the code for potential security issues and to implement security best practices throughout the development process.
