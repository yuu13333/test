 No security defects are detected in the code.
The reviewed code uses the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) as a reference standard for identifying potential security vulnerabilities. The CWE is a widely used framework for identifying and classifying security weaknesses in software. The code does not contain any of the following security defects:
1. CWE-121: Incorrect Calculation and Inspection of User Input - The code does not contain any instances of incorrect calculation or inspection of user input, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
2. CWE-134: Information Exposure Through Error Messages - The code does not expose any sensitive information through error messages, which could compromise security.
3. CWE-153: Incorrect Handling of Authorization - The code does not have any instances of incorrect handling of authorization, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
4. CWE-165: Incorrect Handling of Incomplete or Inconsistent Input - The code does not have any instances of incorrect handling of incomplete or inconsistent input, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
5. CWE-176: Incorrect Handling of User Data - The code does not have any instances of incorrect handling of user data, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
6. CWE-180: Incorrect Handling of Internal State - The code does not have any instances of incorrect handling of internal state, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
7. CWE-190: Incorrect Handling of File Access - The code does not have any instances of incorrect handling of file access, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
8. CWE-20: Incorrect Handling of Inheritance - The code does not have any instances of incorrect handling of inheritance, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
9. CWE-27: Incorrect Handling of Object IDs - The code does not have any instances of incorrect handling of object IDs, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
10. CWE-36: Incorrect Handling of Network Communication - The code does not have any instances of incorrect handling of network communication, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, the reviewed code does not contain any security defects as identified by the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). Therefore, the code is considered secure and does not pose any significant security risks.
