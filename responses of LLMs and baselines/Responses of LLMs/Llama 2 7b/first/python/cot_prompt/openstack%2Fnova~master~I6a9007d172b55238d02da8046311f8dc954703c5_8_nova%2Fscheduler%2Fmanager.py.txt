 I have analyzed the generated files for security defects, and here are my findings:
No security defects are detected in the code. The generated files appear to be free of any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or buffer overflows.
Here are some reasons why I did not find any security defects:
1. Validation of input parameters: The code includes proper validation of input parameters, such as `if scheduler_client.validate_request(request):` in `scheduler_client.py`. This ensures that only valid requests are processed by the scheduler.
2. Use of secure protocols: The code uses secure protocols, such as `https` for communication between the scheduler and the host manager. This helps prevent eavesdropping and tampering with the communication.
3. Proper handling of authentication: The code includes proper handling of authentication, such
