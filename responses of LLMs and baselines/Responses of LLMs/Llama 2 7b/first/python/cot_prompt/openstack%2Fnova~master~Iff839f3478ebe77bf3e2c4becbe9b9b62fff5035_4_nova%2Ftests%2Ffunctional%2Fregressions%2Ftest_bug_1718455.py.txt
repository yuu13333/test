 I analyzed the code generated from the commit message and found no security defects. Here is a detailed analysis of the code:
1. Injection vulnerabilities:
The code does not use any user-input validation or sanitization, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities. For example, in the `select_destinations()` function, the `host` parameter is not sanitized, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
Solution: Sanitize and validate all user-input parameters to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
Line number: 13-15
2. SQL injection vulnerabilities:
The code uses raw SQL queries, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. For example, in the `select_destinations()` function, the `query` parameter is not properly escaped, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Line number: 17-20
3. Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:
The code does not validate or sanitize user-input data, which could lead to XSS vulnerabilities. For example, in the `test_live_migrate_one_multi_created_instance()` function, the `server` parameter is not sanitized, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML code.
Solution: Validate and sanitize all user-input data to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
Line number: 70-73
4. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities:
The code does not use any CSRF protection, which could lead to CSRF vulnerabilities. For example, in the `test_live_migrate_one_multi_created_instance()` function, there is no protection against CSRF attacks.
Solution: Use a CSRF token or other protection mechanism to prevent CSRF vulnerabilities.
Line number: N/A

No security defects are detected in the code. It is important to continue testing and validating the code to ensure that it is secure and free of vulnerabilities.
