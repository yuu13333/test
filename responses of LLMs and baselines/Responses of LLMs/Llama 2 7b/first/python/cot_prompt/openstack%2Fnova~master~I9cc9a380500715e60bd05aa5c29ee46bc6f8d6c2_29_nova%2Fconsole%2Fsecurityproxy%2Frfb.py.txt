 Based on the provided code, I have analyzed it for security defects, and here are my findings:
No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for secure coding. Here are some observations that could help improve the code's security:
1. Input validation: The code does not perform any input validation for the `version` parameter passed to the `connect` method. It is essential to validate all user-supplied input to prevent SQL injection attacks. Adding proper input validation mechanisms, such as using the `param` decorator from Django's `django.core.validators` module, can help mitigate this risk.
2. SQL injection: The code uses raw SQL queries, which can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. To prevent this, consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool like Django's `django.db.models` module, which can help protect against SQL injection attacks by escaping user-supplied input.
3. Authentication bypass: The code does not implement any security measures to prevent authentication bypass attacks. Consider implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as using Django's built-in authentication and authorization systems, to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
4. Error handling: The code does not handle errors properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Ensure that all exceptions are caught and handled appropriately, and consider using a logging mechanism to track and monitor errors.
5. Security best practices: The code does not follow security best practices, such as using secure coding practices, input validation, and error handling. Consider reviewing and implementing security best practices in the code to improve its overall security posture.

In conclusion, the provided code does not contain any immediate security defects, but there are opportunities for improvement to enhance its security. By implementing proper input validation, using an ORM, implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, handling errors properly, and following security best practices, the code can be further secured.
