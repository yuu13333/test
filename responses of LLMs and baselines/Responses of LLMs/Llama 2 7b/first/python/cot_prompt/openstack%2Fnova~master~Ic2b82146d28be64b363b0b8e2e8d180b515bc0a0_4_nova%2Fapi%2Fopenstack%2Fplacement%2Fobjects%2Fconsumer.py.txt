 Based on the provided code, I have analyzed it for security defects. Here are the results:
No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for object-oriented programming. However, I did notice a few minor issues that could potentially be improved upon:
1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
In some places, the naming conventions are not consistent. For example, in the `create_incomplete_consumer` method, the variable `consumer_id` is used, but in the `delete_consumer_if_no_allocations` method, the variable `consumer_uuid` is used. It is recommended to use consistent naming conventions throughout the code to make it easier to read
