 Sure, I analyzed the original code for security defects and found a potential issue.
Security Defect: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
The code uses the `security_groups` attribute directly in the `filter_ports` function without proper validation. An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious security group name, which could allow them to access ports that they are not authorized to access.
Line Number: 14
Solution: To fix this issue, the code should validate the security group name before using it in the filter. One way to do this is to use a whitelist of allowed security group names, and check if the provided name is in the whitelist before using it.
Here's an example of how the code could be modified to fix this issue:

No security defects are detected in the code.

Note: This analysis was performed based on the code provided in the commit message, and may not detect all potential security issues. It's important to thoroughly test and evaluate the code for security before deploying it in a production environment.
