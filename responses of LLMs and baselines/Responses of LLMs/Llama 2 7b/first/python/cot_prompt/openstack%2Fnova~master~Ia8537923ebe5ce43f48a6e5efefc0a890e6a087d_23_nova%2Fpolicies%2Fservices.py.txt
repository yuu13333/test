 After analyzing the generated code files, I found one potential security defect in the `os-services-defaults.py` file.
1. Insecure default roles:
The `os-services-defaults.py` file defines the following default roles:
* `system_reader`: allows reading of all services
* `system_admin`: allows updating and deleting of all services
These default roles could potentially expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to certain resources. It is recommended to define more specific and secure default roles, such as `system_reader:read_only` or `system_admin:read_write`, to limit the access to only the necessary resources and actions.
Line number: 14
Solution: Define more specific and secure default roles, such as `system_reader:read_only` or `system_admin:read_write`, to limit the access to only the necessary resources and actions.
Conclusion: No security defects are detected in the code. However, it is important to define more specific and secure default roles to limit the access to sensitive information and resources.
