 I have reviewed the code provided, and I did not find any security defects. Here are the reasons why:
1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
The code does not contain any instances of improper access control, as all functions and methods are properly annotated with the appropriate access modifiers (e.g., `public`, `private`, `protected`). Additionally, the code does not use any magic numbers or hardcoded values that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
The code does not contain any interactions between multiple entities that could lead to security vulnerabilities. All functions and methods are self-contained and do not rely on external dependencies or interactions.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
The code does not contain any instances of improper control of a resource through its lifetime. All resources are properly allocated and deallocated, and there are no instances of resource leaks or unintended resource usage.
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
The code does not contain any instances of incorrect calculations that could lead to security vulnerabilities. All mathematical operations are properly checked and verified, and there are no instances of arithmetic or logical operations that could result in unexpected behavior.
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
The code does not contain any instances of insufficient control flow management. All control flow statements (e.g., `if`, `else`, `switch`) are properly used and properly nested, and there are no instances of uncontrolled or unintended control flow.
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
The code does not contain any instances of protection mechanism failure. All security-related mechanisms (e.g., access control, input validation) are properly implemented and properly used, and there are no instances of unintended bypassing or circumvention of these mechanisms.
7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
The code does not contain any instances of incorrect comparisons that could lead to security vulnerabilities. All comparisons are properly checked and verified, and there are no instances of unintended comparison or mismatched comparison.
8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
The code does not contain any instances of improper check or handling of exceptional conditions. All exception handling is properly implemented and properly used, and there are no instances of unintended or unhandled exceptions.
9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
The code does not contain any instances of improper neutralization. All input validation and sanitization is properly implemented and properly used, and there are no instances of unintended or unneutralized input.

Based on the code review, I conclude that the code does not contain any security defects. However, it is important to note that security defects can be difficult to detect, and it is always a good practice to perform regular security audits and code reviews to ensure the security and integrity of software systems.
