 I have reviewed the code provided, and I did not find any security defects. The code appears to be well-structured and follows good coding practices.
The `QHstsPolicy` class appears to be designed to specify a host's support for HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). The class has several constructors and functions for setting the policy's expiration date, host name, and inclusion of subdomains. The class also has several methods for checking the policy's validity and expiration date.
The code uses the `QUrl` class for handling URLs, which is a secure and well-maintained part of the Qt framework. The `QDateTime` class is also used for working with date and time values, which is also a secure and well-maintained part of the Qt framework.
Overall, the code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security defects. However, as with any code, it is always possible that a security defect could be missed during review. Therefore, it is important to continue testing and evaluating the code to ensure its security.
In conclusion, I cannot find any security defects in the code provided, and it appears to be well-designed and secure.
