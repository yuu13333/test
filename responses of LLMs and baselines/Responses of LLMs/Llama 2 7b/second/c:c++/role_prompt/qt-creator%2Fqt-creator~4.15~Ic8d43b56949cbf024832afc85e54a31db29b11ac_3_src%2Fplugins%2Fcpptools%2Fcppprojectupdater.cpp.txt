 I have reviewed the provided code for potential security defects, and I found none. The code appears to be well-written and follows good coding practices.
Here are some observations and recommendations to improve the code's security:
1. Use of `QFutureWatcher` and `QFuture` for asynchronous operations: The code uses `QFutureWatcher` and `QFuture` to run the project info generator in a worker thread. This is a good practice to avoid blocking the main thread and to allow the user to continue working while the generator is running.
2. Use of `QTC_ASSERT` for error handling: The code uses `QTC_ASSERT` to handle errors in a robust way. It is recommended to use `QTC_ASSERT` instead of `Q_ASSERT` to avoid potential issues with the assert macro.
3. Use of `disconnect` and `connect` for toolchain management: The code uses `disconnect` and `connect` to manage toolchain events. This is a good practice to avoid keeping a reference to the toolchain and to ensure that the code is not affected by changes in the toolchain.
4. Use of `cancel` and `waitForFinished` for asynchronous operations: The code uses `cancel` and `waitForFinished` to cancel and wait for the completion of asynchronous operations. This is a good practice to ensure that the code is responsive and to avoid potential issues with cancelled operations.
5. Use of `QFutureInterface` for asynchronous operations: The code uses `QFutureInterface` to report the result of asynchronous operations. This is a good practice to ensure that the code is able to handle the result of the operation in a robust way.
6. Use of `QObject::connect` instead of `QObject::connectDirectly`: The code uses `QObject::connect` instead of `QObject::connectDirectly` to avoid potential issues with connecting to objects that are not directly accessible.
7. Use of `QMetaObject::invokeMethod` instead of `QObject::invokeMethod`: The code uses `QMetaObject::invokeMethod` instead of `QObject::invokeMethod` to avoid potential issues with invoking methods on objects that are not directly accessible.
8. Use of `QDebug` for debugging: The code uses `QDebug` for debugging purposes. This is a good practice to ensure that the code is able to debug and troubleshoot issues.

Based on the above observations and recommendations, I can confidently state that the provided code does not contain any security defects. The code is well-written, and it follows good coding practices to ensure the security and robustness of the application.
