 The code provided does not contain any security defects, and no security-related comments or directives are found in the code. The code is well-formatted and easy to read, which is a good practice for maintaining software security.
The code defines a `QHstsPolicy` class, which represents a host-specific HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy. The policy specifies a period of time during which a network access manager should only access a host in a secure fashion. The policy is defined by RFC 6797.
The code provides several member functions for setting and retrieving policy attributes, such as the host name, expiration date, and inclusion of subdomains. These functions are well-documented and easy to use.
The code also provides several operators for comparing and swapping policies, which can be useful in various contexts.
Overall, the code appears to be secure and well-written, with no obvious security defects or weaknesses. However, it is always important to thoroughly review and test any software to ensure that it is secure and meets the required security standards.
