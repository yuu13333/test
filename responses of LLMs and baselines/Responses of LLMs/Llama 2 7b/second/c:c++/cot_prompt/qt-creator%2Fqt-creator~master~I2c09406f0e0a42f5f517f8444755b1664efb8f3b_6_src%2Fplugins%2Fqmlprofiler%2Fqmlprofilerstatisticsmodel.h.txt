 After analyzing the generated code files, I found one potential security defect in the `qmlprofiler_statistics.cpp` file.
The defect is related to the `QmlProfilerStatisticsModel::finalize()` method, which is responsible for clearing the data members of the `QmlProfilerStatisticsModel` class. The method calls `m_data.clear()`, which is a valid way to clear the data members. However, it does not check whether `m_data` is actually empty before calling `clear()`.
Here is the code snippet that contains the defect:
```c++
void QmlProfilerStatisticsModel::finalize() {
    // ...
    m_data.clear();
    // ...
}
```
If an attacker can manipulate the `QmlProfilerStatisticsModel` instance during the execution of the `finalize()` method, they could potentially exploit this vulnerability to bypass the data clearing mechanism. For example, an attacker could set the `m_data` vector to a large size before calling `finalize()`, which would cause the `clear()` method to allocate excessive memory when trying to clear the data.
To fix this vulnerability, the `finalize()` method should be modified to check whether `m_data` is actually empty before calling `clear()`. Here is an updated version of the method:
```c++
void QmlProfilerStatisticsModel::finalize()
