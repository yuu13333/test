 After analyzing the generated code files, I found one potential security defect in the `qdslandingpage.cpp` file.
Security Defect:
The `QdsLandingPage` class has a member variable `m_qdsInstalled` that is used to store a boolean value indicating whether the QDS is installed or not. However, this variable is not properly validated, and its value can be tampered with by an attacker.
If an attacker were to set the `m_qdsInstalled` variable to `true` when it should be `false`, the application would incorrectly assume that the QDS is installed, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. For example, if the application is in a trusted environment and the attacker sets `m_qdsInstalled` to `true`, the application may allow the attacker to access sensitive information or perform malicious actions.
Solution:
To fix this security defect, the `m_qdsInstalled` variable should be validated and sanitized before being used in the application. One way to do this is to use a `QVariant` object to store the `qdsInstalled` value, and then validate and sanitize the `QVariant` object before using it.
Here is an example of how the `QdsLandingPage` class could be modified to fix this security defect:
```cpp
#include "qdslandingpage.h"
QdsLandingPage::QdsLandingPage(QWidget *parent) :
QWidget(parent) {
    // ...

    m_qdsInstalled = QVariant::fromValue<bool>(false);

    connect(widget()->rootObject(), SIGNAL(openQds()), this, SLOT(openQds()));

    // ...

}

QVariant QdsLandingPage::qdsInstalled() const {
    return m_qdsInstalled;
}

void QdsLandingPage::setQdsInstalled(const QVariant &value) {
    m_qdsInstalled = value;
}

void QdsLandingPage::openQds() {
    // ...

    if (qdsInstalled().toBool()) {
        // ...
    } else {
        // Handle the case where QDS is not installed
    }

    // ...

}

```

No security defects are detected in the code.
