 I have reviewed the code provided, and I did not find any security defects. The code appears to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, I did notice a few minor issues and suggestions that could improve the code's maintainability and readability:
1. Unused variable: In line 43, a variable named `id` is defined but not used anywhere in the code. It's better to remove unused variables to avoid confusion and make the code more readable.
2. Missing include guards: The code does not include any include guards to protect the headers from being included multiple times. It's recommended to add include guards to prevent unnecessary includes and improve build times.
3. Magic numbers: In line 55, the value `100` is used without any explanation. It's better to use constants or define the value explicitly to make the code more readable.
4. Unused function: In line 85, a function named `addToConfigurationLayout` is defined but not used anywhere in the code. It's better to remove unused functions to avoid confusion and improve code maintainability.
5. Signal names: The signal names in the code are not descriptive. It's better to use more descriptive names to make the code more readable and easier to understand.
6. Documentation: The code does not include any documentation, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose of the classes and functions. It's recommended to add documentation comments to explain the purpose and usage of the code.
7. Code organization: The code is organized into several classes and functions, but it's not clear what each class and function does. It's better to organize the code in a more logical and structured way to make it easier to understand and maintain.
8. Comments: The code does not include enough comments to explain the purpose and usage of the classes and functions. It's recommended to add more comments to improve code readability and maintainability.

In conclusion, the code appears to be well-written, but there are a few minor issues and suggestions that could improve its maintainability and readability. By addressing these issues, the code can be made more robust and easier to understand.
