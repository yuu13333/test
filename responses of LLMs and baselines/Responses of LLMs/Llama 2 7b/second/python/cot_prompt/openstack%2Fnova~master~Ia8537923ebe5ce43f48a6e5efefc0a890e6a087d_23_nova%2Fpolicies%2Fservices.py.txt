 After analyzing the generated code files, I found one potential security defect in the `os_compute_api.py` file.
1. Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in the `list_rules()` function (line 16):
The function takes a `service_id` parameter without proper validation. An attacker could provide any value for this parameter, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive policies.
Solution: Add proper input validation to the `list_rules()` function to ensure that only authorized users can access the function. For example, you can validate the `service_id` parameter using a whitelist of allowed values.
Corresponding line number: 16

No security defects are detected in the other generated code files.
