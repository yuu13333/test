 No security defects are detected in the code.
Here's a brief explanation of each security defect type and why they are not present in the code:
1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): This defect refers to improper control of access to sensitive information or system resources. The code does not grant unauthorized access to sensitive information or system resources, and proper access control mechanisms are in place.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities): This defect refers to improper interaction between multiple entities, leading to security vulnerabilities. The code does not have any interactions between entities that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime): This defect refers to improper control of a resource throughout its lifetime, leading to security vulnerabilities. The code does not have any issues with controlling resources throughout their lifetime.
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): This defect refers to incorrect calculations that can lead to security vulnerabilities. The code does not have any incorrect calculations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): This defect refers to insufficient control flow management, leading to security vulnerabilities. The code does not have any issues with insufficient control flow management.
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): This defect refers to failure of protection mechanisms, leading to security vulnerabilities. The code does not have any protection mechanism failures that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): This defect refers to incorrect comparisons that can lead to security vulnerabilities. The code does not have any incorrect comparisons that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): This defect refers to improper checks or handling of exceptional conditions, leading to security vulnerabilities. The code does not have any improper checks or handling of exceptional conditions that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): This defect refers to improper neutralization of potential security threats, leading to security vulnerabilities. The code does not have any improper neutralization of potential security threats that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): This defect refers to improper adherence to coding standards, leading to security vulnerabilities. The code adheres to coding standards and best practices, reducing the likelihood of security vulnerabilities.
In conclusion, the code does not have any security defects according to the CWE categories listed above. Proper access control mechanisms, proper interaction between entities, and adherence to coding standards and best practices have been implemented to ensure the security of the code.
