 No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be following best practices for Python coding and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.
Here are some observations and suggestions for improvements:
1. Consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions, which can make the code harder to read. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints: The code does not use type hints for function parameters, which can make it harder to understand the expected input types. Adding type hints can make the code more readable and easier to maintain.
3. Docstrings: The code does not have docstrings for most functions, which can make it harder to understand the purpose and behavior of the functions. Adding docstrings can make the code more readable and easier to maintain.
4. Function signature inconsistencies: The `ids_from_instance` function is defined in multiple places in the code, which can make it harder to understand the purpose of each function. It's better to consolidate the functions into a single function with a consistent signature.
5. Unused variables: The code has several unused variables that can be removed to simplify the code.
6. Comments: The code has some comments that are not necessary, and some comments are missing for important sections of the code. Adding comments to explain the purpose and behavior of the code can make it easier to understand and maintain.
7. Function signature inconsistencies: The `ids_from_security_group` function is defined with a different signature than the other `ids_from_instance` functions. It's better to use a consistent signature for all functions.
8. Missing type hints: The code does not have type hints for some of the function parameters, which can make it harder to understand the expected input types. Adding type hints can make the code more readable and easier to maintain.
9. Unnecessary `try`/`except` block: The `check_deltas` function has an unnecessary `try`/`except` block that can be removed. The `except` block catches a specific exception, but the `try` block catches a more general exception. It's better to remove the unnecessary `try` block and handle the specific exception directly in the `except` block.
10. Missing `obj_reset_changes` method: The `Quotas` class has a method called `obj_reset_changes`, but it is not defined. It's better to define the method and use it consistently throughout the code.

In summary, the code appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for Python coding. However, there are some minor suggestions for improvements to make the code more readable and easier to maintain.
