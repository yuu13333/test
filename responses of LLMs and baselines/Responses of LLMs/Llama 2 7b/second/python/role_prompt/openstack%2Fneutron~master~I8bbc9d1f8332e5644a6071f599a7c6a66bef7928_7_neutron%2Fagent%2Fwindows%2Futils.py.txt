 I have reviewed the code provided, and I did not find any security defects. Here are some observations and suggestions:
1. Line 14: It is a good practice to use the `os.path.join()` function to concatenate paths instead of manually concatenating strings.
2. Line 18: It is recommended to use the `eventlet.patcher.original()` function to restore the original `subprocess` module instead of modifying it directly.
3. Line 32: It is good to use the `eventlet.patcher.original()` function to restore the original `threading` module instead of modifying it directly.
4. Line 40: It is recommended to use the `os.environ.copy()` function instead of assigning directly to `os.environ`.
5. Line 50: It is a good practice to use the `LOG.debug()` function instead of `LOG.info()` for debugging purposes.
6. Line 56: It is recommended to use the `try`-`except` block instead of `raise`ing directly to handle exceptions.
7. Line 65: It is a good practice to use the `extra_ok_codes` list instead of hardcoding exit codes.
8. Line 75: It is recommended to use the `encodeutils.to_utf8()` function instead of manually encoding the input string.
9. Line 90: It is a good practice to use the `log_fail_as_error` variable instead of hardcoding `True` in the `log_msg` string.
10. Line 100: It is recommended to use the `tpool.execute()` function instead of directly invoking `f()` to ensure that the function is executed in a separate thread.
11. Line 122: It is a good practice to use the `get_root_helper_child_pid()` function instead of hardcoding `True` in the `run_as_root` variable.
12. Line 135: It is recommended to use the `process_is_running()` function instead of hardcoding `False` in the `log_fail_as_error` variable.

Based on the code review, I did not find any security defects in the provided code. However, I suggest following best practices and coding conventions to ensure the code is secure and maintainable.
