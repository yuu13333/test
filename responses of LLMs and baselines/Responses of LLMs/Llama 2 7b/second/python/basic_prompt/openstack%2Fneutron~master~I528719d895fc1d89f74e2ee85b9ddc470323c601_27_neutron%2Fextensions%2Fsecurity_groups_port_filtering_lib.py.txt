 No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be a Python module defining an extension for a network security management system, and it appears to be written in a secure manner.
Here are some observations and notes on the code:
* The code uses the Apache License, Version 2.0, which is a permissive open-source license that allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the code.
* The code defines several constants and variables that are used to store information about the extension, such as its alias, whether it is a shim extension, and whether it is a standard attr extension. These variables and constants are used throughout the code to determine the behavior of the extension.
* The code defines a function `get_resource_attribute_map()` that returns a dictionary of resource attributes for the extension. This function is used to define the attribute map for the extension.
* The code defines a function `get_sub_resource_attribute_map()` that returns a dictionary of subresource attributes for the extension. This function is used to define the subresource attribute map for the extension.
* The code defines a function `get_action_map()` that returns a dictionary of actions for the extension. This function is used to define the action map for the extension.
* The code defines a function `get_action_status()` that returns a dictionary of action statuses for the extension. This function is used to define the action status for the extension.
* The code defines a function `get_required_extensions()` that returns a list of required extensions for the extension. This function is used to determine the required extensions for the extension.
* The code defines a function `get_optional_extensions()` that returns a list of optional extensions for the extension. This function is used to determine the optional extensions for the extension.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and secure, with appropriate use of constants, variables, functions, and dictionaries to define the extension's behavior and attributes. The use of a permissive open-source license also allows for easy reuse and modification of the code by other developers.
