 No security defects are detected in the code.
The code appears to be a set of Python policies for the OpenStack Compute service, defining various rules for controlling access to instance actions. The policies are defined using the `policy` module from the `oslo_policy` package, and they use the `base` policy as a base policy.
The policies defined in the code include:
1. A policy that allows the admin or owner of a server to perform actions on that server.
2. A policy that adds a "details" key to action events for a server, beginning with Microversion 2.83.
3. A policy that adds events details in action details for a server, beginning with Microversion 2.51.
4. A policy that lists actions for a server.
5. A policy that shows action details for a server.

The policies are defined using the `policy.DocumentedRule` class, which allows for the definition of policies with documentation comments. The `check_str` parameter is used to specify the scope of the policy, and the `operations` parameter is used to specify the operations that are allowed or denied by the policy. The `scope_types` parameter is used to specify the scope types that are allowed or denied by the policy.
The code also includes a `deprecated_rule` parameter, which is used to specify a deprecated rule that should be ignored beginning with a certain Microversion. The `deprecated_reason` parameter is used to provide a reason for the deprecation, and the `deprecated_since` parameter is used to specify the Microversion after which the rule should be ignored.
Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and well-documented, with clear definitions of the policies and their scope. However, there are no security defects detected in the code.
