Based on the code provided, I have found no security defects or vulnerabilities. The code appears to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, I would like to highlight a few minor issues:
1. Line 32: It is a good practice to use a consistent indentation size throughout the code. In this case, the indentation size varies between 4 and 8 spaces, which can make the code harder to read.
2. Line 40: The `class KeepalivedUnixDomainConnection` definition is missing a closing `)` bracket.
3. Line 45: The `ip_address` variable is defined without a type hint. It is recommended to add type hints to variables to make the code more readable and maintainable.
4. Line 50: The `LOG` variable is defined without a type hint. Adding a type hint can make the code more readable and maintainable.

In conclusion, based on the code provided, I have found no security defects or vulnerabilities. However, I have identified a few minor issues that can be improved to make the code more readable and maintainable.
