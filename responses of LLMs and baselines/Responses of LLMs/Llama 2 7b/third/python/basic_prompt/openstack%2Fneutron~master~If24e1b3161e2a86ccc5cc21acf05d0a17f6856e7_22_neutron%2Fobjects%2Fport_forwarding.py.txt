 No security defects are detected in the code.
Here are some observations and clarifications regarding the code:
1. The code uses the `itertools` module to group the query results by the `router_id` field. This is a good practice as it allows for efficient iteration over the results.
2. The `FIELDS_NOT_SUPPORT_FILTER` constant is defined in the code to exclude certain fields from being filtered during iteration. This is a good practice as it helps to avoid unnecessary filtering and improves performance.
3. The `modify_fields_from_db` and `modify_fields_to_db` class methods are used to modify the fields of the `PortForwarding` object based on the values in the database. These methods are well-named and follow good coding practices.
4. The `get_port_forwarding_obj_by_routers` class method is used to retrieve a list of `PortForwarding` objects based on a list of router IDs. This method is well-named and follows good coding practices.
5. The code uses the `obj_fields.IPV4AddressField` and `obj_fields.PortRangeField` classes to define custom fields for the `PortForwarding` object. These fields are well-named and follow good coding practices.
6. The `fields_no_update` dictionary is used to specify which fields should not be updated during iteration. This is a good practice as it helps to avoid unnecessary updates and improves performance.
7. The `FIP_OBJ` variable is defined in the code to store the `FloatingIP` object associated with the `PortForwarding` object. This is a good practice as it allows for efficient access to the `FloatingIP` object during iteration.

In summary, the code appears to be well-written and follows good coding practices. However, there are a few minor suggestions that could be made to improve the code:

1. The code could benefit from using type hints for the `query` variable in the `get_port_forwarding_obj_by_routers` method. This would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
2. The `modify_fields_from_db` and `modify_fields_to_db` methods could benefit from using type hints for the `fields` parameter. This would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. The `FIELDS_NOT_SUPPORT_FILTER` constant could be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `ignored_fields`. This would make the code more readable and easier to understand.

In conclusion, the code appears to be well-written and follows good coding practices. However, there are a few minor suggestions that could be made to improve the code.
