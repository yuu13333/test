 No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, I did notice a few minor issues that could potentially be improved:
1. Inconsistent spacing: In some places, there are inconsistent amounts of whitespace between lines of code. It's generally best to keep the spacing consistent throughout the code to make it easier to read and maintain.
2. Duplicate variable names: In a few places, there are duplicate variable names used for different purposes. For example, `local_ip` and `local_ip_address` are used to represent the same thing. It would be better to choose a single name and use it consistently throughout the code.
3. Undocumented options: Some of the options in the `cfg.register_opts()` function are not documented. It's important to document all options used in the code to make it easier for others to understand how the code works and to ensure that changes are made consistently.
4. Deprecated options: Some of the options in the `cfg.register_opts()` function are marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future version. It's important to use the latest version of the code and avoid using deprecated options to ensure that the code continues to work correctly.
5. Missing comments: Some of the code lines do not have comments explaining what they do. Adding comments to the code can make it easier for others to understand how the code works and can help to improve code readability.

Overall, the code appears to be secure and well-written, but there are a few minor issues that could be improved to make the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
