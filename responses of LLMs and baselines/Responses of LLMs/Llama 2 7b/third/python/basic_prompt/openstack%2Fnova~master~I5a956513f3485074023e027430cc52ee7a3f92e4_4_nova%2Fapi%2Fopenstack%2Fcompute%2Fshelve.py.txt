 I have reviewed the provided code and did not find any security defects. Here are the reasons why:
1. The code does not use any insecure libraries or frameworks that could expose it to potential security vulnerabilities.
2. The code does not perform any sensitive operations, such as database queries or file access, without proper authorization and encryption.
3. The code does not use any hard-coded credentials or secrets that could be exploited by attackers.
4. The code does not rely on any external dependencies that could introduce security vulnerabilities.
5. The code does not use any obsolete or deprecated libraries or APIs that could be vulnerable to attacks.
6. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, such as executing arbitrary code or making untrusted inputs available to the application.
7. The code does not use any magic values or constants that could be exploited by attackers.
8. The code does not have any SQL injection vulnerabilities, as it does not use any SQL queries that could be exploited by attackers.
9. The code does not have any cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, as it does not use any untrusted inputs that could be exploited by attackers.
10. The code does not have any cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities, as it does not use any untrusted inputs that could be exploited by attackers.
Based on the above analysis, I can confidently state that the provided code does not contain any security defects.
