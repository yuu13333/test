 Based on the provided code, I have reviewed it for security defects using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard. I have found no security defects in the code.
The code appears to be well-structured, and it does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as:
* SQL injection (CWE-89): The code does not use any SQL queries, so this vulnerability is not present.
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) (CWE-75): The code does not handle user input, so there is no risk of XSS attacks.
* Buffer overflow (CWE-121): The code does not use any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, so this vulnerability is not present.
* Command injection (CWE-78): The code does not use any user-supplied input for command execution, so this vulnerability is not present.
* Path traversal (CWE-219): The code does not use any file or directory paths that could be manipulated to access unauthorized areas of the system, so this vulnerability is not present.
* Authentication bypass (CWE-287): The code does not bypass authentication mechanisms, so this vulnerability is not present.
* Information disclosure (CWE-345): The code does not disclose sensitive information, so this vulnerability is not present.
* Privilege escalation (CWE-306): The code does not escalate privileges, so this vulnerability is not present.
* Data tampering (CWE-307): The code does not manipulate data in any way that could lead to data tampering, so this vulnerability is not present.
* Uncontrolled resource usage (CWE-401): The code does not use any uncontrolled resources, so this vulnerability is not present.

In conclusion, based on the provided code, I have not found any security defects that could lead to vulnerabilities in the system. However, it is important to note that security defects can be introduced at any time during the development process, so it is essential to continue to review and test the code for security vulnerabilities throughout the development cycle.
