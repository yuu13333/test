 No security defects were found in the provided code. However, there are some potential security issues and best practices that should be considered:
1. CWE-284: Insufficient Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
The `KeepalivedStateChangeServer` class does not implement proper access control for handling HA state changes. The `run` method is not marked as `async` or `await`, which means that it can block the event loop and expose the server to potential attacks.

* Use `async` or `await` to ensure that the `run` method does not block the event loop.
