 Based on the provided code, I have identified the following potential security defects:
1. CWE-284: Improper Access Control - The `docker_build` function does not check if the input `server_list` is a list before iterating over it. This could lead to a situation where an attacker provides an invalid or malicious server configuration file, which could result in unauthorized access to the server.
2. CWE-435: Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities - The `docker_run` function does not check if the input `server_list` is a list before iterating over it. This could lead to a situation where an attacker provides an invalid or malicious server configuration file, which could result in unauthorized access to the server.
3. CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime - The `docker_exec` function does not check if the input `server_list` is a list before iterating over it. This could lead to a situation where an attacker provides an invalid or malicious server configuration file, which could result in unauthorized access to the server.
4. CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation - The `docker_rmi` function does not check if the input `server_list` is a list before iterating over it. This could lead to a situation where an attacker provides an invalid or malicious server configuration file, which could result in unauthorized access to the server.
5. CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management - The `docker_rm` function does not check if the input `server_list` is a list before iterating over it. This could lead to a situation where an attacker provides an invalid or malicious server configuration file, which could result in unauthorized access to the server.
6. CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure - The `docker_exec` function does not check if the input `server_list` is a list before iterating over it. This could lead to a situation where an attacker provides an invalid or malicious server configuration file, which could result in unauthorized access to the server.

No security defects were found in the code. The potential defects identified above are due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization, which could lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed. It is important to thoroughly review and test the code to ensure that it is functioning as intended and to identify any potential security defects.
