 The code appears to be vulnerable to the following security defects:
1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
In function `test_live_migrate_one_multi_created_instance`, the `original_host` variable is used to identify the host where the instance was created. However, this variable is not properly sanitized, and it could potentially contain malicious input. For example, an attacker could manipulate the `original_host` variable to point to a host that is not authorized to host instances, leading to unauthorized access to the system.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
In function `test_live_migrate_one_multi_created_instance`, the `post` object is created with a `host` parameter that is set to the target host. However, this parameter is not properly validated, and it could potentially contain malicious input. For example, an attacker could manipulate the `host` parameter to point to a host that is not authorized to receive instances, leading to unauthorized access to the system.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
In function `test_live_migrate_one_multi_created_instance`, the `servers` variable is created with a list of instances that are created in a multi-create request. However, the `servers` variable is not properly validated, and it could potentially contain malicious input. For example, an attacker could manipulate the `servers` variable to include instances that are not authorized to be migrated, leading to unauthorized access to the system.
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
In function `test_live_migrate_one_multi_created_instance`, the `migration_type` attribute is checked to ensure that it is set to `live-migration`. However, this check is not properly validated, and it could potentially lead to incorrect results. For example, an attacker could manipulate the `migration_type` attribute to set it to a value that is not authorized for migration, leading to unauthorized access to the system.
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
In function `test_live_migrate_one_multi_created_instance`, the `post` object is created with a `block_migration` parameter that is set to `auto`. However, this parameter is not properly validated, and it could potentially lead to incorrect results. For example, an attacker could manipulate the `block_migration` parameter to set it to a value that is not authorized for migration, leading to unauthorized access to the system.
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
In function `test_live_migrate_one_multi_created_instance`, the `api_fixture` is used to stub the `API` fixture. However, this fixture is not properly validated, and it could potentially lead to incorrect results. For example, an attacker could manipulate the `api_fixture` to stub the `API` fixture with a value that is not authorized for migration, leading to unauthorized access to the system.
No security defects are detected in the code.
