In conclusion, the code does not contain any security defects according to the CWEs and OSVs listed in the question. All the configuration options are properly defined and documented, and there are no instances of improper access control, interaction between entities, resource control, calculation, or flow management. Additionally, the push gateway configuration option is properly defined, and the help strings for all configuration options are empty strings, which is a good practice to avoid potential security vulnerabilities.
