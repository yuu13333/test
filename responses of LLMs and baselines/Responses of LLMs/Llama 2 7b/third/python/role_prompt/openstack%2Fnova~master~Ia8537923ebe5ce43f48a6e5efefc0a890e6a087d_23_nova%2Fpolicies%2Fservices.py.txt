 No security defects are detected in the code.
The code appears to be a set of OpenStack Nova policies for managing Compute services. The policies are defined using the `oslo_policy` framework and are based on the `base` policy. The policies include rules for listing, updating, and deleting Compute services, and they use the `check_str` parameter to specify the required permissions.
The code includes a `deprecated_since` parameter in some of the policy definitions, indicating that the policies are deprecated and will be ignored in a future release. However, this does not represent a security defect as the policies are still being documented and will be replaced with new policies in the future.
Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for OpenStack Nova policy definitions.
