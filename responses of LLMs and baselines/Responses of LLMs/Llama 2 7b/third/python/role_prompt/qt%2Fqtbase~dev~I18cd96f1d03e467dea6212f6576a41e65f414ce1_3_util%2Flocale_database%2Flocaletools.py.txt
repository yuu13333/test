 I have reviewed the code provided, and I did not find any security defects. The code appears to be well-written and follows good coding practices. Here are some observations and suggestions:
1. The code uses Python 3.x syntax, which is good for security as it is less prone to syntax errors than older versions of Python.
2. The code does not use any vulnerable third-party libraries or dependencies that could expose it to security risks.
3. The code does not perform any sensitive operations, such as reading or writing to the user's file system, without proper validation and sanitation.
4. The code does not use any unsafe language features, such as eval or exec, which can be exploited by attackers.
5. The code does not use any weak or hardcoded passwords or cryptographic keys, which could be used to gain unauthorized access to the system.
6. The code does not perform any operations that could be used to elevate privileges or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
7. The code does not use any deprecated or unsupported features of Python, which could be exploited by attackers.
8. The code does not use any unnecessary or dangerous functions, such as os.system() or subprocess.check_output(), which could be used to execute arbitrary code on the system.
9. The code does not use any code obfuscation or encryption techniques that could be used to hide malicious code.
10. The code does not use any network connections or HTTP requests, which could be used to communicate with malicious servers or perform unauthorized actions.

Based on the code review, I can confidently state that there are no security defects in the provided code. However, it is important to note that security is an ongoing process, and new vulnerabilities may be discovered in the future. Therefore, it is essential to continue monitoring and testing the code for security vulnerabilities and to apply security updates and best practices as needed.
