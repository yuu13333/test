 I have reviewed the provided code for security defects, and I did not find any significant issues. Here are some minor observations and suggestions for improvement:
1. Lack of docstrings:
Some of the functions and classes in the code do not have docstrings, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand their purpose and usage. It is recommended to add docstrings to all functions and classes to improve code readability.
2. Missing type hints:
Some of the function parameters and return types are missing type hints, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand the expected input types and return values. It is recommended to add type hints to all function parameters and return types to improve code readability and reduce errors.
3. Unused variables:

Some variables are defined but not used in the code, which can make the code harder to read and maintain. It is recommended to remove unused variables to improve code readability and reduce clutter.
4. Magic numbers:

Some values in the code are hardcoded with magic numbers, which can make it difficult to understand the intent of the code and make it harder to maintain. It is recommended to use named constants or variables instead of hardcoded magic numbers to improve code readability and reduce errors.
5. Inconsistent naming conventions:

The code uses both snake_case and camelCase naming conventions, which can make it harder to read and understand. It is recommended to use a consistent naming convention throughout the code to improve code readability.

No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be well-structured, and it does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. However, as with any code, it is important to continue testing and reviewing the code to ensure that it meets the security requirements of the project.
