 Based on the provided code, I have analyzed it for security defects, and here are my findings:
No security defects are detected in the code. The provided code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as:
1. SQL injection: The code does not use any user-input data directly in SQL queries, and the use of parameterized queries mitigates the risk of SQL injection attacks.
2. Cross-site scripting (XSS): The code does not use any user-input data directly in HTML output, and the use of the `html.escape` function mitigates the risk of XSS attacks.
3. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): The code does not use any sensitive data that could be exploited for CSRF attacks.
4. File inclusion vulnerabilities: The code does not use any unsafe file inclusions that could lead to code execution attacks.
5. Buffer overflows: The code does not use any dangerous buffer operations that could lead to buffer overflow attacks.

In conclusion, the provided code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security defects. However, it is important to note that security is an ongoing process, and new vulnerabilities may be introduced in the future. Therefore, it is essential to continue monitoring and testing the code for security vulnerabilities.
