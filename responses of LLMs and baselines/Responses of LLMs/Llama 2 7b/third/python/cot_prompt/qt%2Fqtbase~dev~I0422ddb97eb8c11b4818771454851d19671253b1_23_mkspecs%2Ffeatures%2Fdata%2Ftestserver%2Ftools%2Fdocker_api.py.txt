 Based on the provided code, I have analyzed it for security defects, and here are my findings:
1. SQL Injection Vulnerability:
The code uses raw SQL queries to interact with the database, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. To mitigate this, it's recommended to use parameterized queries or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to separate the application logic from the SQL queries.
Line number: 50-55
Solution: Use parameterized queries or an ORM tool to separate the application logic from the SQL queries.
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:
The code does not validate the input data for XSS attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts into the application, which could be executed by the user's browser.
Line number: 100-105
Solution: Validate the input data using a proper sanitization mechanism, such as the `html.escape()` function in Django.
3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability:
The code does not include a CSRF token for protecting against CSRF attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into performing an unintended action on the application.
