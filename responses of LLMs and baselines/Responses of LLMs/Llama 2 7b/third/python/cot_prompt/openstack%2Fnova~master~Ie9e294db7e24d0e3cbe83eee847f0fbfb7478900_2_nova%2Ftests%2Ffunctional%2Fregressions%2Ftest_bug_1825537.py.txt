 Based on the code provided in the commit message, I have analyzed the original code for security defects. Unfortunately, I have found a potential security defect in the `finish_resize` method of the `ComputeDriver` class.
The defect is related to the handling of the `flavorRef` parameter in the `resize` method. The method takes a `flavorRef` parameter, which is a reference to a `Flavor` object. However, the method does not validate whether the `flavorRef` parameter is actually a valid `Flavor` object.
Here is the code that contains the security defect:
```
137     # ...
138         req = {'resize': {'flavorRef': flavorRef}}
139         self.api.post_server_action(server['id'], req)
140         server = self._wait_for_state_change(self.admin_api, server, 'ERROR')
141         # ...
```
The security defect is that an attacker could potentially pass a malicious `flavorRef` parameter to the `resize` method, which could lead to unauthorized access to the instance. For example, an attacker could pass a `flavorRef` object that references a different instance than the one being resized, which could result in the attacker gaining control of the target instance.
To fix this security defect, the `resize` method should validate that the `flavorRef` parameter is actually a valid `Flavor` object that references the instance being resized. This can be done by using the `isinstance()` function in Python to check the type of the `flavorRef` parameter.
Here is an updated version of the `resize` method that fixes the security defect:
```
137     # ...
138         req = {'resize': {'flavorRef': flavorRef}}
139         if isinstance(flavorRef, Flavor):
140             # ...

```
By using the `isinstance()` function to validate the type of the `flavorRef` parameter, the method ensures that the parameter is actually a valid `Flavor` object before proceeding with the resize operation. This fixes the security defect by preventing an attacker from passing a malicious `flavorRef` parameter to the method.
In conclusion, one security defect is detected in the original code for the `finish_resize` method of the `ComputeDriver` class. The defect is related to the handling of the `flavorRef` parameter and can be fixed by validating the type of the parameter using the `isinstance()` function.
