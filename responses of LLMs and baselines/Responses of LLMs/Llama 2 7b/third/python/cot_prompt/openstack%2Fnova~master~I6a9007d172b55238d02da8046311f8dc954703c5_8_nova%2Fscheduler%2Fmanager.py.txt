 I have analyzed the generated code for security defects, and here are my findings:
1. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):
Line number: 140
The `select_destinations` method accepts a `return_alternates` parameter, which can be `True` or `False`. However, there is no proper validation done to ensure that this parameter is passed with the correct value. An attacker could exploit this by passing a malicious value to the `return_alternates` parameter, potentially leading to IDOR vulnerabilities.
Solution: Add proper validation to the `select_destinations` method to ensure that the `return_alternates` parameter is passed with the correct value.
2. SQL Injection:
Line number: 169
The `update_instance_info` method uses raw SQL queries to update the instance information. This could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if an attacker were to submit malicious input.
Solution: Use parameterized queries instead of raw SQL queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
Line number:
