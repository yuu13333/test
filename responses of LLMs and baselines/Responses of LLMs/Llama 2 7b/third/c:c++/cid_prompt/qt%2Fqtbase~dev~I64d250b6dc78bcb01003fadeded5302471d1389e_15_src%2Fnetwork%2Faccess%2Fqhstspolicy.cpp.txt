 The code does not contain any security defects according to the types of security defects you have specified. Here are the reasons why:
1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): The class `QHstsPolicy` does not have any member functions that modify the state of the object without proper validation or checking. Therefore, there is no risk of unauthorized access to the object's state.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities): The class `QHstsPolicy` does not interact with any other entities, so there is no risk of improper interaction between multiple entities.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime): The class `QHstsPolicy` does not have any member functions that modify the resource lifetime, so there is no risk of improper control of a resource through its lifetime.
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): The class `QHstsPolicy` does not perform any calculations that could lead to an incorrect result.
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): The class `QHstsPolicy` does not have any member functions that could lead to an insufficient control flow.
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): The class `QHstsPolicy` does not have any protection mechanism failure, as it does not provide any security features.
7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): The class `QHstsPolicy` does not perform any incorrect comparisons that could lead to a security vulnerability.
8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): The class `QHstsPolicy` does not have any member functions that could lead to an improper check or handling of exceptional conditions.
9. CWE-707 (Incorrect Neutralization): The class `QHstsPolicy` does not perform any incorrect neutralization, as it does not provide any security features.

Based on the code review, there are no security defects detected in the code. However, it is important to note that this code review only covers the security defects mentioned in the CWE types you provided, and it is possible that other security defects may exist in the code. Therefore, it is essential to perform a comprehensive security review of the code to identify any potential security vulnerabilities.
