 Based on the provided code, here are some potential security defects and their corresponding lines:
1. CWE-284: Improper Access Control - Line 25: `QMap<int, int> map;`
The `QMap` class is created without specifying any access control, which means that the map can be accessed and modified by any user. To fix this defect, you can add access control to the `QMap` class, for example, by using a `QMutex` or `QLock` to protect the map.
2. CWE-435: Improper Protection Mechanism - Lines 30-32: `QBENCHMARK {...}`
The `QBENCHMARK` macro is used to measure the performance of the map. However, it does not provide any protection mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to the map. To fix this defect, you can use a `QMutex` or `QLock` to protect the map during the measurement.
3. CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime - Lines 50-52: `QBENCHMARK {...}`
The `QBENCHMARK` macro does not provide any control over the resource (i.e., the map) throughout its lifetime. To fix this defect, you can use a `QMutex` or `QLock` to protect the map throughout its lifetime.
4. CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation - Lines 123-125: `int sum = 0;`
The `sum` variable is initialized to 0, but it is not updated correctly during the measurement. To fix this defect
