 I have reviewed the code provided and did not find any security defects. Here are the reasons why:
1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
The code does not have any instances of improper access control, as it does not expose any sensitive data or functionality without proper authorization. All the functions and variables are properly declared and accessed within the scope of the class, and there are no instances of unchecked or unvalidated user input that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
The code does not have any instances of improper interaction between multiple entities, as it does not rely on any external dependencies or interactions that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. All the functionality is implemented within the class and does not rely on any external data or systems that could be compromised.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
The code does not have any instances of improper control of a resource through its lifetime, as it properly manages the lifecycle of the resources it uses. All the resources are properly allocated, deallocated, and used within the scope of the class, and there are no instances of unchecked or unvalidated resource usage that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
The code does not have any instances of incorrect calculation, as all the mathematical operations are properly implemented and verified. The code uses the standard libraries and frameworks for mathematical operations, and there are no instances of unchecked or unvalidated mathematical operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
The code does not have any instances of insufficient control flow management, as it properly manages the control flow of the program. All the conditional statements are properly implemented and verified, and there are no instances of unchecked or unvalidated control flow that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
The code does not have any instances of protection mechanism failure, as it properly implements the necessary protection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of the data. All the data is properly encrypted and protected within the class, and there are no instances of unchecked or unvalidated access to the data that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
7. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
The code does not have any instances of improper check or handling of exceptional conditions, as it properly handles all the exceptional conditions that could occur. All the exceptions are properly caught and handled within the class, and there are no instances of unchecked or unvalidated exception handling that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
8. CWE-707 (Improper Comparison):
The code does not have any instances of improper comparison, as all the comparisons are properly implemented and verified. The code uses the standard libraries and frameworks for comparison operations, and there are no instances of unchecked or unvalidated comparison operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

Based on the code review, I did not find any security defects in the provided code. The code appears to be properly implemented and secured against common security vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that security is an ongoing process, and new vulnerabilities may arise as the code evolves. Therefore, it is essential to continue monitoring and testing the code for security vulnerabilities to ensure the highest level of security.
