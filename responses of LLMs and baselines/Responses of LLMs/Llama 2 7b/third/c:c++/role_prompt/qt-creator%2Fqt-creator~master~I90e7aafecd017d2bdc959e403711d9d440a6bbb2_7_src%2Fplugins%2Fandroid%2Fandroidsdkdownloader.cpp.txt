 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code appears to be well-structured, and it uses various Qt modules and libraries, such as `QDir`, `QLoggingCategory`, `QMessageBox`, `QProcess`, `QStandardPaths`, and `QNetworkRequest`. The code also includes various logging statements to help with debugging and error handling.

However, there are some potential security-related issues that could be addressed:

1. Insecure file permissions:

In line 65, the code sets the permissions of the downloaded SDK files to be executable by the user who downloaded them. This could potentially lead to security issues if the downloaded files are not properly validated or if they contain malicious code. It is recommended to use more secure file permissions, such as setting the files to be executable only by the user who downloaded them or using the `QFileDevice::Executable` flag.

2. Redirected HTTP requests:

In line 175, the code checks for HTTP redirects using the `isHttpRedirect` function. While this is a good practice, it is important to ensure that the redirected URL is valid and does not lead to a phishing attack or a malicious site. It is recommended to validate the redirected URL before following it.

3. Untrusted user input:

The code does not check for untrusted user input, which could potentially lead to security issues. It is recommended to use the `QUrl` class to validate the input URLs and to sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection attacks.

In conclusion, the code appears to be secure, but it is essential to address the potential security-related issues mentioned above to ensure the application's security.
