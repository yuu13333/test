 Based on the provided code, I have reviewed it for security defects using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard. Unfortunately, I found a few potential security defects in the code. Here are the details:
1. Insecure Direct Object Reference (CWE-434):
Line 34: `class QWasmDrag : public QSimpleDrag_p<QWasmScreen>`.
The `QWasmDrag` class inherits from `QSimpleDrag_p<QWasmScreen>`, which means that it uses a pointer to a class member variable `QWasmScreen` as its base class. This could lead to an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the base class pointer. For example, an attacker could create a custom `QWasmScreen` subclass that overrides the `QSimpleDrag_p<QWasmScreen>` base class's destructor, causing the `QWasmDrag` class to access invalid memory when it tries to access the base class pointer.
Solution: Use a smart pointer or a reference to the base class instead of a raw pointer to mitigate the IDOR vulnerability.
2. Use-After-Free Vulnerability (CWE-121):
Line 50: `m_mouseDropPoint = globalPos;`.
The `m_mouseDropPoint` member variable is assigned the `globalPos` variable without checking if it is null or not. This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the `globalPos` variable is null, as the `m_mouseDropPoint` variable will still be accessed and modified.
Solution: Add a null check to ensure that the `globalPos` variable is not null before assigning it to the `m_mouseDropPoint` variable.
3. Integer Overflow Vulnerability (CWE-105):
Line 53: `m_qButton = qAbs(b);`.
The `qAbs` function is used to calculate the absolute value of the `b` variable, which could lead to an integer overflow vulnerability if the value of `b` is negative. This could cause the `m_qButton` variable to take on an unexpected value, leading to unintended behavior.
Solution: Use the `qMax` function instead of `qAbs` to avoid integer overflow vulnerabilities.
4. Insecure Input Validation (CWE-20):
Line 55: `m_keyModifiers = b;`.
The `m_keyModifiers` member variable is assigned the `b` variable without checking if it is a valid modifier. This could lead to an insecure input validation vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the `b` variable to submit invalid input.
Solution: Add input validation checks to ensure that the `b` variable is a valid modifier before assigning it to the `m_keyModifiers` member variable.
5. Insecure Resource Management (CWE-268):
Line 60: `qWasmDrop();`.
The `qWasmDrop` function is called without checking if it is a valid function or not. This could lead to an insecure resource management vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the `qWasmDrop` function to perform an unintended action.
Solution: Add input validation checks to ensure that the `qWasmDrop` function is a valid function before calling it.

In conclusion, the provided code contains several potential security defects that could lead to vulnerabilities if not addressed. It is essential to address these issues to ensure the security and integrity of the application.
