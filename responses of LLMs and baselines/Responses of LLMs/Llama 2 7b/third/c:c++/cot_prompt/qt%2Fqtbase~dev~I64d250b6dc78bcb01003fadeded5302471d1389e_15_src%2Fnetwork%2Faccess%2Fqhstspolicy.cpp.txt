 Based on the code provided, I have analyzed it for security defects. Here are the results:
No security defects are detected in the code.
However, I would like to highlight one potential issue that could be improved upon:
1. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability:
In the `QHstsPolicy` class, the `setHost` and `setExpiry` methods use the `d->url` object to store the host name and expiration date, respectively. However, these objects are not verified to ensure that they are valid and trustworthy. An attacker could potentially manipulate these objects to set a malicious host name or expiration date, leading to a security vulnerability.
To address this issue, it would be best to validate and verify the input data before storing it in the `d->url` object. For example, you could use the `QUrl::fromEncoded` method to create a `QUrl` object from a string, and then validate the input data using the `QUrl::isValid` method.
Here is an example of how you could modify the `setHost` and `setExpiry` methods to address this issue:
```
class QHstsPolicy : public QObject {
public:
    // ...

    void setHost(const QString &host) {
        QUrl url;
        if (QUrl::fromEncoded(host).isValid()) {
            d->url = url;
        } else {
            qCritical("Invalid host name: %s", host.toLatin1());
        }
    }

    void setExpiry(const QDateTime &expiry) {
        QUrl url;
        if (QUrl::fromEncoded(expiry.toString()).isValid()) {
            d->expiry = expiry;
        } else {
            qCritical("Invalid expiration date: %s", expiry.toString().toLatin1());
        }
    }
```
By using the `QUrl::fromEncoded` method to create a `QUrl` object from the input data, and then validating the input data using the `QUrl::isValid` method, you can help prevent potential security vulnerabilities due to insecure direct object reference (IDOR).

In conclusion, no security defects are detected in the code. However, it is important to continue testing and evaluating the code for potential security vulnerabilities to ensure the highest level of security.
