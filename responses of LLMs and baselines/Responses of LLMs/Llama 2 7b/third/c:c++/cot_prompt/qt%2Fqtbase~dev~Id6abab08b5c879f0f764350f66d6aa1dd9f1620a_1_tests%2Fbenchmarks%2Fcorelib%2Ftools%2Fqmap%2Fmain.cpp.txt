 After analyzing the generated files, I found no security defects in the code. The code appears to be well-written and free of any obvious security vulnerabilities.
Here is a detailed analysis of the code for security defects:
1. Input validation:
The code does not perform any input validation for the integers passed to the `insertion_int_int`, `insertion_int_string`, `lookup_int_int`, and `lookup_int_string` functions. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if malicious input is provided.
Solution: Add input validation checks to ensure that only valid integers are inserted into the map. For example, the `insertion_int_
