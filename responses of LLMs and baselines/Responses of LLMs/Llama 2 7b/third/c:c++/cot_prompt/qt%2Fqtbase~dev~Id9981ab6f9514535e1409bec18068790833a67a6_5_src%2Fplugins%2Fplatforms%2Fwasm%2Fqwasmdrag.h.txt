 After analyzing the generated code, I have found one potential security defect in the `qwasm_drag.cpp` file.
Security Defect:
The `QWasmDrag` class has a member variable `m_mouseDropPoint` of type `QPoint`, which stores the position of the mouse cursor when the user drops an object. However, this variable is not marked as `const`, which means it can be modified by other parts of the code.
If an attacker is able to manipulate the value of `m_mouseDropPoint`, they could potentially use it to spoof the user's intentions when dropping an object. For example, an attacker could set `m_mouseDropPoint` to a position outside the viewport, which could cause the object to be dropped in an unexpected location.
Solution:
To fix this security defect, the `m_mouseDropPoint` variable should be marked as `const`. This will ensure that its value cannot be modified by other parts of the code, and the user's intentions will be respected.
Corresponding Line Number: 63

No security defects are detected in the rest of the code.
