 No security defects are detected in the code.
The code appears to be implementing a class `QHstsPolicy` that represents a HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy. The class provides functions for setting the policy's expiration date, host name, and whether subdomains should be included. The class also provides functions for checking if the policy is invalid, if it has expired, and if it includes subdomains.
The code uses standard C++11 features and does not appear to have any obvious security vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that the code does not provide any security features or functionality on its own, and it is up to the user to ensure that the policy is used correctly and securely in their application.
Some potential security considerations to keep in mind when using this class include:
* Ensuring that the policy's expiration date is set correctly and that the policy is updated when the expiration date changes.
* Ensuring that the policy's host name is set correctly and that the policy includes the correct subdomains.
* Ensuring that the policy is used correctly in the application's network communication, such as when setting the `QNetworkAccessManager::enableStrictTransportSecurity()` flag.
* Ensuring that the policy is not tampered with or modified in an unauthorized manner.
Overall, the code appears to be a valid implementation of an HSTS policy class, but it is important to use the class correctly and securely in the application to ensure the security of the network communication.
