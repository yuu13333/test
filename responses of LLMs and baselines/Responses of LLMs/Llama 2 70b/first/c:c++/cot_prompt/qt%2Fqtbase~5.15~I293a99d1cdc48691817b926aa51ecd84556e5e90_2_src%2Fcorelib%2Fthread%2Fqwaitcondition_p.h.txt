 After analyzing the generated files, I did not detect any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code uses the `std::condition_variable` class, which is not inherently secure. If used incorrectly, it can lead to race conditions, deadlocks, or other synchronization issues. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that the code using `std::condition_variable` is properly tested and reviewed to avoid any potential security issues.

Additionally, the code uses the `std::mutex` class to protect the `QWaitCondition` and `QMutex` classes. It's essential to ensure that the mutex is properly locked and unlocked around the critical sections of code to avoid any potential race conditions or other synchronization issues.

Lastly, the code uses the `std::chrono` class to handle time-related operations. It's essential to ensure that the time-related operations are properly handled and that no potential security issues arise from the use of this class.

In conclusion, while I did not detect any security defects in the code, it's essential to ensure that the code is properly tested, reviewed, and maintained to avoid any potential security issues that may arise from the use of these classes.
