 After analyzing the generated files, I did not find any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code is quite simple and does not include any security-related best practices. For example, the `MinimapSettingsPage` class does not validate user input, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the `Minimap` class does not implement any security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the minimap. For example, it does not check if the user has the necessary permissions to access the minimap or if the minimap is being accessed from an untrusted source.

Therefore, I recommend adding security-related best practices to the code to ensure that it is secure and robust. This could include input validation, access control, and encryption.

Line numbers are not applicable since the code is quite simple and does not include any security-related code.

Solution:

1. Add input validation to the `MinimapSettingsPage` class to ensure that user input is valid and secure. For example, you could use a regular expression to validate the input and prevent malicious input.
2. Implement access control measures in the `Minimap` class to prevent unauthorized access to the minimap. For example, you could use a permission system to check if the user has the necessary permissions to access the minimap.
3. Consider encrypting the minimap data to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
4. Use secure coding practices, such as using prepared statements for database queries and avoiding the use of raw user input in SQL queries.

By implementing these security-related best practices, you can ensure that the code is secure and robust, and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
