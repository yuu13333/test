 I have analyzed the generated code for security defects, and I did not find any security defects in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured, and it uses appropriate APIs to interact with the operating system and the Qt framework. The code also uses proper error handling and checking, which helps to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

The code uses Qt's `QElapsedTimer` class to measure elapsed time, which is a secure and reliable way to measure time. The code also uses the `QueryPerformanceCounter` and `GetTickCount64` functions to get the current time, which are secure and reliable ways to get the current time.

The code does not use any insecure or deprecated APIs, and it does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. Therefore, I conclude that the code is secure and does not contain any security defects.

Here is the complete code with the analysis:
```
#include "qelapsedtimer.h"

QElapsedTimer::QElapsedTimer() : t1(0), t2(0) {}
