 After analyzing the generated files, I did not detect any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the codebase is relatively small and focused on a specific functionality, which might limit the potential for security vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, it is essential to keep in mind that security is an ongoing process, and a comprehensive security assessment should be performed regularly to ensure the code's security.

In addition, it's worth mentioning that the code uses some outdated libraries, such as QT 5.12, which might have known security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it's recommended to keep the dependencies up-to-date and use the latest versions of the libraries to mitigate potential security risks.

In conclusion,
