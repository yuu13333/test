 After analyzing the generated files, I did not detect any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code uses a hardcoded maximum size for the buffer, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the size of the input data exceeds the maximum size.

In the file `QDuplicateTracker.cpp`, the buffer size is defined as `bufferSize` and is hardcoded to `257`:
```cpp
char buffer[bufferSize];
```
Although the code does not appear to have any security defects, it is generally a good practice to use secure coding practices, such as using secure functions for handling memory allocation and avoiding hardcoded values for sensitive data.

Therefore, I recommend using a secure method to determine the size of the buffer, such as using the `std::vector` class to dynamically allocate memory for the buffer, or using a secure function such as `std::scoped_array` to manage the memory for the buffer.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to use a secure method for allocating the buffer:
```cpp
std::vector<char> buffer(bufferSize);
```
Alternatively, you could also use a secure function such as `std::scoped_array` to manage the memory for the buffer:
```cpp
std::scoped_array<char> buffer(new char[bufferSize]);
```
By using a secure method to allocate and manage the memory for the buffer, you can avoid potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities and ensure the security of your code.

In summary, although no security defects were detected in the code, it is important to follow secure coding practices to ensure the security and integrity of your code.
