 I have detected a security defect in the provided code. The defect is related to the improper handling of SSL errors in the `sslErrors()` function.

The function is called for every SSL error that occurs during the download process, but it does not properly handle the errors. Specifically, it only logs the error message and does not take any action to address the issue. This could allow man-in-the-middle attacks to go unnoticed, potentially compromising the security of the downloaded SDK tools.

To fix this issue, the `sslErrors()` function should be modified to properly handle SSL errors. One solution is to use the `QSslError::ignoreError()` function to ignore the error and continue with the download process. Alternatively, the function could abort the download process and notify the user of the SSL error.

Here is the line number and corresponding solution for the detected defect:

Line number: 51
Solution:

Instead of only logging the error message, use the `QSslError::ignoreError()` function to ignore the error and continue with the download process. Alternatively, abort the download process and notify the user of the SSL error.

Modified code:
```
void AndroidSdkDownloader::sslErrors(const QList<QSslError> &sslErrors)
{
    Q_UNUSED(sslErrors);
    // Ignore SSL errors and continue with the download process
    QSslError::ignoreError();
}
```
Alternatively, you could also choose to abort the download process and notify the user of the SSL error.
```
void AndroidSdkDownloader::sslErrors(const QList<QSslError> &sslErrors)
{
    Q_UNUSED(sslErrors);
    // Abort the download process and notify the user of the SSL error
    QMessageBox::critical(this, tr("SSL Error"), tr("SSL error occurred during download process."));
    m_reply->abort();
}
```
By properly handling SSL errors, the security of the downloaded SDK tools is ensured, and the user is notified of any potential security issues.
