 I have detected a potential security vulnerability in the code.

The vulnerability is related to the use of the `QStack` class for storing event data. The `QStack` class is not designed to handle large amounts of data and can lead to stack overflows if used with large data sets. In this code, the `QStack` class is used to store event data for the call stack and compile stack, which can potentially lead to a stack overflow attack.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more appropriate data structure, such as a vector or a list, to store the event data. This will ensure that the data is stored safely and efficiently, without the risk of a stack overflow attack.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the code uses a hardcoded maximum size for the stacks, which is set to 100. This means that if the number of events exceeds 100, the stack will overflow, leading to undefined behavior. It's recommended to use a more flexible approach, such as dynamically allocating memory for the stacks, to avoid this issue.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to use a vector instead of a stack:
```
#include <QVector>

// ...

class QmlProfilerStatisticsModel : public QObject
{
    // ...

    private:
        QVector<QmlEvent> m_callStack;
        QVector<QmlEvent> m_compileStack;

        // ...
};
```

In summary, the vulnerability is caused by the use of the `QStack` class for storing event data, which can lead to stack overflows. To mitigate the vulnerability, it's recommended to use a more appropriate data structure, such as a vector or a list, to store the event data. Additionally, the code should be modified to use a more flexible approach for allocating memory for the stacks, to avoid undefined behavior.
