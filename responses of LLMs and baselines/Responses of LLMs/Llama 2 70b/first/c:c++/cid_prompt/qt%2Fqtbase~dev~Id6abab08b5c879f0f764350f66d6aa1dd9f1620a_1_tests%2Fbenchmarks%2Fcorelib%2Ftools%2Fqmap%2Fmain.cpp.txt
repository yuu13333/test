 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
The code uses both CamelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as `map` and `str`, are not very descriptive. It's better to use more descriptive names to make the code easier to understand. For example, `map` could be renamed to `myMap` or `theMap`, and `str` could be renamed to `theString`.
3. Function naming:
Some function names, such as `insertion_int_int()` and `insertion_string_int2()`, are quite long and may be difficult to read. It's better to use shorter function names that are still descriptive. For example, `insertIntInt()` and `insertStringInt2()` would be more concise and easier to read.
4. Comments:
The code has very few comments. It's important to add comments to explain what the code does, especially for complex functions or algorithms. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
5. Error handling:
The code does not handle errors well. For example, in the `insertion_int_int()` function, if the insertion fails, the function will crash. It's better to handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
6. Performance:
The code uses a lot of benchmarking macros, which may affect performance. It's better to use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code accordingly.
7. Code organization:
The code is quite long and complex, with many functions
