 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code is well-structured, and it is good to see that the developer has followed best practices for coding, such as using const correctness, private inheritance, and appropriate naming conventions. Additionally, the use of a private class for the policy data and a public class for the policy interface is a good design choice.

It's also worth mentioning that the code is using the QDateTime class for date and time operations, which is a good choice since it provides a convenient and efficient way to work with dates and times in Qt.

Overall, the code looks well-written, and I don't have any suggestions for improvement from a security perspective.
