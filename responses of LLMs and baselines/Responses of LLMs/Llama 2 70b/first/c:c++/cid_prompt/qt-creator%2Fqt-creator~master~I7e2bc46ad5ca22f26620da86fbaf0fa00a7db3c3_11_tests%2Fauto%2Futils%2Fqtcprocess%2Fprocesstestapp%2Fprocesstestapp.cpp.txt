 I'm sorry, but I cannot identify any security defects in the code. It appears that the code is well-written, following best practices for security and performance. The code is organized, with clear and consistent naming conventions, and it includes appropriate comments to explain its functionality.

I'm happy to help if you have any other questions or need assistance with a different code review.
