 I have detected a potential security defect in the code.

The function `QWasmScreen::updateQScreenAndCanvasRenderSize()` contains a call to `emscripten_get_element_css_size()`, which retrieves the CSS size of a HTML element. However, the function does not check whether the element is actually a descendant of the canvas element before retrieving its CSS size. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the CSS size of a different element and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

To fix this issue, it is recommended to add a check to ensure that the element is a descendant of the canvas element before retrieving its CSS size. Here's an example of how this could be done:
```
QByteArray canvasId = m_canvasId.toUtf8();
QDomElement canvasElement = QDomDocument::fromJson(canvasId.constData()).documentElement();
QDomElement element = canvasElement.querySelector("descendant-or-self::*[name()='div']");
if (element.isNull()) {
    // Handle the case where the element is not found
    return;
}
double css_width;
double css_height;
emscripten_get_element_css_size(element.toUtf8().constData(), &css_width, &css_height);
QSizeF cssSize(css_width, css_height);
```
By adding this check, the function will only retrieve the CSS size of elements that are descendants of the canvas element, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.
