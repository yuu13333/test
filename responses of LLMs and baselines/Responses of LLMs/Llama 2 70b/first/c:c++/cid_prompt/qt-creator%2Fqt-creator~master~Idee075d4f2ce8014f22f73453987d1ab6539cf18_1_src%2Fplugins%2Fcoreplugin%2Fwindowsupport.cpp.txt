 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For consistency, I recommend using camelCase for variable and function names, as it is the standard convention for Qt.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add comments and documentation to functions, variables, and classes to make the code easier to understand and maintain. This will also help others understand the purpose and usage of the code.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions, such as `m_shutdown` and `updateFullScreenAction()`. It's best to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code maintenance.
4. Complexity:
The code has a high level of complexity, with many interdependent functions and variables. It's better to break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions, and to use more descriptive variable names to improve readability.
5. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly. It's essential to add proper error handling and checking to ensure that the code can handle unexpected inputs and situations gracefully.
6. Security:
Although there are no security defects in the code, it's essential to keep security in mind when developing software. Proper input validation, error handling, and encryption are crucial aspects of secure coding practices.
7. Code organization:
The code is organized using namespaces, which is a good practice. However, it's better to use more descriptive namespace names to improve readability and make the code easier to understand.
8. Code style:
The code uses inconsistent indentation and spacing. It's best to follow a consistent coding style throughout the code to improve readability and make it easier to understand.

By addressing these suggestions, you can improve the quality, readability, and maintainability of the code, and ensure that it is more secure and efficient.
