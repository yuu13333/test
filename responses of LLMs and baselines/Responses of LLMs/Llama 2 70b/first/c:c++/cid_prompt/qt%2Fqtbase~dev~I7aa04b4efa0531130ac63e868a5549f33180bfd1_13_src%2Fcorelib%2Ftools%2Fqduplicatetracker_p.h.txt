 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few potential issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Missing `const` correctness: In some places, the code modifies objects without const correctness. For example, in the `QDuplicateTracker` constructor, `set` is modified without being declared `const`. Ensure that all objects are properly declared `const` where possible.
3. Unused variables: The code defines some unused variables, such as `primes` and `buffer`. Remove unused variables to reduce code clutter and potential bugs.
4. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. Add comments and documentation to explain the purpose and usage of the code, making it easier for others to understand and maintain.
5. Non-standard syntax: The code uses some non-standard syntax, such as `Q_DISABLE_COPY_MOVE`. Instead, use standard C++11/C++14 syntax for disabling copy and move semantics.
6. Compiler warnings: The code may generate some compiler warnings, such as "warning: unused variable 'primes'". Address these warnings and ensure that all code is compiled with minimal warnings.
7. Consistency in error handling: The code has inconsistent error handling. For example, some functions return a pair of a boolean and an integer, while others return only a boolean. Ensure consistency in error handling and consider using standard error handling idioms, such as `std::optional` or `std::expected`.
8. Use of `qsizetype`: The code uses `qsizetype` instead of `size_t` for some variables and functions. Ensure that `qsizetype` is properly defined and used consistently throughout the code.
9. Use of `QHashSeed`: The code uses `QHashSeed` without proper documentation or context. Ensure that `QHashSeed` is properly defined and used consistently throughout the code.
10. Use of `QSet`: The code uses `QSet` instead of `std::set` for some containers. Ensure that `QSet` is properly defined and used consistently throughout the code.

While there are no severe security defects in the code, addressing these issues will improve the code's maintainability, readability, and overall quality.
