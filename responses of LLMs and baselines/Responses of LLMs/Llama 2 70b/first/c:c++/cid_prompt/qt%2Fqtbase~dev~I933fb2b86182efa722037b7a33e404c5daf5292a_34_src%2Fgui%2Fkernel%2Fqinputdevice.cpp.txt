 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses some deprecated functions, such as `QMetaObject::className()` and `QObject::metaObject()`. These functions are deprecated since Qt 5.0 and should be avoided in new code. Instead, you can use `QObject::objectName()` or `QObject::className()` to get the name of an object.

Additionally, the code uses `QMutexLocker` to lock mutexes, which is not the recommended way to lock mutexes in Qt. Instead, you should use `QMutex::lock()` or `QMutex::unlock()` to lock and unlock mutexes.

Finally, the code uses `qAddPostRoutine` and `qRemovePostRoutine` to add and remove post routines, which are deprecated since Qt 5.0. Instead, you can use `QThreadPool::globalInstance()->addTask()` and `QThreadPool::globalInstance()->removeTask()` to schedule and cancel tasks.

Overall, while the code does not contain any security defects, it
