 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some observations and recommendations for improving the code quality and security:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add comments and documentation to explain the code's purpose, functionality, and parameters. This helps other developers understand the code and maintain it more effectively.
3. Unused variables: The code defines several unused variables, such as "prefix" and "suffix" in the "runInShellImpl" function. It's best to remove these unused variables to reduce code clutter and minimize potential security risks.
4. Hardcoded credentials: The code hardcodes the username and password for the shell process. It's recommended to use environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive information like credentials, rather than hardcoding them in the code.
5. Missing error handling: The code doesn't handle errors properly in some places. For example, in
