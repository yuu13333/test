 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's overall quality and maintainability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The codebase uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. While this doesn't necessarily introduce security vulnerabilities, it may make the code harder to read and understand for developers who are accustomed to a consistent naming style. It's recommended to stick to a single convention throughout the codebase.
2. Missing documentation:
Some functions and classes lack documentation comments, making it difficult for other developers to understand their purpose and usage without carefully reading through the implementation. Adding documentation comments can help improve the code's readability and maintainability.
3. Unused variables and functions:
There are a few unused variables and functions in the codebase. While this doesn't necessarily impact security, it can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It's recommended to remove unused variables and functions to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
4. Minor style issues:
There are some minor style issues in the codebase, such as inconsistent indentation and spacing. While these issues don't directly impact security, they can make the code harder to read and understand. It's recommended to enforce consistent coding styles throughout the codebase.

Overall, while there are no direct security vulnerabilities in the provided code, addressing these minor issues can help improve the code's maintainability and readability, which can indirectly contribute to better security.
