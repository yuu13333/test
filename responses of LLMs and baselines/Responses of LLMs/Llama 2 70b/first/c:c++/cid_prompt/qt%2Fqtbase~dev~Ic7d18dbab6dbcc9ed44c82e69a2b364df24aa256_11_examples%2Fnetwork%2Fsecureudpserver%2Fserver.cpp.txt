 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to explain the purpose and parameters of each function, as well as any assumptions or constraints.
3. Unused variables:
The code defines several unused variables, such as `serverConfiguration` and `cookieSender`. It's better to remove them or use them appropriately.
4. Complicated logic:
The code has a complex structure with many nested if-else statements. It would be better to break down the code into smaller functions each with a single responsibility, making it easier to read and maintain.
5. Missing error handling:
The code does not handle errors properly. It would be better to add proper error handling and error reporting mechanisms, such as using `Q_ASSERT` or `Q_CHECK` to verify assumptions, and handling errors gracefully.
6. Dependency on Qt versions:
The code uses Qt version-specific code, which can make it difficult to maintain and port to other versions. It's better to use version-independent code where possible.
7. Missing include guards:
The code lacks include guards, which can lead to multiple definitions of the same function or variable. It's better to add include guards to prevent such issues.
8. Redundant code:
The code has some redundant code, such as the `readyRead` function, which can be simplified or removed altogether.
9. Missing const-correctness:
The code misses const-correctness in some places, such as the `peerInfo` function, which can cause issues with code readability and maintainability. It's better to use const wherever possible.
