 I have reviewed the code and found a potential security defect.

The defect is related to the `qWasmDrop()` function, which is not properly sanitizing user-supplied data. The function takes a `QPoint` argument named `globalPos` that is not properly validated. An attacker could potentially exploit this by passing a malicious point value that could result in the execution of arbitrary code.

Line number: 61

Solution:

To fix this issue, you should validate the `globalPos` argument to ensure that it is within the bounds of the screen. You can use the `QScreen::screenRect()` function to get the bounds of the screen and then check if the point is within those bounds. If the point is not within the bounds, you should reject it and log an error.

Here's an example of how you could modify the `qWasmDrop()` function to address this issue:
```
void QWasmDrag::qWasmDrop() {
    QPoint globalPos = QPoint(m_mouseDropPoint.x(), m_mouseDropPoint.y());
    if (!QScreen::screenRect().contains(globalPos)) {
        qCritical() << "Drop point is not within the screen bounds";
        return;
    }
    // Rest of the function implementation
}
```
Additionally, you should also consider validating the other arguments passed to the `qWasmDrop()` function, such as `b` and `mods`, to ensure that they are valid and do not contain any malicious data.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
