 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the performance or maintainability of the code:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.
2. Unused variables and functions: The code defines several unused variables and functions, such as "ucs4lloWorld" and "ctorStdMap". Remove them to reduce code clutter and improve maintainability.
3. Complicated benchmarking: The code includes several benchmarking functions, but they are not clearly labeled or documented. It's best to use a consistent naming convention for benchmarking functions and provide clear documentation to explain their purpose and usage.
4. Missing const-correctness: Some functions, such as "insertion_int_int" and "insertion_string_int2", modify the map without const-correctness. Consider using const iterators or const-correct function interfaces to ensure thread safety and prevent accidental modifications.
5. Redundant checks: Some functions, such as "insertion_int_int_with_hint1" and "insertion_int_int_with_hint2", include redundant checks that can be removed. For example, the "
