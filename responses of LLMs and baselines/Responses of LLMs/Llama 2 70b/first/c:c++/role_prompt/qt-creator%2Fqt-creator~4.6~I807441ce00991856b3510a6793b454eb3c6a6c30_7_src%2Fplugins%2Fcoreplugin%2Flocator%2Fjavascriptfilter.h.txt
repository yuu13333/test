 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few best practices that could be applied to improve the code quality and maintainability:

1. Use consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Use meaningful variable names: Some variable names, such as `m_engine`, are not very descriptive. Consider using more descriptive names to make the code easier to understand.
3. Use const correctness: The `accept` function modifies the `selection` parameter, but it doesn't need to. Consider using `const` to indicate that the function doesn't modify the parameter.
4. Use exception handling: The `prepareSearch` function throws an exception if the JavaScript engine is not initialized. Consider using a try-catch block to handle the exception and provide a more informative error message.
5. Use modern C++ features: The code uses some older C++ features, such as `Q_OBJECT` and `QFutureInterface`. Consider using modern C++ features, such as `QObject` and `std::future`, to make the code more expressive and easier to read.
6. Use consistent spacing and indentation: The code has inconsistent spacing and indentation. Consider using a consistent style throughout the code to make it easier to read.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand. Following these best practices can make the code even better and more maintainable.
