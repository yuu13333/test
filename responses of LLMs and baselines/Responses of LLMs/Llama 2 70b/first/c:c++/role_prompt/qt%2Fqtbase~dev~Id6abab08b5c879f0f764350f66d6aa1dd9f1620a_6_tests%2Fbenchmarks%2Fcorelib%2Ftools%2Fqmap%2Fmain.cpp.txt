 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are not consistent. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Comments:
The code lacks comments in some places, making it difficult to understand what the code does. Adding comments would improve the code's readability.
3. const correctness:
In some places, the code uses non-const references to constants. For example, in the `insertion_int_int` function, the `map` variable is a non-const reference to a `QMap` object. It's better to use a const reference to ensure that the map is not modified accidentally.
4. Iterator usage:
The code uses iterators in some places, but it's not necessary to use them. For example, in the `insertion_int_int` function, the code uses `QMap<int, int>::const_iterator` to iterate over the map. However, since the map is not modified in the function, it's better to use a `QMap<int, int>::const_iterator` instead.
5. Unused variables:
The code has some unused variables, such as `ucs4lloWorld` and `XString`. It's better to remove these variables to reduce code clutter.
6. Unnecessary includes:
The code includes some unnecessary headers, such as `<qdebug.h>`. It's better to remove these includes to reduce code clutter.
7. Missing documentation:
The code lacks documentation for some functions and variables. Adding documentation would make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
8. Code organization:
The code is organized in a way that makes it difficult to understand how the different parts of the code fit together. It's better to organize the code into separate functions or classes to improve its structure and readability.

Overall, while the code appears to be secure, there are some improvements that can be made to make it more maintainable and readable.
