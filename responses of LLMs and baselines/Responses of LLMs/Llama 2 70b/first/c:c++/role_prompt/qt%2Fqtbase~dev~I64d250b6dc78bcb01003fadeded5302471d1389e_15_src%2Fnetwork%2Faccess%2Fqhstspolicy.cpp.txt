 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. It includes a detailed license agreement, which is a good sign that the authors have taken the time to consider the legal aspects of their work.

The class `QHstsPolicy` seems to be designed with security in mind, as it includes features such as expiration dates and the ability to include or exclude subdomains. The `setExpiry()` function takes a `QDateTime` object as a parameter, which suggests that the expiration date is stored in a secure manner.

The `operator==()` function is also well-implemented, as it compares the `QHstsPolicy` objects based on their host name, expiration date, and whether they include subdomains. This ensures that two policies with the same parameters are considered equal.

Overall, the code looks well-written and secure. However, it's always important to keep in mind that security is an ongoing process, and code should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it remains secure.
