 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's behavior or performance:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. While this is not a security issue, it can make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally a good idea to follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks documentation for many functions and variables. Adding documentation can help other developers understand the code's purpose and usage, which can reduce the risk of errors and security vulnerabilities.
3. Use of `emscripten::val`: The code uses `emscripten::val` for interacting with the Emscripten environment. While this is not a security issue, it's worth noting that `emscripten::val` can sometimes behave unexpectedly, especially when working with complex data structures. It's important to thoroughly test the code to ensure that it behaves correctly in all scenarios.
4. Use of `QByteArray`: The code uses `QByteArray` to store the HTML canvas's ID. While this is not a security issue, it's worth noting that `QByteArray` can be slower than other data structures for some operations. If the canvas ID is used frequently, it may be worth considering alternative data structures that offer better performance.
5. Missing error handling: The code does not handle errors explicitly in some places, such as when calling `emscripten_get_element_css_size` or `emscripten::val::global`. Adding error handling can help prevent the code from crashing or behaving unexpectedly when errors occur.
6. Use of `QPlatformCursor`: The code uses `QPlatformCursor` to store the cursor. While this is not a security issue, it's worth noting that `QPlatformCursor` can be deprecated in some cases. It's important to ensure that the code works correctly with the latest versions of Qt and Emscripten.

Overall, while there are no direct security defects in the code, following best practices for coding and using the latest versions of libraries can help prevent potential issues and improve the code's maintainability and performance.
