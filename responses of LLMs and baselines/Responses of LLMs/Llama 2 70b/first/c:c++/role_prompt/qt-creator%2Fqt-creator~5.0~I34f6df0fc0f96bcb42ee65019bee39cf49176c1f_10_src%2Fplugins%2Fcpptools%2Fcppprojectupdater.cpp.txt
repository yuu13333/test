 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for variable names and underscore for function names.
2. Variable naming:
Some variable names are not very descriptive, such as "m_extraCompilers" and "m_projectUpdateFutureInterface". Consider using more descriptive names to make the code easier to understand.
3. Function documentation:
The function documentation is lacking in some places. Consider adding docstrings to functions like "update", "onProjectInfoGenerated", and "checkForExtraCompilersFinished" to explain their purpose and parameters.
4. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors very well. Consider adding error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, to handle unexpected errors that may occur during the update process.
5. Code organization:
The code is quite long and complex. Consider breaking it down into smaller functions or classes to make it easier to maintain and understand.
6. Unused variables and functions:
There are some unused variables and functions in the code, such as "m_futureSynchronizer" and "CppProjectUpdaterFactory". Consider removing them or using them appropriately.
7. Code style:
The code uses both Qt and non-Qt style code. Consider following a consistent coding style throughout the code. For example, you can use Qt's style for naming conventions, indentation, and spacing.
8. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Consider adding more comments to explain the code's purpose, parameters, and return values. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there are some areas where it can be improved for better readability, maintainability, and security.
