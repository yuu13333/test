 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are not consistent. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Use const correctness:
In some places, the code modifies the map's contents during iteration, which can cause issues. To avoid this, use const correctness to ensure that the map's contents are not modified during iteration.
3. Use C++11/C++14 features:
The code uses some C++98 features, such as the "iostream" library and the "vector" class. Consider using C++11/C++14 features, such as the "iostream" library and the "vector" class, which can provide better performance and more concise code.
4. Use Qt's benchmarking framework:
The code uses the "QBENCHMARK" macro to measure the performance of some functions. However, it's better to use Qt's benchmarking framework, which provides more advanced features and is specifically designed for benchmarking Qt applications.
5. Add comments:
Some functions lack comments, which can make the code difficult to understand. Add comments to explain the purpose and behavior of each function.
6. Use inline functions:
Some functions are defined as inline, but they are not used as inline. Consider using inline functions to reduce the overhead of function calls.
7. Use constexpr functions:
Some functions can be defined as constexpr, which can provide better performance. Consider using constexpr functions where possible.
8. Use C++17's if constexpr:
C++17 introduced the "if constexpr" statement, which can provide better performance than the traditional "if" statement. Consider using "if constexpr" where possible.
9. Use std::pair:
The code uses the "QMap" class to store pairs of integers. Consider using std::pair, which can provide better performance and is more lightweight than QMap.
10. Use QMap's reserve function:
The code allocates memory for the map using the "QMap" constructor. Consider using QMap's reserve function to pre-allocate memory for the map, which can reduce the number of memory allocations and improve performance.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, there are some areas where improvements can be made to enhance performance, readability, and maintainability.
