 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some member variables are prefixed with "m_" while others are not. It's better to be consistent with the naming conventions throughout the code.
2. Use of Q_UNUSED:
The "Q_UNUSED" macro is used in some places to indicate that a variable or parameter is not used. However, it's not necessary to use it in all cases. For example, in the constructor of QdsLandingPage, the parameter "parent" is not used, but it's not necessary to add the Q_UNUSED macro for it.
3. Use of QString::fromLocalFile:
Instead of using QString::fromLocalFile to load the QML file, it's better to use QUrl::fromLocalFile to ensure that the file is loaded correctly, even if it's not in the same directory as the executable.
4. Use of signals and slots:
The code uses signals and slots to communicate between the QdsLandingPage and its widget. However, it's not necessary to use signals and slots in all cases. For example, in the show() function, the widget's rootObject() is set to the QdsLandingPage's m_widget, and then the show() function is called on the widget. Instead of using signals and slots, it's better to directly call the show() function on the widget.
5. Use of const correctness:
The code uses const correctness correctly in most places, but there are a few places where it could be improved. For example, in the qdsInstalled() function, the return value is not constant, but it could be declared as a const function.
6. Use of Utils::transform:
The Utils::transform function is used to transform a list of Utils::FilePaths to a list of QStrings. However, it's not necessary to use this function, as the QStringList::fromStdVector function can be used instead.
7. Use of QMetaObject::invokeMethod:
The QMetaObject::invokeMethod function is used to call the show() function on the widget. However, it's not necessary to use this function, as the show() function can be directly called on the widget.
8. Use of QObject::move:
The QObject::move function is used to move the widget to the QdsLandingPage's m_widget. However, it's not necessary to use this function, as the widget can be directly assigned to the m_widget member variable.

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, there are a few improvements that can be made to make the code more consistent, efficient, and easier to read.
