 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistency:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code for better readability.
2. Error handling:
The `buildTree()` function does not handle errors well. If an error occurs while building the tree, it will crash the program. Consider adding error handling mechanisms, such as returning an error message or displaying an error message in the UI.
3. Code organization:
The code is quite long and complex, making it difficult to understand and maintain. Consider breaking the code into smaller functions or classes to improve readability and maintainability.
4. Comments:
The code has minimal comments, making it difficult to understand what each section of the code does. Add comments to explain the purpose of each function, variable, and loop to improve code readability.
5. Security:
Although there are no security defects in the code, it's essential to keep security in mind when developing software. Consider using secure practices, such as input validation and error handling, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
6. Testing:
The code does not include any tests, making it difficult to ensure that it works correctly. Consider adding test cases to ensure that the code functions correctly and to catch any potential bugs.
7. Code style:
The code style is inconsistent, with varying indentation and spacing. Consider using a consistent code style throughout the code to improve readability.
8. Function signature:
The `addResultTypeToFunctionSignature()` function takes a `const QString &signature` as a parameter, but it modifies the signature. Consider using a `QString` instead of a `const QString &` to avoid confusion.
9. Variable naming:
Some variable names are quite long and complex, making them difficult to understand. Consider using shorter and more descriptive variable names to improve readability.
10. Code repetition:
The `buildTree()` function has similar code repeated multiple times. Consider extracting the repeated code into a separate function to improve code readability and reduce repetition.
