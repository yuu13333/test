 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Comments and documentation:
The code has minimal comments and documentation. Adding more comments and documentation can help make the code more readable and understandable, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future.
3. Error handling
