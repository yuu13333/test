The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code for consistency. For example, you can use camelCase for variable names and underscore for function names.
2. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as `keyNum`, `maxKeyCount`, and `releaseTimer`, are not very descriptive. It's better to use more descriptive names to make the code easier to understand. For example, you can rename `keyNum` to `numberOfKeys` and `maxKeyCount
