 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues with the code:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It is better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Unused variables: The code defines several unused variables, such as "seatName" and "parent". It is better to remove these unused variables to reduce code clutter.
3. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation for several functions and classes. It is important to add documentation to ensure that the code is easy to understand and use.
4. Compiler warnings: The code generates several compiler warnings, such as "warning: unused variable 'seatName'". It is better to address these warnings and remove unused variables.
5. Use of Q_GLOBAL_STATIC: Q_GLOBAL_STATIC is not thread-safe and should be avoided. Instead, consider using a thread-safe alternative, such as QMutexLocker.
6. Use of qAddPostRoutine and qRemovePostRoutine: These functions are not thread-safe and should be avoided. Instead, consider using a thread-safe alternative, such as QMetaObject::invokeMethod.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written, and I do not detect any security defects. However, addressing the minor issues mentioned above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and thread-safety.
