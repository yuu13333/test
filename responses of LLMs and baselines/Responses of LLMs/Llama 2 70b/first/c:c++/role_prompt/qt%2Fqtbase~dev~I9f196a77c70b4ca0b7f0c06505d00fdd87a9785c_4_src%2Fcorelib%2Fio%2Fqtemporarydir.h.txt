 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. The code uses both LGPL and GPL licenses. It would be better to clarify which license the code is using, as both licenses have different requirements and restrictions.
2. The code includes the `QDir` and `QScopedPointer` classes, but it does not use them directly. Instead, it uses the `QTemporaryDirPrivate` class, which is not included in the code snippet provided. It would be better to include the necessary includes and use the classes directly to avoid confusion.
3. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `d_ptr` member variable that is not initialized in the constructor. It is assigned a value in the move constructor, but it is not clear where the memory is allocated. It would be better to initialize the member variable in the constructor and document the memory management of the class.
4. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `path()` const method that returns a string. It would be better to return a `QString` instead of a string to avoid confusion and to follow the coding style of the Qt framework.
5. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `filePath()` const method that returns a string. It would be better to return a `QString` instead of a string to avoid confusion and to follow the coding style of the Qt framework.
6. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `remove()` method that is not documented. It would be better to document the method and clarify its behavior, especially since it is not clear whether it removes the temporary directory and its contents or just the directory itself.
7. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `setAutoRemove()` method that is not documented. It would be better to document the method and clarify its behavior, especially since it is not clear what happens to the temporary directory and its contents when the `QTemporaryDir` object is destroyed.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and follows the coding style of the Qt framework. However, there are some minor issues that could be improved to make the code more readable and maintainable.
