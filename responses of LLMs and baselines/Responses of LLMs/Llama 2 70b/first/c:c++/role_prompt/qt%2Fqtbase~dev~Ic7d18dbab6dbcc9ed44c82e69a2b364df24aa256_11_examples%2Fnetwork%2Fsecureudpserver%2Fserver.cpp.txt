 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add documentation to the functions, classes, and variables to make the code more readable and understandable.
3. Unused variables:
The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere. For example, the variable 'info' in the 'handleNewConnection' function is not used. It's better to remove unused variables to reduce code clutter.
4. Complicated conditionals:
The 'handleNewConnection' function has a complicated set of conditionals that can be simplified. For example, the 'if' statement that checks whether the 'peerAddress' and 'peerPort' are valid can be moved out of the 'if' statement that checks whether the 'clientHello' message is valid.
5. Missing error handling:
The code does not handle errors properly. For example, if the 'doHandshake' function fails, it will emit an error message, but it will not close the connection. It's better to add proper error handling to ensure that the connection is closed when an error occurs.
6. Use of Qt's 'Q_ASSERT' macro:
The code uses Qt's 'Q_ASSERT' macro in several places. While this macro can be useful for debugging, it's generally not recommended to use it in release code. Instead, it's better to use assertions that are compiled out in release builds.
7. Use of 'QStringLiteral' instead of string concatenation:
The code uses 'QStringLiteral' in several places to construct strings. While this is not wrong, it's generally more efficient to use string concatenation instead.
8. Use of 'quint16' instead of 'uint16_t':
The code uses 'quint16' to represent a 16-bit integer value. However, 'quint16' is a Qt-specific type, and it's generally better to use the standard 'uint16_t' type instead.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, but there are some areas where it can be improved for readability, maintainability, and security.
