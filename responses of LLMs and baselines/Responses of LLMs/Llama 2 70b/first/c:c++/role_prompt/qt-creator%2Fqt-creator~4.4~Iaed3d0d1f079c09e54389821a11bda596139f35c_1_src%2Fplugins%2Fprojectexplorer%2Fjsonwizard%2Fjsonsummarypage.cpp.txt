 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type annotations and variable naming:
Some variable declarations are missing type annotations, which can make the code harder to read and understand. Additionally, some variable names are not very descriptive, making it difficult to determine their purpose without reading through the entire code. Adding type annotations and using more descriptive variable names can improve code readability.
3. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have a consistent signature throughout the code, while others do not. For example, some functions use the "const" keyword for their parameters, while others do not. It's best to be consistent with function signatures to avoid confusion and make the code easier to read.
4. Comments and documentation:
The code has some comments, but they could be improved. Adding more comments and documentation can help others understand the code better and make it easier to maintain.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into namespaces and classes, but some functions and variables are defined in the global scope. It's best to minimize the use of global variables and functions and instead encapsulate them within classes or namespaces. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.
6. Error handling:
The code has some error handling mechanisms, but they could be improved. For example, some functions return a boolean value indicating whether an operation was successful, while others use a message box to display error messages. It's best to use a consistent error handling mechanism throughout the code.
7. Code style:
The code generally adheres to a consistent style, but there are some minor issues. For example, some lines are very long and could be broken up for better readability. Additionally, some braces are missing or misplaced, which can make the code harder to read. Following a consistent code style guide can help improve the overall readability and maintainability of the code.
