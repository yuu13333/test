 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, `WindowList` and `WindowSupport` should be renamed to `windowList` and `windowSupport` respectively, to follow the convention used in the rest of the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to the classes, functions, and variables to make the code more readable and understandable.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions, such as `m_shutdown` and `updateFullScreenAction()`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and make the code more maintainable.
4. Code organization:
The code is organized into different namespaces, but it's not clear why some functions and variables are in the `Internal` namespace while others are in the `Core` namespace. It would be better to organize the code in a way that makes it clear which functions and variables are part of the public API and which are internal implementation details.
5. Use of `QObject::connect`:
The code uses `QObject::connect` to connect signals and slots, but it's not clear why it's needed in some cases, such as in the `WindowSupport` constructor. It's better to use the `QMetaObject::connect` method instead, which is more flexible and allows for more efficient connection of signals and slots.
6. Use of `QAction`:
The code uses `QAction` to represent menu items and toolbar buttons. However, it's not clear why `QAction` is used instead of `QMenu` or `QToolBar`. It's better to use the appropriate class for the job to make the code more readable and maintainable.
7. Use of `QTC_ASSERT`:
The code uses `QTC_ASSERT` to assert that certain conditions are true. However, it's not clear why it's needed in some cases, such as in the `WindowList::activateWindow` function. It's better to remove unnecessary assertions to avoid cluttering the code with unnecessary checks.
8. Use of `QStringLiteral`:
The code uses `QStringLiteral` to create string literals. However, it's not clear why it's needed in some cases, such as in the `WindowList::updateTitle` function. It's better to use string literals directly instead of creating a `QStringLiteral` object.
9. Use of `QList<QWidget*>`:
The code uses `QList<QWidget*>` to store a list of widgets. However, it's not clear why it's needed in some cases, such as in the `WindowList` class. It's better to use a `QList<QWidget>` instead to avoid the need for explicit pointers.
10. Use of `ICore::instance()`:
The code uses `ICore::instance()` to get the instance of the `ICore` class. However, it's not clear why it's needed in some cases, such as in the `WindowSupport` constructor. It's better to pass the `ICore` instance as a parameter to the constructor instead of using a global instance.

Overall, the code seems to be well-organized and follows good coding practices. However, there are some areas where improvements can be made to make the code more readable, maintainable, and efficient.
