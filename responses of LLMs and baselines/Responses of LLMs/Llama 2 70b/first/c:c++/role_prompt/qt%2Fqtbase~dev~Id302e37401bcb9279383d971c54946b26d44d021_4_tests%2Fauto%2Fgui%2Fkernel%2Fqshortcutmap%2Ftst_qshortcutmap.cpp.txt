 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few best practices and suggestions that can improve the code quality and security:

1. Use const correctness:
In the `ColoredWindow` class, the `m_color` member variable is never modified, so it should be declared as `const`. This will prevent accidental changes to the variable and improve code readability.
2. Use Q_OBJECT macro correctly:
In the `tst_QShortcutMap` class, the `Q_OBJECT` macro is not used correctly. The macro should be used at the beginning of the class definition, before the class name, and it should be followed by a comma.
3. Use QTEST_MAIN macro correctly:
The `QTEST_MAIN` macro should be used at the end of the test function, after all the test cases have been defined.
4. Use QVERIFY and QTRY_VERIFY correctly:
In the `ownerDeleted_QTBUG_96551` function, the `QVERIFY` and `QTRY_VERIFY` functions are used incorrectly. `QVERIFY` should be used to check if a condition is true, and `QTRY_VERIFY` should be used to check if a condition is true after a certain number of retries. In this function, the order of the calls is incorrect, and the number of retries is not specified for `QTRY_VERIFY`.
5. Use descriptive variable names:
Some variable names, such as `badOwner`, are not descriptive and do not clearly convey their purpose. It would be better to use more descriptive names to improve code readability.
6. Use unique pointers:
The `badOwner` variable is created on the heap using `new`, but it is not deleted properly. It would be better to use a unique pointer, such as `std::unique_ptr`, to automatically manage the memory of the object.
7. Avoid unnecessary includes:
The file `tst_qshortcutmap.moc` is included at the end of the code, but it is not necessary to include it in the code. The `QTEST_MAIN` macro will automatically include the necessary files.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and most security defects have been avoided. However, following best practices and code conventions can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security.
