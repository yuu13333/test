 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Use consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Use meaningful variable names: Some variable names, such as "de" and "keyEvent," are not very descriptive. Consider using more descriptive names to make the code easier to understand.
3. Use functions for repeated code: The code has several places where the same functionality is repeated, such as the handling of key press and release events. Consider extracting this functionality into separate functions to reduce code duplication and improve readability.
