 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type annotations and defaults:
Some function parameters and variables lack type annotations, which can make the code harder to read and understand. Adding type annotations can help improve code readability and prevent potential issues.
3. Function documentation:
Some functions lack documentation, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand the purpose and usage of the function. Adding documentation comments can help improve code readability and make the code more accessible to others.
4. Error handling:
The code has several places where error messages are displayed to the user, but there's no clear error handling mechanism. It's better to handle errors more robustly, for example, by using a dedicated error handling mechanism, such as a custom exception class, to make the code more robust and user-friendly.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into several namespaces, but some of the namespaces are not clearly defined. It's better to define clear namespaces and organize the code accordingly, which can help improve code readability and make it easier to maintain.
6. Unused variables and functions:
There are some unused variables and functions in the code, which can make the code harder to read and maintain. It's better to remove unused variables and functions to keep the code clean and maintainable.
7. Code style:
The code style is generally consistent, but there are a few places where the code style can be improved. For example, some lines are too long, and some code blocks are not properly indented. It's better to follow a consistent code style throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written, and there are no major security defects detected. However, by addressing the above suggestions, the code can be further improved in terms of readability, maintainability, and user-friendliness.
