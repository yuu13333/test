 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. The code uses both `Q_CORE_EXPORT` and `Q_DISABLE_COPY` macros, which are both part of the Qt framework. It's not necessary to use both macros, as `Q_CORE_EXPORT` already implies that the class is copy-disabled.
2. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `d_ptr` member variable that is not initialized in the constructor. It's not a problem in this case, as the variable is assigned a value in the `QTemporaryDirPrivate` constructor, but it's a good practice to initialize member variables to avoid potential issues.
3. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `filePath` method that takes a `QString` argument. The method returns a `QString` object that is not allocated on the heap, which means that it's not automatically freed. It's a good practice to use smart pointers or `QString::fromStdString` to ensure that memory is properly managed.
4. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `remove` method that is not marked as `virtual`. It's a good practice to mark methods as `virtual` when they are intended to be overridden by derived classes.
5. The `QTemporaryDirPrivate` class has a `~QTemporaryDirPrivate` destructor that is not declared as `virtual`. It's a good practice to mark destructors as `virtual` when they are intended to be overridden by derived classes.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices.
