 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It is recommended to stick to a single convention throughout the code for better readability and maintainability.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to the functions, variables, and classes to make the code easier to understand and use.
3. Unused variables: The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `listViewModel` and `currentCertificatePath`. It is recommended to remove these unused variables to reduce code clutter and improve readability.
4. Complicated logic: The code has a complex structure with many interconnected functions and variables. It would be better to break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions, and to use more descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand.
5. Hardcoded paths: The code hardcodes the path to the SSL certificate file. It is recommended to use a configurable path or to load the certificate from a secure location, such as a user's home directory, instead of hardcoding it.
6. Insecure SSL configuration: The code uses the `QSslSocket::VerifyNone` mode, which disables SSL peer verification. This can be a security risk if the certificate is not properly validated. It is recommended to use a more secure SSL configuration, such as `QSslSocket::VerifyPeer` or `QSslSocket::VerifyNoneWithWarning`, to ensure that the certificate is properly validated.
7. Missing error handling: The code does not handle errors properly. It is recommended to add proper error handling and error messages to the code to ensure that the user is informed of any errors that may occur.
8. Dependency on external libraries: The code uses the `QSsl` library, which may not be available on all systems. It is recommended to use a more portable alternative, such as the `OpenSSL` library, to ensure that the code works on a wider range of systems.

Overall, the code appears to be secure, but there are some areas where it could be improved for better readability, maintainability, and security.
