 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are some minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add documentation comments to classes, functions, and variables to explain their purpose and usage.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code contains some unused variables and functions. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code size.
4. Compiler warnings:
The code may generate compiler warnings, such as "unused variable" or "unused function". It's better to address these warnings and remove unused code.
5. Consistency in formatting:
The code uses different formatting styles. It's better to use a consistent formatting style throughout the code to improve readability.
6. Use of "q" prefix:
The code uses the "q" prefix for some variable and function names. It's better to avoid using the "q" prefix for variable and function names, as it can make the code harder to read and understand.
7. Use of "Q" prefix:
The code uses the "Q" prefix for some class and variable names. It's better to use the "Q" prefix for class and variable names, as it follows the Qt naming convention.
8. Missing include statements:
The code lacks include statements for some headers. It's better to include the necessary headers to avoid compiler errors and improve code readability.
9. Redundant code:
The code contains some redundant code, such as the "durationPercent" function, which can be removed.
10. Code organization:
The code can be better organized by separating the implementation of the "QmlProfilerStatisticsModel" and "QmlProfilerStatisticsRelativesModel" classes into separate files. This can improve code readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, and there are no major security defects or issues. However, following the suggestions above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and consistency.
