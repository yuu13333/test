 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the performance or reliability of the application:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. While this is not a security issue, it can make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally a good idea to stick to a single naming convention throughout the codebase.
2. Missing error handling: The code does not handle errors when creating the UDP socket (line 71) or when writing the datagram (line 97). Adding error checks and appropriate error handling can help ensure the application is more robust and reliable.
3. Use of `QHostAddress::Broadcast`: The use of `QHostAddress::Broadcast` to send the datagram to all devices on the network may not be appropriate in all scenarios. Depending on the network configuration, this could potentially cause the application to send datagrams to devices that are not intended to receive them. It may be worth considering alternative ways to determine the target address, such as using a specific IP address or a multicast address.
4. Use of `QByteArray::number(messageNo)`: The use of `QByteArray::number(messageNo)` to create a string representation of the message number may not be the most efficient way to do this. Instead, consider using the `QString` class and its `QString::number` method to create the string representation. This can help avoid unnecessary memory allocation and copying.
5. Unused variable `auto quitButton`: The variable `quitButton` is not used anywhere in the code. It's generally a good practice to remove unused variables to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.

Overall, while there are no direct security defects in the code, addressing these issues can help improve the performance, reliability, and maintainability of the application.
