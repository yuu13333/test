 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few potential improvements that could be made to the code:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. Adding documentation comments to the functions and classes would make the code easier to understand and maintain.
3. Unused variables: The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere. These variables should be removed to reduce code clutter and improve readability.
4. Complexity: The code has a high cyclomatic complexity, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain. It's better to break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions.
5. Error handling: The code does not handle errors properly. It's better to add error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, to handle unexpected errors gracefully.
6. Unnecessary includes: The code includes some unnecessary headers, such as <QVariant>. It's better to remove these includes to reduce code clutter and improve build times.
7. Unused functions: The code defines some functions that are not used anywhere. These functions should be removed to reduce code clutter and improve readability.
8. Code style: The code uses inconsistent indentation and spacing. It's better to follow a consistent coding style throughout the code for readability and maintainability.

Overall, while the code appears to be secure, following best practices and coding standards can make it more maintainable, readable, and efficient.
