 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's maintainability and readability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's recommended to stick to a single convention throughout the code to improve readability.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add comments and documentation to the code to help others understand its purpose, usage, and potential pitfalls.
3. Complicated function signatures:
Some functions have lengthy and complicated signatures, making them difficult to read and understand. It's a good practice to break down such functions into smaller, more manageable pieces, and to use meaningful variable names to improve readability.
4. Unused variables and functions:
The code contains some unused variables and functions. It's recommended to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code maintenance efforts.
5. Missing error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors and exceptions properly. It's essential to add proper error handling and exception handling mechanisms to ensure the code's robustness and stability.
6. Dependency on external libraries:
The code depends on external libraries, which can create compatibility issues and make it challenging to maintain. It's recommended to use dependencies judiciously and explore alternative solutions that minimize dependencies.
7. Non-standard code formatting:
The code uses non-standard formatting, which can make it difficult for other developers to read and understand. It's recommended to follow standard coding guidelines and formatting conventions to improve code readability.

By addressing these issues, the code's maintainability, readability, and overall quality can be improved, reducing the likelihood of potential security vulnerabilities.
