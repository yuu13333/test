 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code appears to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. It uses constcorrectly, and the use of inline functions and variables is appropriate. The code also uses C++11 features, such as the use of auto and constexpr, which can help to improve code readability and maintainability.

The code seems to be focused on implementing a string converter class, which can convert between different character encodings. The class has a number of constructors and methods that allow it to be used in different contexts. The code also includes some inline functions and variables, which can help to improve performance.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and does not contain any obvious security defects. However, it is always possible that there may be security issues that are not immediately apparent, so it is important to thoroughly test and review the code to ensure that it is secure.
