 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation: The function "qCalculateBlockSize" is not documented. It's important to add documentation to functions to make the code more readable and understandable.
3. Unused variables: The variable "options" is not used in the function "allocateData". It's better to remove unused variables to reduce code clutter.
4. Unnecessary casts: The casts in the function "reallocateUnaligned" are not necessary and can be removed.
5. Missing return statement: The function "deallocate" is missing a return statement. It's important to include a return statement to indicate that the function has completed successfully.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and secure.
