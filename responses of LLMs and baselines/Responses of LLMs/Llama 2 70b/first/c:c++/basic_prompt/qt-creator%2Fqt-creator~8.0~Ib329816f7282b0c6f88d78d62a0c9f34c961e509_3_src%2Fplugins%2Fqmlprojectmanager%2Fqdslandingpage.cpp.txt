 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to the functions, classes, and variables to make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
2. Hardcoded paths:
The code contains hardcoded paths for the resource files (e.g., `LANDINGPAGEPATH` and `QMLRESOURCEPATH`). It would be better to use a more dynamic approach to locate these resources, such as using a resource file that contains the paths or using a configuration file that can be modified by the user.
3. Missing error handling:
The code does not handle errors properly. For example, if the `QQuickWidget::setSource` function fails to load the QML file, it will crash the application. It would be better to handle such errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to the user.
4. Unused variables and functions:
The code contains unused variables and functions, such as `m_widget` and `QdsLandingPage::openCreator`. It would be better to remove these unused elements to reduce code clutter and improve maintainability.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized in a way that makes it difficult to understand the relationships between the different classes and functions. It would be better to group related functions and classes together and use meaningful namespaces and directories to improve code organization.
6. Missing const-correctness:
The code misses const-correctness in some places, for example, the `QdsLandingPage` constructor modifies the `m_qdsInstalled` variable without const-correctness. It would be better to use const-correctness to ensure that the code is thread-safe and less prone to errors.
7. Missing inline documentation:
The code lacks inline documentation for functions and classes, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and usage of the code. It would be better to add inline documentation to improve code readability and understandability.
8. Missing unit tests:
The code lacks unit tests, which makes it difficult to ensure that the code works correctly and is free of bugs. It would be better to add unit tests to ensure that the code is functioning correctly and to catch bugs early in the development process.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there are some improvements that could be made to make it more maintainable, readable, and secure.
