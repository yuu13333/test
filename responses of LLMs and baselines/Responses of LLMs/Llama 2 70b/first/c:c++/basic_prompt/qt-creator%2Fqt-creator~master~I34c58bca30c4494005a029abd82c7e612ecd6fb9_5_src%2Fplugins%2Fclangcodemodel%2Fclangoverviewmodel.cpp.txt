 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Variable and function documentation:
Some variables and functions lack documentation. It's essential to add comments to explain their purpose and usage. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.
3. Function signature consistency:
The function signatures in the code are not consistent. Some functions use the "token" parameter, while others use "TokenInfoContainer." It's best to choose one convention and stick to it throughout the code.
4. Unused variables and functions:
There are a few unused variables and functions in the code. It's best to remove them to avoid confusion and keep the code clean.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into namespaces, but it could be further organized into smaller, more manageable functions. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.
6. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors well. It's best to add error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, to handle unexpected errors gracefully.
7. Code style:
The code style is generally consistent, but there are a few issues. For example, some lines are too long, and there are inconsistent spaces between brackets and parentheses. It's best to follow a consistent code style guide to make the code more readable.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and the author has made a good effort to follow coding standards and best practices. However, there is always room for improvement, and addressing the above issues will make the code even better.
