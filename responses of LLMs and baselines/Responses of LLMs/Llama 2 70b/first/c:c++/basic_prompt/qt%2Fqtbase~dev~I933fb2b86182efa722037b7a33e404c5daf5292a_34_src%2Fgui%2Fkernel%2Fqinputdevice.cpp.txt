 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add documentation to the functions, classes, and variables to make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and make the code more maintainable.
4. Compiler warnings:
The code generates some compiler warnings, such as "warning: 'QInputDevicePrivate' is not a member of 'QInputDevice'". It's better to address these warnings and ensure that the code is compiled without any warnings.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized in a way that makes it difficult to understand the relationships between the different classes and functions. It would be better to group related classes and functions together and use meaningful names to make the code more readable and maintainable.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, and I don't detect any major security defects. However, addressing the minor issues mentioned above would make the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
