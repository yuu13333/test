 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that may not be related to security but can still impact the code's reliability and maintainability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Unused variables and functions:
The code defines some unused variables and functions, such as `m_server` and `doStop()`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code maintenance.
3. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation for classes, functions, and variables. Adding documentation comments can help developers understand the code's purpose and usage.
4. Compiler warnings:
The code generates some compiler warnings, such as "warning: unused variable 'm_server'". It's essential to address these warnings to ensure that the code is reliable and maintainable.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple namespaces, but some functions and variables are not properly scoped. Properly scoping the code can help reduce naming conflicts and improve code organization.
6. Error handling:
The code has limited error handling mechanisms. It's better to add more error handling and checking to ensure that the code can handle unexpected inputs and situations gracefully.
7. Code style:
The code has some style issues, such as inconsistent indentation and spacing. Following a consistent coding style guide can improve the code's readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code appears to be secure, but addressing these minor issues can improve its reliability, maintainability, and readability.
