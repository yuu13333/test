 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured and follows good programming practices. It uses appropriate data structures, such as QMultiHash, to store the accessible interfaces and their corresponding IDs, and it properly cleans up the cache when objects are destroyed. It also includes debug logs to help identify any issues that may arise.

The code also includes a check to ensure that the accessible interface is not already in the cache before inserting a new one, which helps prevent duplicate entries. Additionally, it uses a unique ID range for the accessible interfaces to avoid conflicts with other IDs that may be used in the system.

Overall, the code appears to be secure and well-written.
