 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's behavior or performance:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. While this is not a security issue, it may make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally a good idea to follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase.
2. Unused variables and functions: The code defines several variables and functions that do not seem to be used anywhere. For example, the `QWasmCursor` class has an unused `name` function, and the `QWasmScreen` class has unused `cursor` and `topLevelAt` functions. Removing these unused elements can help simplify the code and reduce the risk of errors.
3. Missing documentation: The code lacks documentation for many of its functions and classes. Adding documentation can help other developers understand the code's purpose and usage, which can improve its maintainability and reduce the risk of errors.
4. Hardcoded values: The code contains several hardcoded values, such as the canvas ID and the HTML window's device pixel ratio. While these values are not necessarily security-related, they can make the code less flexible and harder to maintain. It's generally a good idea to use configurable values or calculate them dynamically instead of hardcoding them.
5. Use of `emscripten::val`: The code uses `emscripten::val` to interact with the JavaScript environment. While this is not a security issue, it can make the code harder to read and maintain, especially for developers who are not familiar with the Emscripten API. It's worth considering alternative approaches that may be more straightforward and easier to understand.

Overall, while there are no direct security defects in the code, addressing these issues can help improve its quality, readability, and maintainability.
