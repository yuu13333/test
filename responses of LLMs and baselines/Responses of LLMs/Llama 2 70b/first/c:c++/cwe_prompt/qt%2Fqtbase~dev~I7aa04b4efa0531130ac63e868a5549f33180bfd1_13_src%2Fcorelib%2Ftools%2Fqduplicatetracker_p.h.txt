 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code appears to be a implementation of a duplicate tracker using a hash table and a monotonic buffer resource. It seems to be well-structured and follows good coding practices.

The code uses C++14 features such as constexpr, inline, and decltype, which suggest that it is written in a modern style. It also uses the Qt library's macro Q_DISABLE_COPY_MOVE to disable copy and move semantics for the class, which is a good practice to prevent unintended behavior.

The code also includes a comment mentioning that it is part of the QtCore module of the Qt Toolkit, which suggests that it is a widely-used and well-maintained codebase.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and does not contain any obvious security defects.
