 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. The code uses `emscripten::val` to interact with the HTML canvas element. It would be better to use the `QWebElement` class from the `QtWebKit` module instead, which provides a safer and more convenient way to interact with HTML elements.
2. The `devicePixelRatio()` function uses `emscripten::val::global("window")["devicePixelRatio"].as<double>()` to get the device pixel ratio. This is not the recommended way to get the device pixel ratio, as it can cause issues with high-DPI displays. Instead, you should use `QGuiApplication::devicePixelRatio()` or `QScreen::devicePixelRatio()` to get the device pixel ratio.
3. The `updateQScreenAndCanvasRenderSize()` function sets the `width` and `height` attributes of the HTML canvas element using `emscripten::val::set()` calls. This can cause issues if the canvas element has any child elements, as it will overwrite their sizes. It would be better to use the `QWebElement::setAttribute()` method instead, which allows you to set attributes on HTML elements in a safer way.
4. The code uses `QPlatformCursor` to create a cursor object. However, this class is not part of the Qt API, and it is not recommended to use it. Instead, you should use `QCursor` to create a cursor object.
5. The code uses `QWindowSystemInterface::handleScreenGeometryChange()` to handle screen geometry changes. However, this function is not part of the Qt API, and it is not recommended to use it. Instead, you should use `QScreen::handleGeometryChange()` to handle screen geometry changes.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, there are some improvements that could be made to make it more robust and easier to maintain.
