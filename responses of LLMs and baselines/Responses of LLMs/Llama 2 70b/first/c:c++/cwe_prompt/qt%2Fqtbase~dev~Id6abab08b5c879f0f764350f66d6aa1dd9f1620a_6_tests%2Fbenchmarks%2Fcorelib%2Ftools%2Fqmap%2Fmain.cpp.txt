 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for variable names and underscore for function names.
2. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as "map" and "str," are not very descriptive. It's better to use more descriptive names to make the code easier to understand. For example, you can use "intToInsert" and "stringToInsert" instead of "map" and "str."
3. Function documentation:
The code does not include documentation for the functions. It's a good practice to include documentation for each function, describing what the function does, what input it takes, and what output it returns. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
4. Error handling:
The code does not include any error handling. It's a good practice to include error handling to handle unexpected inputs or situations. For example, you can include a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code.
5. Consistent indentation:
The code uses inconsistent indentation. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.
6. Unused variables:
The code includes some unused variables, such as "ucs4lloWorld." It's better to remove these unused variables to make the code more concise and easier to understand.
7. Redundant code:
The code includes some redundant code, such as the "ctorStdMap" function. This function is not necessary, as the "QMap" constructor can take a "std::map" object as its parameter. You can remove this function to simplify the code.
8. Unnecessary includes:
The code includes some unnecessary includes, such as "qdebug.h." It's better to remove these unnecessary includes to reduce the complexity of the code.
9. Missing returns:
Some functions, such as "insertion_int_intx," do not include a return statement. It's better to
