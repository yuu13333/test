 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured, and it is following good coding practices. It uses appropriate namespaces, includes necessary headers, and has helpful comments. The code also uses const correctness, which is an excellent practice for C++ programming.

The code also uses a theme chooser private class, which is a good design choice, as it encapsulates all the theme-related settings and logic in one place, making it easy to reuse and maintain.

The only minor suggestion I would make is to consider using a more modern C++ version, such as C++11 or C++14, which provides additional features and improvements over the C++98 standard used in this code. For example, C++11 provides a more concise syntax for anonymous inner classes, and C++14 provides general constexpr function support.

Overall, the code seems well-written and does not contain any security defects.
