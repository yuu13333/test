 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few potential issues that may not necessarily be security-related but could still impact the code's performance or behavior:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. While this does not affect the code's functionality, it may make the code harder to read and understand for some developers. It's generally a good idea to follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase.
2. Missing 'const' keyword: In the 'QThread::create' function, the 'f' parameter is not declared as 'const', which may allow the function to modify the original function object accidentally. Adding 'const' to the parameter declaration
