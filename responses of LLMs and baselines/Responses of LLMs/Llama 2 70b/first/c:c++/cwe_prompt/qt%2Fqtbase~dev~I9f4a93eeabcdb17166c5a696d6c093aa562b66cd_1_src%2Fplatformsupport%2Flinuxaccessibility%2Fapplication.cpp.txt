 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's reliability and maintainability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally a good idea to follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. Docstrings are missing for many functions, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand the code's purpose and usage. Adding clear and concise docstrings can improve the code's readability and
