 I have reviewed the provided code and did not find any security defects. The code seems to be well-structured and follows good security practices.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. The code uses the `Utils::QLibraryInfo` class to search for the `emrun` script, but it does not check if the script exists or if it has execution permissions. It would be a good idea to add some error handling to ensure that the script is present and executable before trying to run it.
2. The `emrunCommand` function takes a `Target` object as an argument, but it does not check if the target is valid or if it has a valid build configuration. It would be a good idea to add some error handling to ensure that the target is valid and that it has a valid build configuration.
3. The `EmrunRunConfiguration` class has a hardcoded list of command-line arguments that are passed to the `emrun` script. It would be a good idea to move these arguments to a configuration file or to a separate class that can be easily modified or extended.
4. The `EmrunRunWorker` class has a hardcoded reference to the `PortsGatherer` class, which is not ideal. It would be better to pass the `PortsGatherer` object as a parameter to the `start` method or to use a dependency injection mechanism to provide the `PortsGatherer` object.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, and I did not find any major security defects. However, there are some minor improvements that could be made to make the code more robust and maintainable.
