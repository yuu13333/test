 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Use const correctness:
In some places, the code modifies variables that are defined as const. For example, in the decodeKeyValues function, the 'offset' variable is defined as const, but it's being modified inside the loop.
