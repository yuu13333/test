 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that may be worth considering:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add documentation to the classes, functions, and variables to help other developers understand the code and make maintenance easier.
3. Unused variables and functions: The code has some unused variables and functions. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code size.
4. Compiler warnings: The code generates some compiler warnings, such as "warning: unused variable 'wasRemoved'". It's essential to address these warnings and remove unused variables or assign them a meaningful purpose.
5. Use of Q_GLOBAL_STATIC: Q_GLOBAL_STATIC is not recommended as it can cause issues with thread safety and performance. Instead, consider using a thread-safe approach, such as using a static variable inside a function or a QMutexLocker to protect the variable.
6. Use of qAddPostRoutine and qRemovePostRoutine: These functions are not recommended as they can cause issues with thread safety and performance. Instead, consider using a thread-safe approach, such as using a QTimer to schedule the cleanup.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and I didn't find any significant security defects. However, addressing the above points can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and performance.
