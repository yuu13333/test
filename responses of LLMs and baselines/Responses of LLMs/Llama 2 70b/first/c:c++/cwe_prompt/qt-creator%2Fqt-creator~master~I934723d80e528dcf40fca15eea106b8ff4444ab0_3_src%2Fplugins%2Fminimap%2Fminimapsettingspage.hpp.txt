 I have reviewed the code for security defects using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard. I did not detect any security defects in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. It uses appropriate includes, namespaces, and scoping to minimize the risk of common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS).

The code also uses QScopedPointer to automatically manage memory, which reduces the risk of memory-related vulnerabilities such as use-after-free or double-free.

The widget() function and apply() function are implemented correctly, and the member variables are properly initialized and cleaned up. The displaySettingsChanged() function is also well-implemented and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.

Overall, the code appears to be secure, and I did not identify any security defects.

However, I would like to suggest a few minor improvements to further harden the code:

1. Consider using a more secure version of the Qt framework, such as Qt 6, which includes several security-related improvements.
2. Use a consistent naming convention throughout the code. For example, some member variables use camelCase notation, while others use underscores. Consistency can make the code easier to read and understand.
3. Consider adding a comment to the widget() function to explain its purpose and return value.
4. In the apply() function, consider checking if the widget is nullptr before deleting it. This ensures that the function does not crash if the widget is not properly initialized.

In conclusion, the code appears to be secure, and I did not detect any security defects. However, implementing the suggested improvements can further harden the code and reduce potential security risks.
