 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, 'TokenTreeItem' could be renamed to 'tokenTreeItem' to follow the camelCase convention.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to the functions, classes, and variables to make the code more readable and understandable.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions, such as 'ClangBackEnd::ExtraInfo extraInfo;' and 'void addFirstItem(TokenTreeItem *root).' It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and improve code readability.
4. Complicated function signature:
The function signature of 'addResultTypeToFunctionSignature' is quite complicated. It may be better to break it down into smaller functions or simplify the signature to make it easier to read and understand.
5. Missing return statement:
The function 'buildTree' is missing a return statement. It should return the built tree to the caller.
6. Unnecessary variable:
The variable 'types' in the 'TokenTreeItem' class is not used anywhere. It can be removed to simplify the code.
7. Unnecessary include:
The include statement for 'CPlusPlus/Icons.h' seems to be unnecessary. The icons are not used anywhere in the code.
8. Missing const-correctness:
Some functions and variables are missing the 'const' keyword where it is appropriate. For example, the function 'addResultTypeToFunctionSignature' should be declared as 'const' since it does not modify the input parameters.
9. Redundant variable initialization:
The variable 'root' in the 'buildTree' function is initialized twice. The second initialization can be removed to simplify the code.
10. Missing namespace declaration:
The code uses the 'Utils' namespace but does not declare it. It should be declared at the top of the file to avoid confusion.

These are minor issues and suggestions for improvement. Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and secure.
