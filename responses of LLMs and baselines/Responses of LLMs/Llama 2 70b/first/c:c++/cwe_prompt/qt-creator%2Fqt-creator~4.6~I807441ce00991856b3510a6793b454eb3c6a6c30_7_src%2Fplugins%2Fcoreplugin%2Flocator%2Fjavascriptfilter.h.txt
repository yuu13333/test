 I have reviewed the code and found a potential security defect.

Line 45: `QList<Core::LocatorFilterEntry> matchesFor(QFutureInterface<Core::LocatorFilterEntry> &future, const QString &entry) override;`

The method `matchesFor` is overriding a virtual function from the `ILocatorFilter` interface, but it is not checking if the `future` object is valid before using it. This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the `future` object is already freed when the `matchesFor` method is called.

To fix this issue, you should check if the `future` object is valid before using it, for example:
```
QList<Core::LocatorFilterEntry> matchesFor(QFutureInterface<Core::LocatorFilterEntry> &future, const QString &entry) override {
    if (future.isValid()) {
        // Use the future object
        QList<Core::LocatorFilterEntry> matches = future.result();
        // ...
    } else {
        // Handle the case where the future object is not valid
    }
}
```
Alternatively, you could also use a `QFutureWatcher` to watch for the future object's completion and only use it when it is valid.
```
QFutureWatcher<QList<Core::LocatorFilterEntry>> watcher;
watcher.setFuture(future);
QMetaObject::invokeMethod(this, "matchesFor", Qt::QueuedConnection, Q_ARG(QFutureInterface<Core::LocatorFilterEntry>, watcher));
```
This will call the `matchesFor` method when the future object is completed and valid.

This is a potential security defect, and it should be addressed to prevent any potential use-after-free vulnerabilities.

Here is the corresponding CWE identifier: CWE-416: Use-After-Free.
