 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and PascalCase naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add documentation to the classes, functions, and variables to make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
3. Unused variables and functions: The code has some unused variables and functions. It's better to remove them or use them properly.
4. Complicated logic: Some parts of the code, such as the reconnect mechanism, are quite complicated. It might be helpful to simplify the logic and make it more straightforward.
5. Error handling: The code has a complex error handling mechanism. It's better to use specific error types and handle them appropriately instead of using a generic "error" type.
6. Unnecessary pointers: The code uses pointers in some places, but they are not necessary. It's better to use references or values instead of pointers.
7. Unused includes: The code includes some headers that are not used. It's better to remove them.
8. Unnecessary variables: The code has some variables that are not used. It's better to remove them.
9. Unclear variable names: Some variable names are not descriptive and do not clearly convey their purpose. It's better to use descriptive names that are self-explanatory.
10. Missing return statements: Some functions lack return statements. It's better to add them to ensure that the code is correct and easy to understand.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and there are no obvious security vulnerabilities. However, following best practices and improving the code's readability and maintainability can make it more reliable and efficient.
