 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for variable names and underscore for function names.
2. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as `map` and `str`, are not very descriptive. It's better to use more descriptive names to make the code easier to understand. For example, you can use `intToInsert` and `stringToInsert` instead of `map` and `str`.
3. Function documentation:
The code does not include documentation for the functions. It's a good practice to include documentation for each function, describing what the function does, what inputs it takes, and what it returns. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
4. Error handling:
The code does not include any error handling. For example, what if the insertion operation fails? It's a good practice to include error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, to handle unexpected errors.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple files, but it's not clear how these files are related. It's a good practice to organize the code into a logical structure, such as creating a separate file for each class or function. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
6. Include guards:
The code includes multiple include guards, such as `Q_OBJECT` and `QTEST_MAIN`. While these guards are necessary, it's a good practice to include them only once in the code, rather than duplicating them multiple times.
7. Consistent indentation:
The code uses inconsistent indentation. It's a good practice to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.
8. Unused variables:
The code defines some unused variables, such as `XString` and `ctorStdMap`. It's a good practice to remove unused variables to avoid confusion and reduce code maintenance.
9. Redundant code:
The code includes some redundant code, such as the `insertion_string_int2_hint` function, which is similar to the `insertion_string_int2` function. It's a good practice to remove redundant code to reduce code maintenance and improve readability.

Overall, while the code does not have any security defects, following best practices for coding conventions, variable naming,
