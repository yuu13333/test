 I have reviewed the code and found a few potential security defects. Here are my findings:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
Line 43: The `create_keypair` function creates a keypair with admin privileges, but it is not clear who or what process is supposed to have access to this keypair. It is recommended to restrict access to sensitive resources like keypairs to only authorized users or processes.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
Line 52: The `resource_cleanup` function deletes the security group created in the test, but it does not check if the security group is still being used by other resources. It is recommended to check for dependencies on the security group before deleting it.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
Line 71: The `create_server` function creates a server with a specific hypervisor and availability zone, but it does not check if the hypervisor and availability zone are still available when the server is created. It is recommended to check for the availability of resources before using them.
4. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
Line 83: The `create_and_associate_floatingip` function creates a floating IP address and associates it with a port, but it does not check if the port is still available when the floating IP address is created. It is recommended to check for the availability of resources before using them.
5. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
Line 94: The `addCleanup` function adds a cleanup function to delete a floating IP address, but it does not check if the cleanup function is still necessary when the test finishes. It is recommended to check for the necessity of cleanup functions before adding them.
6. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
Line 105: The `check_remote_connectivity` function compares the IP address of a server to the IP address of a floating IP address, but it does not check if the IP addresses are in the same subnet. It is recommended to check for the subnet of the IP addresses before comparing them.

To address these security defects, it is recommended to:

1. Restrict access to sensitive resources like keypairs to only authorized users or processes.
2. Check for dependencies on resources before deleting them.
3. Check for the availability of resources before using them.
4. Check for the necessity of cleanup functions before adding them.
5. Check for the subnet of IP addresses before comparing them.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
