 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and organization:

1. Consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type annotations: The code uses type hints for some variable definitions, but not for others. It's better to add type hints for all variable definitions to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings: The code has very few docstrings. It's helpful to add docstrings to functions and classes to explain their purpose and usage.
4. Function signature: Some functions have a large number of arguments. It's better to break down these functions into smaller functions with fewer arguments, making the code easier to read and maintain.
5. Consistent indentation: The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to ensure consistent indentation throughout the code.
6. Comments: The code has few comments. It's helpful to add comments to explain the purpose of the code, especially in places where the code is complex or hard to understand.
7. Error handling: The code has few error handling mechanisms. It's better to add proper error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected errors and exceptions.
8. Consistent spacing: The code has inconsistent spacing in some places. It's better to ensure consistent spacing throughout the code.

Overall, the code seems well-structured, and the author has made good use of Python's syntax and libraries. However, following the above suggestions can make the code more readable, maintainable, and efficient.
