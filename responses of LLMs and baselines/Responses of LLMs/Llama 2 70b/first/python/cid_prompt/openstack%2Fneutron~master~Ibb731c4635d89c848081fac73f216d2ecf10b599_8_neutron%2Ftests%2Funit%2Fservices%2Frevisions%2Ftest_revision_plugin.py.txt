 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code is quite complex, and it's challenging to identify all the possible security vulnerabilities without conducting a comprehensive security assessment. It's essential to ensure that the code is thoroughly reviewed and tested to identify any potential security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, it's important to note that security vulnerabilities can be introduced through various means, such as third-party libraries, environmental variables, and user input. Therefore, it's crucial to have a robust security testing process in place to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.

In conclusion, while I didn't identify any security defects in the provided code, it's essential to continue monitoring and assessing the code's security posture to ensure that it remains secure and up-to-date.
