 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses some deprecated options and features, such as the 'prevent_arp_spoofing' option, which is deprecated and will be removed in Ocata. It's recommended to remove this option and use the port security extension instead.

Additionally, the 'of_listen_address' and 'of_listen_port' options are only used for the 'native' driver, and they are not used in the current code. It's recommended to remove these options as they are not necessary.

Finally, the 'tunnel_csum' option is set to False by default, which means that the tunnel header checksum will not be set on outgoing IP packets carrying GRE/VXLAN tunnels. This may cause issues with some network configurations. It's recommended to set this option to True to ensure that the tunnel header checksum is set correctly.
