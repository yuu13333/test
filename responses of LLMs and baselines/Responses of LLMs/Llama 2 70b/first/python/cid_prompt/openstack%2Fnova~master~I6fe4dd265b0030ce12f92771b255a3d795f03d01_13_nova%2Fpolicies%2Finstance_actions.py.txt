 I have reviewed the code for security defects in accordance with the provided types, and I have found one potential security defect:

1. CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime

The `instance_actions_policies` list is defined and populated in the code, but it is not properly checked or validated before being returned by the `list_rules()` function. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the policy rules and gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

Solution:

To fix this issue, you should validate the `instance_actions_policies` list before returning it from the `list_rules()` function. You can do this by adding a check to ensure that all elements in the list are instances of the `policy.DocumentedRuleDefault` class, and that they all have a valid `name` attribute.

Additionally, you should consider adding a check to ensure that the `deprecated_rule` and `deprecated_reason` attributes of each policy are properly set, to prevent deprecated policies from being accidentally enforced.

Here's an example of how you could implement these checks:
```
def list_rules():
    valid_policies = []
    for policy in instance_actions_policies:
        if not isinstance(policy, policy.DocumentedRuleDefault):
            raise ValueError("Invalid policy type:", policy)
        if not policy.name:
            raise ValueError("Policy without name:", policy)
        valid_policies.append(policy)
    return valid_policies
```
This code iterates over the `instance_actions_policies` list, checks that each element is an instance of `policy.DocumentedRuleDefault`, and that it has a valid `name` attribute. If any invalid policies are found, a `ValueError` is raised. The valid policies are then appended to a new list, which is returned by the `list_rules()` function.

No other security defects were detected in the code.
