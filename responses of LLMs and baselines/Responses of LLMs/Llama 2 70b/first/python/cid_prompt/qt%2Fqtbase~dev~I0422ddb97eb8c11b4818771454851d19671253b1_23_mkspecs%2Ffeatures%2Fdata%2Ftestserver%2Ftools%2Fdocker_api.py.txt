 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings: Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. Adding docstrings would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused variables: The code defines several variables that are not used anywhere, such as `maintainer` and `update`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Complexity: Some functions, such as `docker_build` and `docker_run`, have a high level of complexity. It might be beneficial to break them down into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Error handling: The code uses `exit(-1)` to terminate the program when an error occurs. Instead, it's better to use specific error handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks or error codes, to handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
6. Security considerations: Although there are no security defects in the code, it's essential to keep in mind security best practices when working with Docker and other containerization technologies. For example, you should avoid using plaintext credentials, use secure communication protocols, and minimize the attack surface by running containers with minimal privileges.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and the author has made efforts to follow best practices. However, there is always room for improvement, and addressing these suggestions could enhance the code's quality and readability.
