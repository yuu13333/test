 I have reviewed the code and found a potential security defect. The defect is related to the 'Throttler' class, which is used to throttle the number of calls to a function to only once per 'threshold' seconds.

The issue is that the 'Throttler' class does not properly handle the case where multiple threads are trying to call the same function simultaneously. In particular, the 'is_deferred' attribute, which is used to track whether future calls should be deferred, is not properly synchronized across threads.

Here's an example of how this could lead to a security vulnerability:

Suppose that two threads, A and B, are trying to call the same function, 'function', simultaneously. If thread A has already exceeded the throttling threshold and has deferred its call, then thread B will also defer its call. However, if thread A then crashes or is interrupted before it has a chance to execute the deferred call, then thread B will never execute the call, even though it has already been deferred.

This could lead to a situation where a critical function, such as a security-related function, is not executed, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit a vulnerability.

To fix this issue, the 'Throttler' class should use a synchronized mechanism, such as a lock or a semaphore, to ensure that only one thread can defer a call at a time. Additionally, the class should also check whether a call has been deferred by another thread before deferring its own call.

Here's an example of how the 'Throttler' class could be modified to fix this issue:
```
class Throttler(object):
    def __init__(self, threshold=0):
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.last_time_called = time.time() - threshold
        self.mutex = threading.Lock()
        self.is_deferred = False

    def call(self, function, *args, **kwargs):
        with self.mutex:
            if self.is_deferred:
                return
            self.is_deferred = True
            time_since_last_call = (time.time() - self.last_time_called)
            if time_since_last_call < self.threshold:
                # We're in timeout, so we should throttle future calls.
                time_to_wait = self.threshold - time_since_last_call
                eventlet.sleep(time_to_wait)
            self.last_time_called = time.time()
            try:
                function(*args, **kwargs)
            finally:
                with self.mutex:
                    self.is_deferred = False
```
In this modified version of the 'Throttler' class, a lock is used to ensure that only one thread can defer a call at a time. Additionally, the class now checks whether a call has been deferred by another thread before deferring its own call.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
