 I have reviewed the code and found a security defect. The defect is related to improper access control (CWE-284).

The issue is that the `RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP`, `SUB_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP`, `ACTION_MAP`, and `ACTION_STATUS` variables are defined as empty dictionaries, but they are not properly validated or secured. An attacker could potentially manipulate these variables to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or perform malicious actions.

To fix this issue, it is recommended to validate and secure these variables by implementing proper access control mechanisms. For example, you could use a secure way to store and retrieve the attribute maps and action maps, such as using a secure database or encrypting the data. Additionally, you could implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to the attributes and actions based on user roles and permissions.

Here is an example of how you could implement secure access control for the attribute maps and action maps:
```
import json

# Load the attribute maps and action maps from a secure storage
with open('/path/to/secure/storage', 'r') as f:
    RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP = json.load(f)
    SUB_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP = json.load(f)
    ACTION_MAP = json.load(f)
    ACTION_STATUS = json.load(f)

# Implement access control for the attribute maps and action maps
def get_attribute_map(username):
    # Check if the user has access to the attribute map
    if not has_access(username, RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP):
        return None
    return RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP

def get_sub_resource_attribute_map(username):
    # Check if the user has access to the sub-resource attribute map
    if not has_access(username, SUB_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP):
        return None
    return SUB_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP

def get_action_map(username):
    # Check if the user has access to the action map
    if not has_access(username, ACTION_MAP):
        return None
    return ACTION_MAP

def get_action_status(username):
    # Check if the user has access to the action status
    if not has_access(username, ACTION_STATUS):
        return None
    return ACTION_STATUS

# Implement has_access function to check user permissions
def has_access(username, resource):
    # Check if the user has the required permissions
    # ...
    return True if user_has_permissions(username, resource) else False
```
In this example, the `get_attribute_map`, `get_sub_resource_attribute_map`, `get_action_map`, and `get_action_status` functions are used to secure access to the attribute maps and action maps. The `has_access` function is used to check if a user has access to a particular resource. The `user_has_permissions` function is where you would implement the logic to check the user's permissions, such as checking if the user is an administrator or has a specific role.

By implementing proper access control mechanisms, you can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and protect against potential security threats.
