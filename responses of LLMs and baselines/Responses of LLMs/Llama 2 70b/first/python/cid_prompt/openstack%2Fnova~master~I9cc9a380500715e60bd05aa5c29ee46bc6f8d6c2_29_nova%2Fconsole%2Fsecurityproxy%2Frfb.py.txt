 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Docstrings:
The code can benefit from adding docstrings to functions and classes to provide a brief explanation of what the function or class does.
4. Error handling:
The code can benefit from more robust error handling. For example, in the `connect` method, there are several places where an exception is raised without properly handling the error. It's better to catch the exception and handle it appropriately.
5. Code organization:
The code can benefit from better organization. For example, the `RFBSecurityProxy` class can be broken down into smaller methods each with a single responsibility. This will make the code easier to read and understand.
6. Comments:
The code can benefit from more descriptive comments. For example, the `connect` method has a long comment that explains what the method does, but it's not clear what the method does just by reading the name. It's better to provide a brief description of what the method does in the comment.
7. Constant naming:
The code uses constants that are not explicitly defined. It's better to define constants explicitly and use them throughout the code. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
8. Function signature:
The `connect` method takes two parameters, `tenant_sock` and `compute_sock`, but their types are not explicitly defined. It's better to define the types of the parameters explicitly.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and I don't see any glaring security issues. However, following best practices for code organization, naming conventions, and error handling can make the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
