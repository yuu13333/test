 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and consistency.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. It's helpful to include docstrings to make the code easier to understand and maintain.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports some modules that are not used, such as `http_cookies` and `six.moves.urllib.parse`. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid clutter and potential issues.
4. Unnecessary complexity:
The code has a complex structure with multiple inheritance and nested classes. While it's not necessarily a security issue, it can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Consider simplifying the code structure if possible.
5. Missing error handling:
The code has several places where errors are raised without proper handling. For example, in `NovaProxyRequestHandlerBase.verify_origin_proto`, a `ValidationError` is raised without any error handling. It's better to include proper error handling to ensure that the code can handle unexpected errors gracefully.
6. Hardcoded values:
The code has several hardcoded values, such as the `CONF.console.allowed_origins` list. It's better to define these values as constants or configuration options to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
7. Unused variables:
The code has some unused variables, such as `tsock` in `NovaProxyRequestHandlerBase.do_proxy`. It's better to remove unused variables to avoid confusion and potential issues.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, following best practices and addressing the above-mentioned issues can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and reliability.
