 I have reviewed the code and found a few potential security defects:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
In the `create_process` function, the `addl_env` parameter is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious environment variables that could lead to code execution or other security issues. It's recommended to sanitize the `addl_env` parameter using a secure method like `os.environ.copy()` or `dict.fromkeys()`.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
The `avoid_blocking_call` function uses `eventlet.getcurrent()` to check if the current thread is a greenlet. However, this check is not sufficient to ensure that the function is not called from a different thread or process. It's recommended to use a more robust method like `threading.currentThread()` or `multiprocessing.current_process()` to ensure that the function is called from the correct context.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
In the `execute` function, the `obj.stdin.close()` line is not properly protected. If an attacker were to call `execute` multiple times without properly closing the standard input stream, it could lead to resource leaks or other security issues. It's recommended to add a try-except block around the `obj.stdin.close()` line to ensure that it's properly closed in all cases.
4. CWE-691 (Incorrect Calculation):
In the `process_is_running` function, the `tasklist` command is used to check if a process is running. However, this command can be vulnerable to code injection attacks. It's recommended to use a safer method like `psutil` or `os.popen()` to check for running processes.
5. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
The `pid_invoked_with_cmdline` function does not properly check if the process is running as root. An attacker could potentially exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. It's recommended to add a check for the `run_as_root` parameter and ensure that the process is running with the correct privileges.

Overall, the code has some security vulnerabilities that should be addressed to prevent potential attacks. It's recommended to sanitize user input, use secure methods for interaction between multiple entities, properly control resources, and use safer methods for checking running processes.
