 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. Adding docstrings can improve code readability and help others understand the codebase more easily.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports some modules that are not used, such as 'eventlet' and 'timeutils'. It's better to remove unused imports to reduce clutter and minimize potential issues.
4. Unnecessary comments:
Some comments appear to be unnecessary or redundant, such as the comment for the ' AgentMixin' class, which is already clearly defined in the code. Removing unnecessary comments can make the code more concise and easier to read.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple classes and functions, but some functions are quite long and complex. Consider breaking down longer functions into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses Type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's better to use them consistently throughout the code to improve readability and catch potential type-related issues at compile-time.
7. Logging:
The code uses both 'logging' and 'LOG' for logging. It's better to stick to a single logging mechanism to avoid confusion and improve readability.
8. 'constants' module:
The code imports a 'constants' module but doesn't use it. It's better to remove the unused import and define the constants directly in the code or in a separate constants file.
9. 'utils' module:
The code imports a 'utils' module that is not used. It's better to remove the unused import to reduce clutter and minimize potential issues.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and I didn't detect any significant security issues. However, addressing the minor issues and suggestions mentioned above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality.
