 No security defects are discovered in the code.

However, I would like to point out that this code is quite complex, and it might be challenging to understand and maintain. It's a good idea to consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces, and adding comments to explain what each part does. Additionally, some of the variable names could be more descriptive, making the code easier to read and understand.
