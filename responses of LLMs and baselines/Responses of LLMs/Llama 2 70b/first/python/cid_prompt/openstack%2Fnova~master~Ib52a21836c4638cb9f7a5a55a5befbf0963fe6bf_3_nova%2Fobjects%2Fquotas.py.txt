 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters and return types. This will make the code easier to understand and help catch type-related errors early.
3. Docstrings:
Adding docstrings for functions and classes can help provide context and explain the purpose of the code. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
4. Function signature:
The `ids_from_instance` function takes a single argument, `instance`, but the function signature suggests it takes two arguments, `context` and `instance`. It's better to update the function signature to reflect the actual arguments passed.
5. Consistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. It's better to use consistent indentation to make the code easier to read.
6. Comments:
Adding comments to explain the purpose of the code can help make it easier to understand. For example, you can add comments to explain what the `ids_from_instance` function does and why it's needed.
7. Function logic:
The `check_deltas` function has a complex logic that can be hard to understand. It's better to break down the function into smaller functions each with a single responsibility, this will make the code easier to read and maintain.
8. Variable naming:
Some variable names are not descriptive, for example, `proj_values` and `user_values` can be renamed to something more descriptive like `project_values` and `user_values`.
9. Function naming:
The `limit_check_project_and_user` function name is a bit long, it can be renamed to something more concise and descriptive, for example, `check_project_and_user_limit`.
10. Code organization:
The code can benefit from being organized into smaller modules or classes each with a single responsibility. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.
