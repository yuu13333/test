 I have reviewed the code and found a potential security defect. The defect is related to the use of a temporary file for configuration, which could potentially lead to a vulnerability in the system.

The code creates a temporary file for configuration using the `tempfile` module, and then writes the configuration data to the file. However, the file is not properly cleaned up after use, which could lead to a situation where the file is not properly deleted, and its contents are accessible to unauthorized users.

To fix this issue, it is recommended to properly clean up the temporary file after use, for example, by using the `os.unlink` function to delete the file once it is no longer needed. Additionally, it would be a good practice to use a secure method for storing configuration data, such as using environment variables or a secure configuration database.

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to properly clean up the temporary file:
```
import os

# ...

self.conf = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+t')
self.conf.write(self._paste_config.lstrip())
self.conf.seek(0)
self.conf.flush()

# ...

def tearDown(self):
    self.conf.close()
    os.unlink(self.conf.name)
    super(WSGIAppTest, self).tearDown()
```
By adding the `os.unlink` call in the `tearDown` method, the temporary file will be properly deleted after use, reducing the risk of a security vulnerability.
