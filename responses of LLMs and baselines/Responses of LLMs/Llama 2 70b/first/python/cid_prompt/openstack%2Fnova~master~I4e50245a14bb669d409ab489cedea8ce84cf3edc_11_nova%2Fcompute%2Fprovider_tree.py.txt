 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the overall quality and reliability of the code:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to read and understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future. It's generally a good idea to stick to a single naming convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the functions and classes in the code do not have docstrings. Docstrings are important for providing context and information about the purpose and parameters of a function or class. Adding docstrings can help make the code more understandable and easier to use.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports the `logging` module, but it does not seem to be used anywhere. Unused imports can make the code harder to read and may introduce unnecessary dependencies. It's generally a good idea to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
4. Unnecessary comments:
Some of the comments in the code seem unnecessary or redundant. For example, the comment "No security defects are detected in the code" is not necessary, as it does not provide any additional information or context. Removing unnecessary comments can help make the code more concise and easier to read.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into separate functions and classes, which is good. However, some of the functions and classes are quite long, which can make the code harder to read and understand. Consider breaking up long functions and classes into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve readability and maintainability.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, addressing these minor issues can help improve the quality and readability of the code.
