 After analyzing the generated files, I did not find any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code uses the `cfg.CONF` module, which is not the recommended way to handle configuration files in Python. The `config` module is considered insecure and should be avoided. Instead, you can use the `configparser` module, which is a safer and more modern way to handle configuration files.

Additionally, the code uses the `open` function to read the configuration file, which can be vulnerable to path traversal attacks. It's recommended to use the `os.path.join` function to build the path to the configuration file, and to use the `with` statement to open the file, like this:
```python
with open(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'config.ini'), 'r') as f:
    cfg = configparser.ConfigParser()
    cfg.read_file(f)
```
This code is more secure and harder to exploit.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, it's important to be mindful of the security implications of the libraries and functions used, and to keep up-to-date with best practices for securing Python applications.
