 After analyzing the generated files, I did not find any security defects in the code. The code seems to be well-structured and secure. However, I did notice a few potential improvements that could enhance the security of the code:

1. Input validation:
In the `NovaProxyRequestHandler` class, the `parse_request` method takes a `request` object as an argument, which is not validated. It's possible to pass a malicious request object that could lead to unexpected behavior. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to validate the request object before processing it.
