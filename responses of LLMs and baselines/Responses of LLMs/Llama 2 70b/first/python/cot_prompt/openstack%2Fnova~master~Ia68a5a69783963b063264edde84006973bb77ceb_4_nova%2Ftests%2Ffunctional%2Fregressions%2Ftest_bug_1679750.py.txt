 After analyzing the generated code, I have found a potential security defect in the `test_local_delete_allocation_cleanup.py` file.

The security defect is related to the use of raw SQL queries in the `test_local_delete_allocation_cleanup` function. Specifically, the code uses a raw SQL query to retrieve the allocations for a given resource provider, which can potentially lead to SQL injection attacks.

Here's the relevant code snippet:
```python
def test_local_delete_allocation_cleanup(self):
    # ...
    allocations = self.placement_api.get('/resource_providers/%(uuid)s/usages' % {'uuid': rp_uuid})
    # ...
```
The use of raw SQL queries can allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of data. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to use parameterized queries instead.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to use a parameterized query:
```python
def test_local_delete_allocation_cleanup(self):
    # ...
    allocations = self.placement_api.get('/resource_providers/%(uuid)s/usages', params={'uuid': rp_uuid})
    # ...
```
By using a parameterized query, we can avoid the risk of SQL injection attacks and ensure that the code is more secure.

Therefore, the security defect detected in the code is:

* Raw SQL queries are used in the `test_local_delete_allocation_cleanup` function, which can potentially lead to SQL injection attacks.

The solution is to modify the code to use parameterized queries instead of raw SQL queries.

No other security defects were detected in the code.
