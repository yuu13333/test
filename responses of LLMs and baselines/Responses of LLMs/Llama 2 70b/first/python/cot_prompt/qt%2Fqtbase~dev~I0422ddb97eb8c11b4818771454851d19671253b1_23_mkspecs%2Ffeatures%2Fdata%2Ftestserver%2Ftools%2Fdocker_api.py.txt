 Upon analyzing the generated files, I did not detect any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code uses the `docker run` command with the `-d` flag, which runs the container in detached mode. This means that the container's standard input, output, and error streams are not connected to the host's console. While this is not a security defect, it's worth noting that using detached mode can make it more difficult to monitor the container's activity and respond to any issues that may arise.

Additionally, the code uses the `docker exec` command to run a script inside the container. While this is a legitimate use case, it's worth noting that the `docker exec` command can also be used to execute arbitrary commands inside the container. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the script being executed is trusted and does not contain any malicious code.

Lastly, the code uses the `check_call` function from the `subprocess` module to run the `docker` commands. While this is a convenient way to run commands, it's worth noting that the `check_call` function does not perform any input validation on the command arguments. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the input arguments are properly validated before passing them to the `check_call` function.

In summary, while I did not detect any security defects in the code, it's important to be mindful of the potential risks associated with using detached mode, executing scripts inside containers, and
