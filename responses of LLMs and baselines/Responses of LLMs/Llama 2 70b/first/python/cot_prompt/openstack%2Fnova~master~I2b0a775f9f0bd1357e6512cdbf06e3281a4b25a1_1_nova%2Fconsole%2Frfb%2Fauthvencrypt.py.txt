 After analyzing the generated code, I did not detect any security defects. The code appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for secure coding. The use of SSL/TLS encryption for secure VNC access is a good security measure, and the code properly handles the establishment of the encryption connection.

The code also properly checks for errors and exceptions during the handshake process and logs relevant information to the console. Additionally, the code uses secure coding practices, such as using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Overall, the code appears to be secure, and I did not detect any security defects.
