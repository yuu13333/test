 After analyzing the generated code, I have found a potential security defect in the `PortForwarding` class.

The defect is related to the `obj_load_attr` method, which is used to load attributes from the Floating IP object. The method uses the `getattr` function to retrieve the value of the `floating_ip_address` or `router_id` attribute from the Floating IP object, but it does not check if the attribute exists before accessing it. This can lead to a `TypeError` if the attribute does not exist, and it can also allow an attacker to manipulate the `floating_ip_address` or `router_id` attribute of a Port Forwarding object.

Here is the line number of the code where the defect is found:
```
76     def _load_attr_from_fip(self, attrname):
77         # get all necessary info from fip obj
78         fip_obj = self._get_fip_obj()
79         value = getattr(fip_obj, attrname)
80         setattr(self, attrname, value)
81         self.obj_reset_changes([attrname])
```
To fix this defect, we can add a check to ensure that the attribute exists before trying to access it. Here is a possible solution:
```
76     def _load_attr_from_fip(self, attrname):
77         # get all necessary info from fip obj
78         fip_obj = self._get_fip_obj()
79         if hasattr(fip_obj, attrname):
80         value = getattr(fip_obj, attrname)
81         setattr(self, attrname, value)
82         self.obj_reset_changes([attrname])
```
By adding the `hasattr` check, we ensure that the attribute exists before trying to access it, which prevents the `TypeError` and also prevents an attacker from manipulating the attribute.

Therefore, the fixed code with the security defect fixed is:
```
76     def _load_attr_from_fip(self, attrname):
77         # get all necessary info from fip obj
78         fip_obj = self._get_fip_obj()
79         if hasattr(fip_obj, attrname):
80         value = getattr(fip_obj, attrname)
81         setattr(self, attrname, value)
82         self.obj_reset_changes([attrname])
```
No other security defects were detected in the code.
