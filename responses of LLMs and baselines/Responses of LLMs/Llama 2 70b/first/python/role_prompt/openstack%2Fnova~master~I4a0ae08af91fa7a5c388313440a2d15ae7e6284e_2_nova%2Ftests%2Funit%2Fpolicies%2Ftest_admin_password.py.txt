 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
In line 14, the import statement for `uuidsentinel` is missing a dot (`.`). It should be `from oslo_utils import uuidsentinel as uuids`.
2. Type hints for function parameters:
In line 59, the function parameter `mock_password` does not have a type hint. It should be annotated with the type of the mock object, e.g. `mock.Mock`.
3. docstrings:
The docstrings for the classes and functions are not very descriptive. It would be helpful to include a brief description of what the class or function does, what the purpose of the test is, and what the expected behavior is.
4. Test organization:
The tests are organized in a strange way. It would be better to have a separate test class for each test, rather than having multiple test classes in the same file. This would make the code easier to read and understand.
5. Test naming:
The test names are not very descriptive. It would be better to use more descriptive names that indicate what the test is testing, e.g. `test_admin_password_policy_for_authorized_users` instead of `test_change_paassword_policy`.
6. Code organization:
The code is not very well organized. It would be better to break the code into smaller, more manageable sections, and use descriptive variable names to make the code easier to read and understand.
7. Missing `self` in `setUp` method:
In line 34, the `setUp` method is missing a `self` parameter. It should be `def setUp(self):`.
8. Unused variable:
In line 45, the variable `self.mock_get` is not used anywhere in the code. It should be removed.
9. Missing `return` statement:
In line 65, the `common_policy_check` function is missing a `return` statement. It should be `return self.common_policy_check(....)`.
10. Redundant `self` parameter:
In line 69, the `AdminPasswordScopeTypePolicyTest` class has a redundant `self` parameter in the `setUp` method. It should be removed.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, but there are a few improvements that could be made to make it more readable, maintainable, and secure.
