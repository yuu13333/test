 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use separate words with underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Error handling:
The code uses try-except blocks to handle errors, but it's not always clear what errors are being caught and how they're being handled. It's better to catch specific errors and handle them appropriately, rather than catching a general "Exception" and hoping that the error message will be helpful.
3. Variable naming:
Some variable names are not descriptive or follow a consistent naming convention. For example, "server_list" could be renamed to "servers" or "server_configs" to make it clearer what the variable represents.
4. Function documentation:
The functions lack clear documentation. It's helpful to include docstrings that describe the purpose of the function, its parameters, return value, and any other relevant information. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
5. Indentation:
The indentation is inconsistent in some places. For example, in the "docker_build" function, the "for server in server_list:" loop has inconsistent indentation. It's better to use consistent indentation to make the code easier to read.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to manage and maintain. It's better to break the code into smaller files or modules, each with its own clear purpose and responsibilities. This makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
7. Environment variables:
The code uses environment variables for configuration, which can be problematic if the environment variables are not set or are set incorrectly. It's better to use configuration files or command-line arguments to configure the application, rather than relying on environment variables.
8. Docker version checking:
The "docker_version" function is not necessary, as the Docker version is already being checked by the "check_call" function in the "docker_build" function. It's better to remove the unnecessary function to simplify the code.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and the author has made good use of Python's syntax and built-in functions. However, there are some areas where the code could be improved for readability, maintainability, and security.
