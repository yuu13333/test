 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function signatures could benefit from type hints and annotations. For example, in the `ids_from_instance` function, the return type could be specified as `Tuple[str, str]`.
3. Docstrings:
Some of the functions lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions, even if they are trivial.
4. Function signature consistency:
The function signatures in the `Quotas` class are not consistent. Some functions take a `context` argument, while others don't. It's better to make the function signatures consistent throughout the class.
5. Unused imports:
The code imports `quota.QUOTAS` but doesn't use it anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
6. Unused variables:
The `project_id` and `user_id` variables in the `ids_from_instance` function are not used anywhere. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion.
7. Simplify `check_deltas` function:
The `check_deltas` function is quite complex and does a lot of repetitive work. It could be simplified by extracting the common logic into a separate function and using it accordingly.
8. Use `oslo_log` instead of `print`:
The code uses `print` statements for logging. It's better to use the `oslo_log` module instead, which provides a more structured and configurable logging mechanism.
9. Use constants for magic numbers:
The code uses magic numbers in some places, such as `1.3` in the `VERSION` constant. It's better to define constants for these values to make the code more readable and maintainable.
