 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that may improve the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can make the code more readable and easier to understand, and can also help catch type-related errors.
3. docstrings:
Some functions lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and any exceptions they may raise. Adding docstrings can make the code more understandable and easier to use.
4. Consistent indentation:
The indentation of the code is not consistent. Some lines are indented with four spaces, while others are indented with eight spaces. It's better to use a consistent indentation throughout the code.
5. Utilize constants:
The code uses hardcoded strings and values in several places. It's better to define constants for these values and use them throughout the code, making it easier to change them if necessary.
6. Function signature:
The `mount_volume` function takes a `configfile` parameter, but it's not used anywhere in the function. It's better to remove this parameter or use it consistently throughout the function.
7. Error handling:
The code catches `ProcessExecutionError` exceptions but doesn't handle them consistently. It's better to handle these exceptions appropriately, providing meaningful error messages and taking appropriate actions.
8. Code organization:
The code is organized into separate functions, but some functions are quite long and complex. It's better to break down these functions into smaller, more manageable functions, making the code easier to read and maintain.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and no security defects are detected. However, addressing the minor issues mentioned above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality.
