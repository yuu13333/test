 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have a few suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent coding style:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function definitions lack type hints and annotations for the input and output parameters. Adding these can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
3. docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for the functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can improve code readability and help others understand the code better.
4. Error handling:
The code raises bare exceptions (e.g., `exc.HTTPConflict`, `exc.HTTPBadRequest`) without providing any context or error messages. It's better to provide specific error messages and context to help the user understand what went wrong and how to fix it.
5. Consistent indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation in some places, such as line 51. It's better to use consistent indentation to improve code readability.
6. Function naming:
The functions `extract_password` and `convert_password` are not very descriptive. Consider renaming them to something more descriptive, such as `get_password` and `encode_password`.
7. Variable naming:
The variable `CHUNKS` is not very descriptive. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `PASSWORD_CHUNK_SIZE`.
8. Redundant imports:
The code imports `six` and `webob` twice. It's better to remove the redundant imports to avoid confusion and improve code readability.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to understand. With a few improvements, it can be even better.
