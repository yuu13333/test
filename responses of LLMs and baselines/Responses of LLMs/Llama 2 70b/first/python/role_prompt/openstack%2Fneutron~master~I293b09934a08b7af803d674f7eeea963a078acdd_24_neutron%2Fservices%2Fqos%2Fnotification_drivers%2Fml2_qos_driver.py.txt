 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable and function names.
2. Type annotations:
The code uses type hints for function parameters and return types, which is great. However, it's missing type annotations for variable declarations. Adding type annotations for variables will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Docstrings:
The code has docstrings for classes, functions, and methods, but they are not consistently formatted. It's better to follow a consistent format for docstrings, such as using triple quotes and including a brief description, parameters, return type, and any other relevant information.
4. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are shorter and less descriptive. It's better to use descriptive names for all functions, even if they are longer. For example, instead of `_validate_port_rules_supported`, you can use `validate_port_rules_supported`.
5. Function logic:
The logic in some functions, such as `_validate_port_rules_supported`, seems complex and difficult to follow. It's better to break down the logic into smaller, more manageable pieces and use descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand.
6. Comments:
The code has some comments, but they are not consistently formatted. It's better to use consistent formatting for comments, such as using triple quotes and including a brief description of the code section.
7. Consistent indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read.

Overall, the code seems well-structured, and the use of type hints and docstrings is appreciated. However, following consistent naming conventions, adding type annotations for variables, and improving function naming and logic will make the code more readable and maintainable.
