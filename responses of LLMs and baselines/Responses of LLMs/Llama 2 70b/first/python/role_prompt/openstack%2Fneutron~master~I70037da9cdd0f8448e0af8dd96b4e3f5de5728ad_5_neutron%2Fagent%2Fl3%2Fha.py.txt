 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and organization:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations sparingly. Adding more type hints and annotations can make the code easier to read and understand, and help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are shorter and less descriptive. It's better to use descriptive names for all functions to make the code easier to understand.
4. Function documentation:
The code has very little documentation. Adding docstrings to functions and classes can help explain their purpose and behavior, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into several classes and functions, but it's not immediately clear how they relate to each other. Consider reorganizing the code into clearer sections or modules, and use descriptive names for classes, functions, and variables to help the reader understand the code's structure and flow.
6. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Adding comments can help explain the code's behavior, especially in complex sections. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
7. Consistent indentation:
The code's indentation is generally consistent, but there are a few places where it's incons
