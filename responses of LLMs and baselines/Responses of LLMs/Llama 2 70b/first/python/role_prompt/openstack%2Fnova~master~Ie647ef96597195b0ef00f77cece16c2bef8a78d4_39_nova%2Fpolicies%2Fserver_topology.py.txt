 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The docstrings in the code are not consistent. Some functions have docstrings, while others don't. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions, even if they are trivial.
3. Trailing commas:
The code has trailing commas in some lists, such as line 20 and 31. While this is not a security issue, it's a good practice to avoid trailing commas to make the code more readable.
4. Indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines have four spaces, while others have eight. It's better to stick to a single indentation size throughout the code.
5. Comments:
The code has some comments that are not necessary, such as the comment on line 14. It's a good practice to remove unnecessary comments to make the code more readable.
6. Function naming:
The function `list_rules()` could be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `get_server_topology_policies()`.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand. Good job!
