 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
In the code, some variable and function names use camelCase convention, while others use snake_case. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
Some function parameters and return types are not annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can make the code more readable and easier to understand, and can also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can help provide context and make the code more understandable.
4. Deprecated options:
The code contains some deprecated options, such as `prevent_arp_spoofing` and `agent_type`. It's recommended to remove these options and replace them with new options that provide the same functionality, if necessary.
5. Unused variables and imports:
The code contains some unused variables and imports. It's recommended to remove them to simplify the code and reduce clutter.
6. Consistency in spacing and indentation:
The code has inconsistent spacing and indentation in some places. It's better to maintain consistent spacing and indentation throughout the code for readability and ease of maintenance.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand. Following best practices and consistency in naming conventions, type hints, docstrings, and spacing can make the code more maintainable and readable.
