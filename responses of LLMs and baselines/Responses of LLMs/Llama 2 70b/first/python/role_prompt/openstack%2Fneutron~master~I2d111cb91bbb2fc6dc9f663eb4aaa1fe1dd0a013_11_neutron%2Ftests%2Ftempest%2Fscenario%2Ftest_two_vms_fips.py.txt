 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few best practices that could be improved:

1. Consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints: The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated with type hints. Adding type hints can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. docstrings: The code does not include docstrings for the functions, which can make it difficult to understand the purpose and parameters of the functions. Adding docstrings can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
4. Consistent indentation: The indentation in the code is not consistent, with some lines having more spaces than others. It's better to use consistent indentation to make the code easier to read.
5. Function signature: The function signature in line 65 is quite long and complex. It's better to break down the function into smaller functions each with a single responsibility, this will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
6. Inconsistent variable naming: The code uses both lowercase and uppercase variable names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
7. Missing constants: The code uses hardcoded values for the number of servers, flavor ref, image ref, and other parameters. It's better to define these values as constants at the top of the file, this will make the code more readable and easier to change.
8. Unused variables: The code defines some variables that are not used, such as `CONF.validation.image_ssh_user` in line 91. It's better to remove unused variables to avoid confusion and make the code more readable.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to follow. However, following best practices and adding more comments to the code can make it more readable and maintainable.
