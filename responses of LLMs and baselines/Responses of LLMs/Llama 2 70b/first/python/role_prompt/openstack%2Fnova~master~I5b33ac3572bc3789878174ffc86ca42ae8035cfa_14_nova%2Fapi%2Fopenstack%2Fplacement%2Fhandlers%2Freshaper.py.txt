 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not annotated. Adding type hints and annotations will make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for the functions, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and parameters of the functions. Adding docstrings will improve the code's readability and help developers understand the code better.
4. Error handling:
The code catches generic exceptions like `Exception` and `InvalidInventory`, but it's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately. This will make the error handling more robust and informative.
5. Consolidate similar code:
The code has similar logic for handling inventory and allocations. It's better to consolidate this logic into separate functions or methods to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
6. Use constants for magic numbers:
The code uses magic numbers like `1.30` and `204` without explaining their significance. It's better to define constants for these values to make the code more readable and maintainable.
7. Use a consistent coding style:
The code uses both tabs and spaces for indentation, which can make the code look inconsistent. It's better to stick to a single indentation style throughout the code.
8. Consider using a context manager:
The code uses a bare `try`-`except` block to handle exceptions, which can make the code look messy. Consider using a context manager to handle the exceptions more elegantly.
9. Consider using a separate function for reshaping:
The `reshape` function is quite long and complex. Consider breaking it down into smaller functions each with a single responsibility to improve the code's readability and maintainability.
10. Add tests:
The code lacks tests, which makes it difficult to ensure that the code works correctly. Add tests to ensure that the code functions correctly and to catch any potential bugs.
