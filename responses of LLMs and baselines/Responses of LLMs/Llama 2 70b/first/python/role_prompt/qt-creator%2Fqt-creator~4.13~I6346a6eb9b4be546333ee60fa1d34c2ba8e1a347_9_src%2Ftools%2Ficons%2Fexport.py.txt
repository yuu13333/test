 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Comments: The code has very few comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of each function, variable, and block of code will make it easier for others to understand and maintain the code.
3. Error handling: The code doesn't handle errors well. For example, if the `inkscape` or `optipng` command is not found in the PATH, the code will exit without warning. It's better to handle such errors gracefully and provide clear error messages.
4. Security: The code uses `subprocess.run` to execute the `inkscape` and `optipng` commands. This can be a security risk if the input files contain malicious content. It's better to use a safer method, such as `subprocess.check_output`, to execute the commands.
5. Code organization: The code is organized in a linear fashion, with each function following the other. It's better to group related functions together and use a more modular approach to code organization.
6. Function naming: Some function names are not very descriptive, such as `exportPngs` and `optimizePngs`. It's better to use more descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the function.
7. Variable naming: Some variable names are not very descriptive, such as `svgIDs` and `scaleFactors`. It's better to use more descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the variable.
8. Unused variables: The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `scriptDir` and `svgTree`. It's better to remove unused variables to reduce code clutter.
9. Code style: The code uses both tabs and spaces for indentation. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
10. Testing: The code doesn't include any tests. It's better to add tests to ensure that the code works correctly and to catch any bugs early.
