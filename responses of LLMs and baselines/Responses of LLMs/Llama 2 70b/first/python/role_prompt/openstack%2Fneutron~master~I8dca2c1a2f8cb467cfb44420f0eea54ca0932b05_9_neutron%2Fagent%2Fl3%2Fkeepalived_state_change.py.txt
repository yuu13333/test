 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the functionality of the code:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this is not a security issue, it can make the code harder to read and understand. It's generally a good idea to stick to a single naming convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings: Some of the functions and classes in the code do not have docstrings. Docstrings can help provide context and explanations for the purpose and behavior of the code, which can make it easier for others to understand and maintain. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions and classes.
3. Unused imports: The code imports some modules that are not used anywhere, such as `httplib2` and `six.moves`. While this is not a security issue, it can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It's generally a good idea to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and tidy.
4. Unused variables: The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `LOG`. While this is not a security issue, it can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It's generally a good idea to remove unused variables to keep the code clean and tidy.
5. Missing error handling: The code does not handle errors for some functions, such as `send_garp` and `write_state_change`. While this is not a security issue, it can make the code less robust and more prone to failures. It's generally a good idea to include error handling for all functions to ensure that the code can handle unexpected errors and exceptions gracefully.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, there are some areas where the code could be improved for better readability, maintainability, and robustness.
