 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have a few suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
In line 14, `ALIAS` is defined with capital letters, while in line 19, `IS_SHIM_EXTENSION` and `IS_STANDARD_ATTR_EXTENSION` are defined with lowercase letters. It's better to maintain consistent naming conventions throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks documentation for some variables and functions. It's a good practice to add docstrings for variables and functions that describe their purpose and usage. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.
3. Unused variables:
The code defines `UPDATED_TIMESTAMP` in line 35, but it doesn't seem to be used anywhere. It's better to remove unused variables to avoid confusion and keep the code clean.
4. Inconsistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is inconsistent. Some lines have four spaces, while others have eight. It's better to maintain consistent indentation throughout the code.
5. Missing `default` branch:
The code doesn't have a `default` branch in the `ACTION_MAP` and `ACTION_STATUS` dictionaries. It's a good practice to include a `default` branch to handle cases where no specific action or status is defined.
6. Missing type hints:
The code doesn't include type hints for some variables and functions. It's a good practice to include type hints to make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and secure. However, following best practices and addressing the above suggestions will make the code more maintainable and easier to understand for other developers.
