 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
In line 30, the variable `os` is used, which is not consistent with the naming conventions used throughout the rest of the code. It would be better to use `osutils` or `os.name` to make the code more readable.
2. Type hints for function arguments:
In line 46, the function `execute` is defined without type hints for its arguments. It would be better to add type hints for `function`, `args`, and `kwargs` to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Consistent spacing:
There are inconsistent spaces between lines in the code, which can make it harder to read. It would be better to add consistent spacing between lines to make the code more readable.
4. Unused imports:
The imports `timeutils` and `utils` are not used in the code. It would be better to remove them to avoid unnecessary clutter.
5. Unnecessary comments:
Some comments in the code, such as the one in line 41, are not necessary and can be removed. It's better to focus on writing clear and concise code that speaks for itself, rather than relying on comments to explain what the code does.
6. Function naming conventions:
The function naming conventions in the code are not consistent. Some functions have a verb-noun naming convention (e.g., `load_interface_driver`), while others have a noun-verb convention (e.g., `Throttler`). It would be better to use consistent naming conventions throughout the code.
7. docstrings:
It would be helpful to include docstrings for functions and classes to provide information about their purpose, parameters, return types, and any other relevant details. This would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
