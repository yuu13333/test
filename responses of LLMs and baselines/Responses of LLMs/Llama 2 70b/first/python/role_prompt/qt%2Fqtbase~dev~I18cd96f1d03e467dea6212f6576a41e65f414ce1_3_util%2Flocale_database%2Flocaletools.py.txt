 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured, and the security vulnerabilities that could be present in the code, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS), are not apparent. The code is primarily focused on file manipulation and string processing, which are not typically associated with security risks.

The code does use the `open` function to read and write files, which could potentially lead to security issues if used with untrusted input. However, the code only opens files that are specified by the user, and it does not appear to use any user-supplied input to construct file paths or names. Therefore, the risk of security vulnerabilities due to file manipulation appears to be low.

The code also uses the `ExitStack` context manager to manage resources, which is a good practice to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up after use.

Overall, based on the provided code, it does not appear to contain any significant security defects. However, it is always important to keep in mind that security vulnerabilities can be introduced in any code, and a comprehensive security assessment should be performed to identify any potential issues.
