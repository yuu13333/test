 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for variable and function names, and snake_case for parameter names.
2. Docstrings:
The code has docstrings for some of the functions and variables, but not for all. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions and variables, so that the code is self-explanatory and easy to understand.
3. Type hints:
The code uses type hints for some of the variables and functions, but not for all. It's a good practice to include type hints for all variables and functions, so that the code is more readable and maintainable.
4. Consistency in indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to maintain consistent indentation throughout the code, so that it's easier to read and understand.
5. Deprecated rules:
The code has a deprecated rule, but it's not clear why it's deprecated or when it will be removed. It's a good practice to include a clear explanation of why a rule is deprecated and when it will be removed, so that users understand the impact of using the deprecated rule.
6. Missing constants:
The code uses some constants, such as `base.RULE_ADMIN_OR_OWNER`, but they are not defined in the code. It's better to define all constants at the top of the file, so that they are easily accessible and understandable.
7. Consistency in error messages:
The code has different error messages for different scenarios. It's better to use consistent error messages throughout the code, so that users understand the impact of their actions.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand. However, following these best practices can make the code more maintainable, readable, and secure.
