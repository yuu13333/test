 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code for better readability and maintainability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand, and also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The code can benefit from adding docstrings to functions and classes to provide a brief description of what the function or class does, its purpose, and any other relevant information.
4. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have inconsistent signature formats. For example, some functions have a space between the function name and the opening parenthesis, while others do not. It's better to be consistent with the signature format throughout the code.
5. Redundant imports:
The code has redundant imports, such as `import six`. It's better to remove these redundant imports to reduce clutter and improve code readability.
6. Unused variables:
The code has unused variables, such as `CONF` and `LOG`. It's better to remove these unused variables or use them appropriately in the code.
7. Consistent exception handling:
The code can benefit from consistent exception handling. For example, some functions catch and raise specific exceptions, while others raise a general `Exception`. It's better to catch and raise specific exceptions consistently throughout the code.
8. Code organization:
The code can benefit from better organization. For example, the `RFBSecurityProxy` class can be broken down into smaller functions or methods, each with a single responsibility. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, and I don't detect any security defects. However, following these best practices can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality.
