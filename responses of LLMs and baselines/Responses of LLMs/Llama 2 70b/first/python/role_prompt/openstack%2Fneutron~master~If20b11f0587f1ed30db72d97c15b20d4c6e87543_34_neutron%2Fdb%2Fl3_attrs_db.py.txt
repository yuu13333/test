 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, `get_attr_info` could be renamed to `get_attribute_info`.
2. Type hints for function arguments and return types:
It's a good practice to include type hints for function arguments and return types. For example, in the `get_attr_info` function, the return type could be specified as `dict[str, dict[str, str]]`.
3. Docstrings:
It's helpful to include docstrings for functions and classes to provide a brief explanation of their purpose and usage.
4. Separation of concerns:
The `ExtraAttributesMixin` class seems to have two distinct responsibilities:
* Enabling router's extra attributes
* Ensuring the existence of the `RouterExtraAttributes` model
It might be better to separate these concerns into two separate classes or methods.
5. Consistency in indentation:
The indentation in the code is inconsistent. It's better to maintain a consistent indentation throughout the code.
6. Use of `lambda` functions:
The use of `lambda` functions in the `get_attr_info` function could make the code harder to read and understand. It might be better to define separate functions for each calculation instead of using `lambda` functions.
7. Use of `context.session.add()`:
The use of `context.session.add()` in the `_ensure_extra_attr_model` method could lead to unexpected behavior if the session is not properly closed. It's better to use `context.session.begin()` instead to ensure that the changes are properly committed.
8. Use of `subtransactions=True`:
The use of `subtransactions=True` in the `set_extra_attr_value` method could lead to unexpected behavior if the transaction is not properly rolled back. It's better to use `context.session.begin()` instead to ensure that the changes are properly committed.
9. Missing `try...except` block:
The `set_extra_attr_value` method does not handle any exceptions that might occur during the update process. It's better to include a `try...except` block to handle any potential exceptions.
10. Use of `Registry.notify()`:
The use of `Registry.notify()` in the `set_extra_attr_value` method could lead to unexpected behavior if the notification is not properly handled. It's better to use a more explicit mechanism for notifying the appropriate handlers.
