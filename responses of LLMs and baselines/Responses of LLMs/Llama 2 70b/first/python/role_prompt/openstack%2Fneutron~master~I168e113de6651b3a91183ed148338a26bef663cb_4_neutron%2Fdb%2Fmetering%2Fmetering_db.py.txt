 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and consistency.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations will make the code more readable and easier to understand, and will also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings will improve the code's readability and help developers understand how to use the functions correctly.
4. Function signature:
The function signature for `get_sync_data_metering` is inconsistent. The function takes two arguments, `context` and `label_id`, but the latter is optional. It's better to define a default value for `label_id` or remove it altogether if it's not necessary.
5. Consistent indentation:
The code uses inconsistent indentation, which can make it difficult to read and understand. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code to improve readability.
6. Comments:
The code lacks comments in some places, which makes it difficult to understand what the code does. Adding comments will improve the code's readability and help developers understand what the code does and how it works.
7. Error handling:
The code catches `DBReferenceError` and wraps it in a custom `MeteringLabelNotFound` exception. However, it's not clear why this is done, and it's not consistent with the rest of the code. It's better to let the exception propagate and handle it at a higher level, or provide a clear explanation of why it's being caught and wrapped.
8. Consistent exception handling:
The code catches and handles various exceptions, but the exception handling is not consistent. It's better to handle exceptions consistently throughout the code and provide clear error messages and logging.
9. Logging:
The code does not log errors or exceptions properly. It's better to add logging statements to capture errors and exceptions, especially in critical sections of the code.
10. Code organization:
The code is organized
