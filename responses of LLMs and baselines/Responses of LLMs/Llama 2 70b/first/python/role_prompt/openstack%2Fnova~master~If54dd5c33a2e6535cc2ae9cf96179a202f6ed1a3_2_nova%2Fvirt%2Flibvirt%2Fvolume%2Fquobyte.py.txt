 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's functionality or performance:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to read and understand. It's generally a good idea to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the codebase.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and variables lack docstrings that describe their purpose and usage. Docstrings can help other developers understand the code and make it easier to maintain. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions and variables.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports the `six` module, but it doesn't seem to be used anywhere. Unused imports can make the code harder to read and may introduce unnecessary dependencies. It's a good idea to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and simple.
4. Unnecessary complexity:
The `is_systemd()` function seems to be overly complex. It checks if the host is running systemd, but it does so by executing a command that may not be necessary in all cases. Instead, the function could simply check if the `systemd` executable exists or if the `systemctl` command is available. This would make the code simpler and more efficient.
5. Redundant code:
The `connect_volume()` and `disconnect_volume()` functions have similar code paths that seem to duplicate functionality. It may be possible to merge these functions into a single function that handles both connection and disconnection. This would simplify the code and reduce the risk of bugs.

Again, these are not security defects, but rather suggestions for improving the code's readability, maintainability, and performance.
