 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, and return values. Adding docstrings would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports `timeutils` but doesn't use it anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and avoid potential conflicts.
4. Recursive import:
The code imports `cfg` which results in a recursive import. This can be avoided by using the actual config value instead of importing the module.
5. Use of `time.time()`:
The code uses `time.time()` to measure time intervals, but it's not the best choice for precision. Consider using `time.perf_counter()` or `time.process_time()` instead, depending on the specific use case.
6. Use of `eventlet.sleep()`:
The code uses `eventlet.sleep()` to introduce a delay, but it's not the best choice for precision. Consider using `time.sleep()` instead, which provides finer-grained control over sleep intervals.
7. Use of `SystemExit`:
The code raises `SystemExit(1)` to indicate a fatal error, but it's not the best choice for error handling. Consider using a more specific exception type, such as `RuntimeError`, to indicate the error and provide more information about the cause of the error.
8. Use of `functools.partial()`:
The code uses `functools.partial()` to create a partial function, but it's not the best choice for this use case. Consider using a lambda function instead, which is more concise and easier to read.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. These suggestions are minor and do not affect the security of the code.
