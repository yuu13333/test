 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not annotated. Adding type hints and annotations will make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for the functions, classes, and variables. Adding docstrings will help in understanding the purpose and usage of the code.
4. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly. It's better to handle errors and exceptions explicitly and provide meaningful error messages.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file. It's better to break the code into smaller modules and files for easier maintenance and readability.
6. Testing:
The code has a good set of tests, but it's always a good idea to add more tests to cover different scenarios and edge cases.
7. Security:
The code deals with network traffic and manipulation. It's important to ensure that the code is secure and doesn't allow any potential security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or SQL injection.
8. Code style:
The code indentation and formatting are not consistent. It's better to follow a consistent coding style throughout the code.

Overall, the code looks clean and well-structured, but there is always room for improvement in terms of security, readability, and maintainability.
