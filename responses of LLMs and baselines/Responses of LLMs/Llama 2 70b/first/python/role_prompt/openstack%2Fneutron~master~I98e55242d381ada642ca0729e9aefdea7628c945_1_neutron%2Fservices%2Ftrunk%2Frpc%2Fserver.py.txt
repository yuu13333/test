 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code easier to read and understand, and also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Function docstrings:
Some functions lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and behavior. Adding docstrings will make the code more readable and help others understand its functionality.
4. Consistent indentation and spacing:
The code has inconsistent indentation and spacing, which can make it harder to read. It's better to use consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code.
5. Comments and logging:
The code has minimal comments and logging statements. Adding comments and logging statements can help explain the code's behavior, making it easier to understand and debug.
6. Function signature and naming:
Some functions have lengthy signatures and names, which can make them hard to read and understand. Consider breaking down these functions into smaller functions with simpler signatures and names.
7. Class inheritance and organization:
The code has a complex inheritance hierarchy, which can make it difficult to understand. Consider reorganizing the classes and inheritance hierarchy to make it more straightforward and easier to comprehend.
8. Constant naming:
Some constant names are not descriptive or follow a consistent naming convention. Consider using more descriptive names for constants, and following a consistent naming convention throughout the code.
9. Unused imports and variables:
The code has some unused imports and variables. Consider removing them to simplify the code and reduce clutter.
10. Code style and formatting:
The code has some style and formatting issues, such as inconsistent line spacing, missing spaces after commas, and inconsistent use of parentheses. Consider using a consistent code style and formatting convention throughout the code.

By addressing these suggestions, you can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality.
