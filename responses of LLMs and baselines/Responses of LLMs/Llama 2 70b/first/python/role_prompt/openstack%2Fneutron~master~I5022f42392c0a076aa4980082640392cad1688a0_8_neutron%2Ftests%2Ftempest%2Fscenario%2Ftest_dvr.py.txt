 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few best practices that could be applied to the code:

1. Consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints: The code uses type hints for some variables, but not for all. It's a good practice to add type hints for all variables to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings: The code has docstrings for some functions, but not for all. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions to provide a clear understanding of what the function does and what its inputs and outputs are.
4. Function naming: Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are shorter and less descriptive. It's a good practice to use descriptive and meaningful function names to make the code easier to understand.
5. Error handling: The code has some try-except blocks that catch generic exceptions like `Exception` or `AssertionError`. It's a good practice to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, rather than catching generic exceptions and handling them in a generic way.
6. Code organization: The code has some long methods that perform multiple tasks. It's a good practice to break down long methods into smaller methods each with a single responsibility, to make the code easier to read and maintain.
