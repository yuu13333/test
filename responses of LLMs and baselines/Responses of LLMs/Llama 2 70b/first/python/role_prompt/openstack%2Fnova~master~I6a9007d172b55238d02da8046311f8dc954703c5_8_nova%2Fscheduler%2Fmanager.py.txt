 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable and method names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand, and also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can help provide context and make the code more maintainable.
4. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have inconsistent parameter lists. For example, the `select_destinations` function has a variable number of arguments, which can make it difficult to understand and use correctly. It's better to define a consistent set of parameters and use optional arguments or defaults where necessary.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to manage and maintain. Consider breaking the code into smaller files or modules, each with its own clear responsibilities and functions. This will make the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
6. Testing:
The code lacks tests, which can make it difficult to ensure its correctness and reliability. Consider adding tests for each function and method to ensure that they work correctly and behave as expected.
7. Logging:
The code uses the `logging` module for logging, but it's not configured correctly. Consider setting up proper logging configuration, including log levels, handlers, and formatters, to ensure that log messages are captured and displayed correctly.
8. Error handling:
The code can benefit from better error handling. Consider adding try-except blocks and proper error handling mechanisms to ensure that the code can recover gracefully from errors and exceptions.
9. Security:
The code doesn't appear to have any obvious security vulnerabilities, but it's always a good idea to review security best practices and ensure that the code is secure. Consider using secure coding practices, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to follow. However, with a few improvements, it can become even more maintainable, readable, and secure.
