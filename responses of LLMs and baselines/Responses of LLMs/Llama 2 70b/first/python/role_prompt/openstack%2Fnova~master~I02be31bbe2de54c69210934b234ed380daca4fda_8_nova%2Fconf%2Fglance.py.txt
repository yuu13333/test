 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are some minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent spacing: The code uses inconsistent spacing, which can make it harder to read and understand. It's recommended to use consistent spacing throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings: Some of the configuration options lack docstrings, which can make it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's recommended to add docstrings for all configuration options.
3. Unused imports: The code imports `oslo_config` and `keystoneauth1`, but they are not used anywhere. It's recommended to remove unused imports to reduce clutter and improve code readability.
4. Unnecessary comments: Some comments are not necessary and can be removed. For example, the comment "Enable insecure SSL (https) requests to glance" is not necessary, as the purpose of the configuration option is already clear from its name.
5. Missing default values: Some configuration options lack default values, which can cause issues if they are not specified by the user. It's recommended to add default values for all configuration options.
6. Deprecated options: The code uses deprecated options, such as `api_insecure`, `cafile`, `certfile`, and `keyfile`. It's recommended to remove these deprecated options and use the new options instead.
7. Missing type hints: Some configuration options lack type hints, which can make it difficult to understand their data type. It's recommended to add type hints for all configuration options.
8. Redundant configuration options: Some configuration options, such as `num_retries` and `verify_glance_signatures`, are not used anywhere in the code. It's recommended to remove these redundant configuration options.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and secure. However, addressing the minor issues and suggestions for improvement can make the code more readable, maintainable, and secure.
