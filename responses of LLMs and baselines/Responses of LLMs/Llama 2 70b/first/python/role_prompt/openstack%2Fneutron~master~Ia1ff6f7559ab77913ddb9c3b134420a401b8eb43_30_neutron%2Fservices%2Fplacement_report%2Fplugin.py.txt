 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and organization:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable and method names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future.
3. Function naming conventions:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are shorter and less descriptive. It's better to use consistent naming conventions for functions, such as using descriptive names that clearly indicate their purpose.
4. Code organization:
The code is organized into different sections, but some sections are quite long and complex. It may be helpful to break down the code into smaller, more manageable sections or functions, each with its own clear purpose and responsibilities. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.
5. Comments and documentation:
The code has some comments, but they are not always clear or descriptive. It's important to add clear and concise comments to explain the purpose and behavior of the code, especially for complex sections or functions. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
6. Error handling:
The code has some error handling mechanisms in place, but they could be improved. For example, instead of logging errors and continuing to execute the code, it's better to raise specific exceptions for different error scenarios, so that the code can handle them appropriately.
7. Testing:
The code has some tests, but they could be improved. It's important to write comprehensive tests that cover different scenarios and edge cases, to ensure that the code behaves correctly and consistently.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and organized, but there are some areas where it can be improved for better readability, maintainability, and security.
