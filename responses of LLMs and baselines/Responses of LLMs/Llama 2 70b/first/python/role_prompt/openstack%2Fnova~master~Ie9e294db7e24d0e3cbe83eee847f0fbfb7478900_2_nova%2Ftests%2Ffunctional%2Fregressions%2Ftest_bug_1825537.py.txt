 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
In the code, some variable names use camelCase convention, while others use snake_case. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses Python 3.x, which supports type hints and annotations. It's a good practice to include type hints for function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will help catch type-related errors early and make the code more readable.
3. Docstrings:
The code has a few docstrings, but they are not consistent. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions, methods, and classes to provide a brief description of what they do and what their purpose is. This will help others understand the code better and make it easier to maintain.
4. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are short and not very descriptive. It's a good practice to use descriptive names for all functions, so it's clear what they do without having to read their implementation.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into different classes and methods, but it could be further refactored to reduce duplication and improve readability. For example, the `setUp` method is quite long and could be broken down into smaller methods each with a single responsibility.
6. Test naming:
The test names are not very descriptive. It's a good practice to use descriptive names for tests, so it's clear what they test without having to read their implementation.
7. Test assertions:
The tests use `self.assertEqual` and `self.assertIn` methods for assertions. It's a good practice to use more specific assertion methods, such as `self.assertTrue` or `self.assertFalse`, when appropriate. This will make the code more readable and help catch specific errors more effectively.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand. With a few improvements, it can be even better maintained and scaled in the future.
