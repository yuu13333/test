 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the variables and functions lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all public variables and functions.
3. Unused variables:
The variable `IS_STANDARD_ATTR_EXTENSION` is never used in the code. It's better to remove it or use it appropriately.
4. Unnecessary imports:
The code imports the `http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0` license, but it's not used anywhere in the code. It's better to remove the unnecessary import.
5. Missing `()` in tuple:
In the `REQUIRED_EXTENSIONS` and `OPTIONAL_EXTENSIONS` lists, there are tuples with a single element that are not enclosed in parentheses. It's better to add parentheses to make the code more readable.

Here's an example of how the code could be improved:

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
