 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some methods and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, and return values. Adding docstrings would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports 'quota' and 'exception', but they are not used anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid confusion and keep the code clean.
4. Unused variables:
The code defines 'check_project_id' and 'check_user_id' variables in the 'check_deltas' method, but they are not used anywhere. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code complexity.
5. Complex method signature:
The 'check_deltas' method has a complex signature with many positional and keyword arguments. It's better to simplify the method signature by using a single dictionary argument that contains all the necessary values.
6. Redundant try-except block:
The 'create_limit' and 'update_limit' methods have a try-except block that catches 'exception.OverQuota' and re-raises it with the same message. It's better to remove the try-except block and let the exception propagate up the call stack, as it's already handled by the 'limit_check_project_and_user' method.
7. Missing 'self' parameter:
The 'QuotasNoOp' class lacks a 'self' parameter in its methods. It's better to add the 'self' parameter to make the code consistent with other classes and methods.
8. Unnecessary class:
The 'QuotasNoOp' class seems to be unnecessary, as it doesn't provide any additional functionality or override any methods from the 'Quotas' class. It's better to remove the class and use the 'Quotas' class directly.
