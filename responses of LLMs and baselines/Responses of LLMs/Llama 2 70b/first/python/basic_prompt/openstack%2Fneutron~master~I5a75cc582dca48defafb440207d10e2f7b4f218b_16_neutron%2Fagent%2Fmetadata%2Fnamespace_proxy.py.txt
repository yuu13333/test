 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters and return types. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand, and also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The code can benefit from adding docstrings to functions and classes to provide a brief description of what the function or class does, its parameters, return types, and any other relevant information.
4. Error handling:
The code can benefit from better error handling. For example, in the `cleanup_config_file` function, there is a bare except block that catches all exceptions. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, rather than catching all exceptions and ignoring them.
5. Consistency in indentation:
The code uses inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code for readability.
6. Unused imports:
The code has some unused imports, such as `errno` and `grp`. It's better to remove these unused imports to avoid cluttering the code.
7. Unused variables:
The code has some unused variables, such as `uuid` in the `ProxyDaemon` class. It's better to remove these unused variables to avoid confusion and make the code more readable.
8. Missing `os.path.join` calls:
In some places, the code uses `os.path.join` to concatenate path components. However, there are some places where the code uses string concatenation instead of `os.path.join`. It's better to use `os.path.join` consistently throughout the code to ensure that paths are correctly joined.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. With a few improvements, it can be even better.
