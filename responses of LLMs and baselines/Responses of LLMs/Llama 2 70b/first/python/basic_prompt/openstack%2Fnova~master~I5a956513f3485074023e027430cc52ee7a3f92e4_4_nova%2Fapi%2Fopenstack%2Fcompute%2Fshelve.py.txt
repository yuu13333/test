 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Consistent coding style:
Inconsistent coding style is noticed in the code. For example, in line 41, `context.can()` is called without parentheses, while in line 74, it is called with parentheses. It is better to maintain a consistent style throughout the code.
2. Type hints for function parameters:
Type hints for function parameters are missing in some places, such as in the `_shelve()` and `_unshelve()` functions. Adding type hints can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. docstrings:
 docstrings are missing for some functions, such as `_shelve_offload()` and `_unshelve()`. Adding docstrings can help provide a brief explanation of the function's purpose and parameters.
4. Function name conventions:
Function name conventions are not consistent. Some functions have a leading underscore, while others do not. It is better to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code.
5. Comments:
Comments are missing in some places, such as in the `try` block of the `_shelve()` function. Adding comments can help explain the code's logic and make it easier to understand.
6. Exception handling:
The code catches generic exceptions such as `Exception` and `InstanceInvalidState` without re-raising them. It is better to catch specific exceptions and re-raise them with a more informative error message.
7. Logging:
Logging is not consistent throughout the code. It is better to log important events and errors to help with debugging and troubleshooting.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, addressing the minor issues mentioned above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security.
