 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The code has docstrings for the functions and classes, but they are not consistent. Some docstrings are missing, and some have incorrect formatting. It's better to have consistent and properly formatted docstrings for all functions and classes.
3. Line spacing:
The code has inconsistent line spacing, which can make it difficult to read. It's better to have consistent line spacing throughout the code.
4. Comments:
The code has comments, but they are not very descriptive. It's better to have descriptive comments that explain the purpose of the code and help others understand it easily.
5. Function signature:
The `list_rules()` function doesn't have a clear signature. It's better to specify the return type and any parameters the function takes.
6. Consistency in indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation, which can make it difficult to read. It's better to have consistent indentation throughout the code.
7. Security considerations:
The code doesn't appear to have any security considerations, such as input validation, error handling, or logging. It's important to consider security when writing code to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there are a few improvements that can be made to make it more readable and maintainable.
