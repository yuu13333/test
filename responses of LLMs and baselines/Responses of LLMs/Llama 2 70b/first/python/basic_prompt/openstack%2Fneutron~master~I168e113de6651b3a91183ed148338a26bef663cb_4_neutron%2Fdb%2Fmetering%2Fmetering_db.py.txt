 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable and method names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable definitions. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future.
3. Docstrings:
Adding docstrings to functions and classes can help provide context and explain their purpose. This will make the code more understandable and easier to work with.
4. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are short and cryptic. Try to use descriptive names for all functions, so it's clear what they do without needing to read their implementation.
5. Function size:
Some functions are quite large and perform multiple tasks. Consider breaking them down into smaller functions, each with a single responsibility, to make the code easier to read and maintain.
6. Variable naming:
Some variable names are descriptive, while others are not. Try to use descriptive names for all variables, so it's clear what they represent without needing to read their implementation.
7. Consistent indentation:
The code uses different indentation levels in some places. Make sure to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read.
8. Trailing commas:
Some functions and classes have trailing commas, while others do not. Try to be consistent with using or not using trailing commas throughout the code.
9. Unused imports:
The code has some unused imports, such as `from neutron.db import _utils as db_utils`. Consider removing them to simplify the code and reduce clutter.
10. Code organization:
The code is organized into different modules, but some modules have a lot of functions and classes. Consider breaking them down into smaller modules, each with a single responsibility, to make the code easier to navigate and maintain.

I hope these suggestions help improve the code's readability and maintainability.
