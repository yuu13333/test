 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable and function names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Comments: Some of the comments are not very clear or descriptive. For example, the comment for the `error_application` function does not provide any useful information. It's better to provide more detailed comments that explain the purpose and behavior of each function.
3. Error handling: The code catches and swallows some exceptions (e.g., `exception.ServiceTooOld`) without proper error handling. It's better to handle these exceptions more robustly, for example, by logging the error and providing a more informative error message to the user.
4. Security-related configuration: The code uses hard-coded paths for configuration files (`CONFIG_FILES`). It's better to use environment variables or configuration options to specify these paths, to make the code more flexible and secure.
5. Logging: The code uses the `logging` module to log messages, but it does not configure the logging system properly. It's better to configure logging levels, log formats, and log destinations in a central location, such as a logging configuration file or a configuration module.
6. Code organization: The code is organized into separate functions, but some functions are quite long and complex. It's better to break down these functions into smaller, more focused functions, to improve code readability and maintainability.
7. Testing: The code does not include any tests or test cases. It's better to write tests for the code to ensure its correctness and reliability.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and follows good programming practices. However, there are some areas where it can be improved for better security, readability, and maintainability.
