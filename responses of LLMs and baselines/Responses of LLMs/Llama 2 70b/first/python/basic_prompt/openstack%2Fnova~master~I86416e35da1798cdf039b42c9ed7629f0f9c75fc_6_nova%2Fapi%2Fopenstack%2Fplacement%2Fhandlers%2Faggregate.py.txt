 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have a few suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent coding style:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable and function names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's a good practice to use type hints and annotations for all function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will help catch type-related errors at runtime and make the code more readable.
3. Parameter validation:
The `get_aggregates` function takes a `req` parameter, but it's not validated. It's a good practice to validate the input parameters to ensure they are of the correct type and format.
4. SQL injection prevention:
The code uses SQLAlchemy to interact with the database. It's important to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
5. Error handling:
The code catches some exceptions, but it's not clear how the errors are handled. It's a good practice to handle errors appropriately, such as logging the error, sending a error response to the client, or raising a custom exception.
6. Testing:
The code seems to be lacking tests. It's important to write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the code works as expected and catch any bugs early.
7. Documentation:
The code has docstrings for some functions, but it's not clear what the functions do or what the parameters mean. It's a good practice to write clear and concise docstrings for all functions and variables.
8. Consistent spacing and indentation:
The code has inconsistent spacing and indentation. It's a good practice to use consistent spacing and indentation throughout the code to make it more readable.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there are some areas where it can be improved to make it more maintainable, readable, and secure.
