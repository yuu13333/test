 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that may not be directly related to security but can improve the overall quality of the code:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
3. Docstrings:
Some functions lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and any exceptions they may raise. Adding docstrings can help developers understand the code's intent and usage.
4. Exception handling:
The code catches general exceptions like `Exception` and `ProcessExecutionError`, but it's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately. For example, instead of catching `Exception` in `mount_volume`, it's better to catch ` nova_exception.InternalError` and handle it specifically.
5. Logging:
The code uses both `logging` and `LOG` for logging. It's better to use a single logging mechanism throughout the code for consistency.
6. Utility functions:
Some utility functions like `validate_and_wait` and `umount_volume` are not reusable and are only used in a single place. It's better to extract these functions into a separate module or file and provide them as utility functions that can be reused across the codebase.
7. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to manage and maintain. It's better to break the code into smaller modules or files, each with its own specific responsibility, to improve code organization and maintainability.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and the issues mentioned above are minor and do not directly impact security.
