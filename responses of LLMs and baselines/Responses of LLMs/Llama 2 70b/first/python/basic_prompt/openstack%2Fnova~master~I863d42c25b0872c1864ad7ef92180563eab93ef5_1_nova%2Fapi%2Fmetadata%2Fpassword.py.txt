 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have a few suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent coding style:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can make the code more readable and easier to understand, and can also help catch type-related errors.
3. docstrings:
The functions lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and any other relevant information. Adding docstrings can make the code more understandable and easier to use.
4. Function naming:
Some function names are not very descriptive, such as `extract_password` and `convert_password`. Consider renaming them to something more descriptive, such as `get_password` and `store_password`.
5. Password handling:
The code stores passwords as plain text in system metadata. This is not secure, as it makes the password accessible to anyone with access to the instance's system metadata. Consider using a more secure method, such as encrypting the password or storing it in a secure location.
6. Input validation:
The code does not validate the input password properly. Consider adding checks for password length, characters, and other requirements to ensure that the password is valid and secure.
7. Error handling:
The code does not handle errors properly. Consider adding try-except blocks to handle unexpected errors and provide meaningful error messages.
8. Security-related imports:
The code imports `exc` and `utils` from the `nova` package, but it does not use them anywhere. Consider removing unused imports to reduce the risk of potential security vulnerabilities.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but it can benefit from some improvements to make it more secure, readable, and maintainable.
