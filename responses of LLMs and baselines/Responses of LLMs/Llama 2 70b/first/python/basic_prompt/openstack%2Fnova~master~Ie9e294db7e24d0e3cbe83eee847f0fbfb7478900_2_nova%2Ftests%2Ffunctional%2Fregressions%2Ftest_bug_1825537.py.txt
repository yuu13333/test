 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and methods lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions and methods.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports 'nova.tests.functional.integrated_helpers' but doesn't use it anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
4. Unnecessary comments:
Some comments are not necessary and can be removed. For example, the comment on line 35 'Now resize the server and wait for it to go to ERROR status because the finish_migration virt driver method in host2 should fail.' is not needed as the code itself is self-explanatory.
5. Variable naming:
Some variable names are not very descriptive, for example, 'dest_host' could be renamed to 'destination_host' to make it more clear.
6. FIXME(mriedem) comment:
The FIXME comment on line 70 is not very clear and doesn't provide enough context. It's better to provide a more detailed explanation of the issue and why it's a bug.

Overall, the code seems well-structured and easy to follow. These minor issues can be improved to make the code more maintainable and readable.
