 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and variables lack docstrings that describe their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports the `linux_utils` module, but it doesn't seem to be used anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Unnecessary complexity:
The `test_delete_icmp_entry`, `test_delete_tcp_entry`, and `test_delete_udp_entry` functions seem to have similar logic. Instead of having separate functions for each protocol, it's better to have a single function that takes the protocol number and the entry to be deleted as arguments. This can simplify the code and reduce duplication.
5. Hardcoded IP addresses and port numbers:
The code uses hardcoded IP addresses and port numbers in some places. It's better to use constants or variables to store these values, so they can be easily changed or configured if needed.
6. Missing error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly in some places. For example, if the `conntrack` command fails, the code raises a generic `Exception` instead of catching the specific error and handling it appropriately. It's better to catch specific errors and handle them with appropriate error messages and actions.
