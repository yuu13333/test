 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and variables lack docstrings that describe their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports the `six` module, but it doesn't seem to be used anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to reduce clutter and minimize potential issues.
4. Unnecessary comments:
Some comments are not necessary and can be removed. For example, the comment "``` # Negotiate version with compute server```" is not needed, as the code is self-explanatory.
5. Missing error handling:
The code has several places where errors are raised without proper error handling. For example, if an error occurs during the security handshake, the code raises a generic `exception.SecurityProxyNegotiationFailed` exception without providing any useful information about the error. It's better to catch specific errors and provide more informative error messages.
6. Complexity:
The code has a high level of complexity, with many interdependent functions and variables. It may be beneficial to break the code into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.
7. Code style:
The code uses both tabs and spaces for indentation, which can lead to inconsistent formatting. It's better to stick to a single indentation style throughout the code.
8. Missing tests:
The code lacks tests for various scenarios, such as testing the behavior when the server or client disconnects during the handshake process. Adding tests can help ensure the code's reliability and stability.

Overall, while there are no critical security defects in the code, there are some areas where the code can be improved for better readability, maintainability, and reliability.
