 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent indentation: The indentation of the code is not consistent throughout the file. It is recommended to use four spaces for each level of indentation, as specified in the Python style guide (PEP 8).
2. Missing docstrings: Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose and parameters. It is recommended to add docstrings to improve code readability and help others understand the code.
3. Unused variables: The variable 'e' in line 117 is not used anywhere in the code. It is recommended to remove unused variables to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Unnecessary imports: The imports 'socket' and 'sys' in line 21 and 22 are not used anywhere in the code. It is recommended to remove unnecessary imports to reduce code clutter.
5. Missing exception handling: The 'do_proxy' function in line 163 does not handle exceptions. It is recommended to add try-except blocks to handle exceptions and provide error messages to the user.
6. Hardcoded credentials: The 'CONF.console.allowed_origins' variable in line 123 contains a list of hardcoded origins. It is recommended to move this configuration to a separate configuration file or environment variables to avoid hardcoding.
7. Insecure secret key: The 'secret' variable in line 110 is a hardcoded secret key. It is recommended to generate a secure secret key using a cryptographic library like OpenSSL or hashlib.
8. Missing input validation: The 'connect_info' variable in line 107 does not have input validation. It is recommended to validate the input to ensure that it contains the necessary information and does not contain any malicious data.
9. Use of 'strutils.mask_password': The 'strutils.mask_password' function in line 141 is used to mask the password in the 'connect_info' dictionary. However, it is not clear why this is necessary, as the password is not used anywhere in the code. It is recommended to remove this function call or provide a comment explaining its purpose.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and follows good security practices. However, addressing the minor issues mentioned above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security.
