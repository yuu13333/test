 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and organization:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable names.
2. Type annotations:
The code uses type hints for function parameters and return types, which is great. However, there are a few places where type hints are missing, such as the `trunk` parameter in the `trunk_by_port_provider` function. It's better to add type hints for all parameters and return types to make the code more readable.
3. Docstrings:
The code has docstrings for some functions, but not for others. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions, even if they are trivial. This helps other developers understand the purpose of the function and how to use it.
4. Function signature:
The `trunk_by_port_provider` function takes a `resource` parameter, which is not used anywhere in the function. It's better to remove this parameter and simplify the function signature.
5. Consistent indentation:
The code uses inconsistent indentation in some places. For example, the `if` statement in the `trunk_by_port_provider` function has a different indentation than the rest of the code. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code.
6. Comments:
The code has some comments, but they are not very descriptive. It's better to add more comments to explain the purpose of the code and what it does. This helps other developers understand the code better and makes it easier to maintain.
7. Class organization:
The code has two classes, `TrunkSkeleton` and `TrunkStub`, which are related to each other. It's better to organize them in a way that makes their relationship clear. For example, you can create a `trunk` module and put both classes in it, or you can create a base class called `Trunk` and have `TrunkSkeleton` and `TrunkStub` inherit from it.

Overall, the code looks well-organized, and I don't see any major security issues. However, following these best practices can make the code more readable and maintainable.
