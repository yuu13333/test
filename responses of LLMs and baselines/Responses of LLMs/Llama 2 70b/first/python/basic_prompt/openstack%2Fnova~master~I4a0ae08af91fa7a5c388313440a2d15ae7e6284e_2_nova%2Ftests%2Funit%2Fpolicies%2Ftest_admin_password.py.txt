 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's a good practice to use type hints and annotations for all function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions and classes. Docstrings are useful for providing a brief description of the function or class, and they can help others understand the code without having to read through it.
4. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Comments are essential for explaining the purpose of the code, especially for complex logic. Adding comments will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
5. Testing:
The code has a good test coverage, but it's always a good idea to add more tests to ensure that the code is robust and works as expected.
6. Security:
The code doesn't seem to have any security-related issues. However, it's always a good practice to follow security best practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and secure data storage.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and it's good to see that it's using modern Python features like fixtures and mocking. Keep up the good work!
