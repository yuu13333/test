 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not necessarily be security-related but could still impact the code's functionality or performance:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally a good idea to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code.
2. Unused imports:
The code imports several modules that do not seem to be used anywhere, such as `httplib2` and `six.moves`. Unused imports can make the code harder to understand and may introduce unnecessary dependencies. It's a good practice to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
3. Unnecessary complexity:
The code has a complex structure with multiple threads and queues. While this may be necessary for the code's functionality, it could make it harder to understand and maintain. It's worth considering whether there are ways to simplify the code or break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
4. Missing docstrings:
Some of the functions and classes in the code do not have docstrings. Docstrings can help provide context and explain the purpose of the code, making it easier for others to understand and maintain. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions and classes.
5. Use of `os.path.join`:
The code uses `os.path.join` to concatenate path components. While this is not a security issue, it can lead to issues with paths that contain separators. It's generally safer to use the `pathlib` module, which provides a more robust way of handling paths.

Again, these are not security defects, but rather suggestions for improving the code's readability, maintainability, and performance.
