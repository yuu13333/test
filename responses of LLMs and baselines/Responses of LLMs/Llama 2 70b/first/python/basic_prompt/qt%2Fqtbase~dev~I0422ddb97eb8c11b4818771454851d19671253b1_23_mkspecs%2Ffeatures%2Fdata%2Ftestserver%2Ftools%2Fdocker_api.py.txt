 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Comments:
Some functions and variables lack comments or have incomplete comments. Adding clear and concise comments can help understand the code's purpose and usage.
3. Error handling:
The code uses "exit(-1)" to terminate the program when an error occurs. Instead, consider using a more explicit error handling mechanism, such as raising an exception or using a dedicated error handling function.
4. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are shorter and less descriptive. Consider using more descriptive names for all functions to make the code easier to understand.
5. Variable naming:
Some variable names are descriptive, while others are not. Consider using more descriptive names for all variables to make the code easier to understand.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into separate functions, but some functions are quite long. Consider breaking long functions into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability.
7. Docker version check:
The code uses "check_output" to retrieve the Docker version, but it's not necessary to execute the command directly. Instead, consider using the "docker-python" library's "version" property to retrieve the Docker version.
8. Code style:
Some lines are quite long and could be broken into shorter lines for better readability. Consider following a consistent code style guide, such as PEP 8, to improve code readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and the functionality seems to be well-implemented. With a few improvements, the code can be even more readable, maintainable, and secure.
