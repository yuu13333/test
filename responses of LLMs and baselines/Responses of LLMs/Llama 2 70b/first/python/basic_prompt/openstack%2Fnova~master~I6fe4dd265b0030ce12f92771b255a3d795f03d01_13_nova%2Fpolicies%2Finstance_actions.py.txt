 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the functions and variables lack docstrings. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions, variables, and classes to make the code more readable and understandable.
3. Unused variables:
The variable `DEPRECATED_INSTANCE_ACTION_POLICY` is defined but not used anywhere in the code. It can be removed.
4. Unnecessary imports:
The code imports `policy` and `base` modules, but they are not used anywhere in the code. These imports can be removed.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple modules, but there is no clear separation of concerns. It's better to organize the code into separate modules based on their functionalities.
6. Missing tests:
There are no tests for the code. It's a good practice to write tests for the code to ensure its correctness and reliability.
7. Missing constants:
The code uses hardcoded strings for policy names and descriptions. It's better to define these strings as constants at the top of the file to make the code more readable and maintainable.
