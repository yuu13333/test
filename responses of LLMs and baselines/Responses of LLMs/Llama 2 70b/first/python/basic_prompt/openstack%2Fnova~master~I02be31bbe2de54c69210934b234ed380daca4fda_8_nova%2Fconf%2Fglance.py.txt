 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent indentation: The indentation in the code is inconsistent, with some lines having 4 spaces and others having 8 spaces. It's best to use a consistent indentation throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings: Some of the configuration options lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's recommended to add docstrings for all configuration options.
3. Unused variables: The `deprecated` dictionary and the `ks_loading.register_session_conf_options()` function are not used anywhere in the code. It's best to remove them to avoid unnecessary clutter.
4. Missing type hints: Some of the configuration options lack type hints, which makes it difficult to understand their data type. It's recommended to add type hints for all configuration options.
5. Redundant imports: The `ks_loading` module is imported twice, which is redundant. It's best to remove one of the imports to avoid unnecessary clutter.
6. Missing `default` value: The `api_servers` configuration option lacks a default value. It's recommended to add a default value to ensure that the configuration option is properly initialized.
7. Missing `help` text: Some of the configuration options lack `help` text, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's recommended to add `help` text for all configuration options.
8. Inconsistent naming conventions: The configuration options use both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's best to use a consistent naming convention throughout the code.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and easy to understand, with clear and consistent naming conventions. However, there are a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement that can help make the code more readable and maintainable.
