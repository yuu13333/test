 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Unused imports:
The code imports 'oslo_log' and 'oslo_utils', but they are not used anywhere. It's better to remove these unused imports to reduce clutter.
3. Unnecessary variables:
The code defines 'subprocess' and 'threading' variables, but they are not used anywhere. It's better to remove these variables.
4. Missing docstrings:
Some functions lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's better to add docstrings for all functions.
5. Non-standard coding style:
The code uses non-standard coding style in some places, such as using 'obj' instead of 'object' or 'process' instead of 'process_object'. It's better to follow standard coding styles to improve readability.
6. Unnecessary try-except block:
The 'kill_process' function has a try-except block that catches 'exceptions.ProcessExecutionError', but it's not necessary because the function already returns an error message in the except block. It's better to remove the try-except block and let the function raise the error directly.
7. Missing return type annotations:
Some functions lack return type annotations, which makes it difficult to understand their return types. It's better to add return type annotations for all functions.
8. Non-standard logging:
The code uses a custom logging function 'LOG.debug' instead of the standard logging module 'logging.debug'. It's better to use the standard logging module for consistency.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand, but there are some minor issues that can be improved for better readability and maintainability.
