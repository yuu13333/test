 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code appears to be well-structured, and it includes appropriate comments and documentation. It also uses established Python libraries and frameworks, such as oslo-concurrency and oslo-log, which suggests that the code is following best practices for Python development.

That being said, there are a few minor suggestions that could improve the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code to improve readability.
2. Type hints: The code uses type hints for some function parameters and return types, but not for all of them. Adding type hints for all parameters and return types can help make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Docstrings: The code includes docstrings for some functions, but not for all of them. Adding docstrings for all functions can help provide context and make the code easier to understand.
4. Function signature: Some functions have a long list of parameters, which can make the function signature difficult to read. Consider breaking down long functions into smaller functions each with a single responsibility, this will make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Consistent indentation: The code uses inconsistent indentation in some places, which can make the code harder to read. Make sure to use consistent indentation throughout the code.
6. Comments: The code includes comments, but they are not always clear or descriptive. Consider adding more detailed comments to explain the purpose of the code and what it does.
7. Testing: The code does not include any testing functions, it would be beneficial to add test functions to ensure that the code is working correctly and to make sure that it continues to work correctly as changes are made.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written, and following best practices. However, there is always room for improvement, and addressing the above-mentioned suggestions can help make the code more readable, maintainable, and secure.
