 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
In some places, the code uses camelCase naming conventions (e.g., "consumer_obj"), while in other places, it uses snake_case (e.g., "consumer_id"). It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. For example, in some places, the type hints are provided for function parameters (e.g., `_get_consumer_by_uuid`), while in other places, they are missing (e.g., `create_incomplete_consumers`). It's better to provide type hints and annotations consistently throughout the code to make it easier to understand and maintain.
3. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have a consistent signature throughout the code (e.g., `create_incomplete_consumers`), while others have varying signatures (e.g., `_get_consumer_by_uuid`). It's better to maintain a consistent signature throughout the code to avoid confusion.
4. Comments and docstrings:
The code has minimal comments and docstrings. Adding more comments and docstrings can help make the code easier to understand and maintain. For example, the purpose of the `create_incomplete_consumers` function is not immediately clear from its name, and a comment or docstring would be helpful in explaining its purpose.
5. Consistency in exception handling:
The code uses different exception handling styles in different places. For example, some functions catch and re-raise exceptions (e.g., `create_incomplete_consumers`), while others let the exceptions propagate (e.g., `_get_consumer_by_uuid`). It's better to handle exceptions consistently throughout the code to avoid confusion.
6. Consistency in variable naming:
The code uses different variable naming styles in different places. For example, some variables use camelCase (e.g., "consumer_id"), while others use snake_case (e.g., "uuid"). It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
7. Avoidance of raw SQL:
The code uses raw SQL in some places (e.g., `_get_consumer_by_uuid`). It's generally better to use parameterized queries or ORMs to avoid SQL injection attacks and improve security.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and the above suggestions are minor improvements that can help make the code more consistent and easier to maintain.
