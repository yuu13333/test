 I have reviewed the provided code, and I did not detect any security defects. The code seems to be well-structured, and it does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. The code uses the `ALIAS` constant to define the extension's alias, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It would be better to remove it or use it in the code where appropriate.
2. The `IS_SHIM_EXTENSION` constant is set to `True`, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It would be better to remove it or use it in the code where appropriate.
3. The `IS_STANDARD_ATTR_EXTENSION` constant is set to `False`, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It would be better to remove it or use it in the code where appropriate.
4. The `UPDATED_TIMESTAMP` constant is set to a hardcoded value, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It would be better to remove it or use it in the code where appropriate.
5. The `RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP`, `SUB_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP`, `ACTION_MAP`, and `ACTION_STATUS` dictionaries are empty, but they are not used anywhere in the code. It would be better to remove them or use them in the code where appropriate.
6. The `REQUIRED_EXTENSIONS` and `OPTIONAL_EXTENSIONS` lists are empty, but they are not used anywhere in the code. It would be better to remove them or use them in the code where appropriate.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. However, it would be better to remove unused code elements to make the code more concise and easier to maintain.
