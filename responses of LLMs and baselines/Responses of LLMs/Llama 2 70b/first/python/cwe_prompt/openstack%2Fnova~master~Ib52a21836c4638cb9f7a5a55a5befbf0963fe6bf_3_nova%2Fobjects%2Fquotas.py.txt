 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, some minor issues and suggestions for improvement are:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some methods and functions lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all methods and functions.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports 'quota' and 'exception', but they are not used anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and avoid confusion.
4. Unused variables:
The code defines 'check_project_id' and 'check_user_id' variables in the 'check_deltas' method, but they are not used anywhere. It's better to remove unused variables to keep the code clean and avoid confusion.
5. Complexity:
The 'check_deltas' method is quite complex, with many nested if-else statements. It may be better to break this method into smaller methods each with a single responsibility, for better readability and maintainability.
6. Duplicate code:
The 'create_limit' and 'update_limit' methods are almost identical, with the only difference being the name of the method and the fact that 'update_limit' takes an additional 'user_id' argument. It may be better to merge these two methods into a single method, and use a keyword argument to determine whether it's a create or update operation.
7. Missing tests:
The code does not include any tests for the 'Quotas' class. It's a good practice to include tests for all classes and methods to ensure they are working correctly and to catch any bugs early.

Overall, the code looks well-organized, and there are no major security defects detected. However, following best practices and addressing the minor issues mentioned above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security.
