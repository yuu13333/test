 I have reviewed the code and found a potential security defect.

The issue is related to the use of the `base.RULE_ADMIN_OR_OWNER` and `base.RULE_ADMIN_API` constants in the `policy.DocumentedRuleDefault` functions. These constants are used to define the authorization rules for the policies, but they are not properly defined in the code.

The `base.RULE_ADMIN_OR_OWNER` constant is defined as `('admin_or_owner', 'admin_or_owner')`, but it is not clear what this constant represents or how it is used. Similarly, the `base.RULE_ADMIN_API` constant is defined as `('admin_api', 'admin_api')`, but it is also not clear what this constant represents or how it is used.

Without proper documentation or context, it is difficult to determine whether these constants are appropriate for the policies they are being used in. This lack of clarity could lead to confusion and potential security issues, as it may be difficult to determine whether the policies are correctly authorizing access to the server topology data.

To address this issue, I recommend adding proper documentation to the code to explain the purpose and usage of the `base.RULE_ADMIN_OR_OWNER` and `base.RULE_ADMIN_API` constants. Additionally, it may be helpful to review the authorization rules for the policies to ensure that they are properly securing access to the server topology data.

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to address this issue:
```
14 from nova.policies import base
15 from oslo_policy import policy
16 
17 
18 BASE_POLICY_NAME = 'os_compute_api:servers:topology:%s'
19 
20 server_topology_policies = [
21     policy.DocumentedRuleDefault(
22         BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'index',
23         base.RULE_ADMIN_OR_OWNER,  # <-- Add documentation here
24         "Show NUMA topology data of a given server",
25         [
26             {
27                 'method': 'GET',
28                 'path': '/servers/{server_id}/topology'
29             }
30         ]),
31     policy.DocumentedRuleDefault(
32         # control host NUMA node and cpu pinning information
33         BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'host_info:index',
34         base.RULE_ADMIN_API,  # <-- Add documentation here
35         "List host NUMA id and cpu pinning information of given server",
36         [
37             {
38                 'method': 'GET',
39                 'path': '/servers/{server_id}/topology'
40             }
41         ]),
42 ]
43 
44 
45 def list_rules():
46     return server_topology_policies
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
