 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent indentation: The indentation of the code is not consistent, which can make it difficult to read and understand. It is recommended to use four spaces for each level of indentation, as per the PEP 8 style guide.
2. Missing docstrings: Some functions and classes lack docstrings, which can make it difficult for others to understand their purpose and usage. It is recommended to add docstrings for all functions and classes.
3. Use of 'secret' variable: The 'secret' variable is used in the 'NovaProxyRequestHandlerBase' class, but it is not defined or explained anywhere in the code. It is recommended to define and explain the variable to make the code more readable and understandable.
4. Use of 'utils' module: The 'utils' module is imported, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It is recommended to remove the unused import statement.
5. Use of 'six.moves' module: The 'six.moves' module is imported, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It is recommended to remove the unused import statement.
6. Use of 'http_cookies' module: The 'http_cookies' module is imported, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It is recommended to remove the unused import statement.
7. Use of 'urlparse' module: The 'urlparse' module is imported, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It is recommended to remove the unused import statement.
8. Use of 'socket' module: The 'socket' module is imported, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It is recommended to remove the unused import statement.
9. Use of 'exception' module: The 'exception' module is imported, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It is recommended to remove the unused import statement.
10. Use of 'logging' module: The 'logging' module is imported, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It is recommended to remove the unused import statement.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, it is always a good idea to keep the code clean and maintainable by removing unused imports and adding docstrings where necessary.
