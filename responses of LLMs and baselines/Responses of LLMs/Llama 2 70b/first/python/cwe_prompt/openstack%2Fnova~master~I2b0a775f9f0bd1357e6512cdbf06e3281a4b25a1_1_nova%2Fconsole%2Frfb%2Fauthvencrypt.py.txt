 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
3. Exception handling:
The code catches SSL.SSLError but doesn't handle other possible exceptions that may occur during the handshake process. Consider catching and handling other exceptions, such as socket.error or ssl.CertificateError.
4. Logging:
The code logs only at the debug level. Consider logging at different levels (e.g., info, warning, error) to provide more informative logs.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file. Consider breaking the code into smaller modules or classes to improve code organization and reusability.
6. Security considerations:
The code uses a hardcoded list of supported VeNCrypt sub-auth types. Consider using a configurable list or a more dynamic approach to support new sub-auth types.
7. Code style:
The code uses inconsistent indentation and spacing. Consider using a consistent coding style throughout the code.
8. Testing:
The code doesn't include unit tests or integration tests. Consider adding tests to ensure the code's functionality and security.

Overall, the code seems to implement the VeNCrypt security proxy helper securely, but there is room for improvement in terms of code organization, readability, and testing.
