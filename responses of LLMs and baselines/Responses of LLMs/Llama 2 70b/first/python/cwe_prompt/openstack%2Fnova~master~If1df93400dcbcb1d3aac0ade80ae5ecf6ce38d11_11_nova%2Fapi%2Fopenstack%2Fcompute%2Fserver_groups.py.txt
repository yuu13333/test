 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, it's worth mentioning that the codebase is quite old (2014), and some of the used libraries and frameworks may have known vulnerabilities or outdated best practices. Therefore, it's essential to consider the security context in which this code is being used and ensure that any deployment is properly hardened and updated with the latest security patches.

Additionally, it's good to note that the code seems to be using the `wsgi` module, which is known to have some security vulnerabilities, especially when not properly configured. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the WSGI server is properly configured and hardened.

In summary, while the code itself does not have any apparent security defects, it's important to consider the surrounding security context and ensure that any deployment is properly hardened and updated.
