 I have reviewed the code for security defects using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard, and I have identified one potential security defect.

The potential security defect is in line 41, where the `check_str` attribute of the `policy.DocumentedRuleDefault` class is set to `base.SYSTEM_READER`. This attribute specifies the policy check string, which determines the level of access required to perform the associated operation. In this case, the `SYSTEM_READER` check string grants read-only access to the entire system, which may be too permissive and could potentially expose sensitive information.

A more restrictive check string, such as `base.SYSTEM_READER_SERVICE`, could be used to limit access to only the specific service being updated or deleted, rather than granting read-only access to the entire system. This would help to reduce the attack surface and minimize the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the `deprecated_rule` and `deprecated_reason` attributes of the `policy.DocumentedRuleDefault` class are not actually used anywhere in the code. These attributes are intended to provide a way to deprecate policies in a controlled manner, but they are not being utilized in this case. It may be worth considering whether these attributes are necessary in this code snippet, or if they could be removed to simplify the code.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and easy to follow, and I did not identify any other security defects or issues.
