 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not necessarily be security-related but could still impact the code's functionality or readability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to read and understand. It's generally a good idea to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the functions and classes in the code do not have docstrings. Docstrings help provide context and explain the purpose of the function or class, making it easier for others to understand the code. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions and classes.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports `itertools` and `netaddr`, but they are not used anywhere in the code. Unused imports can make the code harder to read and may cause confusion. It's a good idea to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and organized.
4. Unused variables:
The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `FIELDS_NOT_SUPPORT_FILTER` and `synthetic_fields`. Unused variables can make the code harder to read and may cause confusion. It's a good idea to remove unused variables or use them appropriately in the code.
5. Complexity:
The code has a high level of complexity, with many interdependent classes and methods. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to understand and maintain. It's a good practice to break down complex code into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Lack of comments:
The code does not have many comments explaining the purpose of the classes, methods, and functions. Comments help provide context and explain the purpose of the code, making it easier for others to understand. It's a good practice to include comments throughout the code to help others understand what the code does and how it works.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, following best practices for coding conventions, documentation, and complexity can help improve the code's readability and maintainability.
