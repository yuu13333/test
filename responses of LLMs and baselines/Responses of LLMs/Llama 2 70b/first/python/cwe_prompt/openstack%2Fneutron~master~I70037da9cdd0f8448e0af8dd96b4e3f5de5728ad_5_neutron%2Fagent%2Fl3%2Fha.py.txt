 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. Adding docstrings can help make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports 'oslo_log' and 'oslo_utils' but doesn't use them. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid clutter and potential issues.
4. Unnecessary blank lines:
The code has several blank lines that don't serve any purpose. Removing them can make the code more concise and easier to read.
5. Complexity:
The code has a high level of complexity, with many interdependent functions and classes. It may be beneficial to break down the code into smaller, more manageable parts to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Lack of comments:
Some parts of the code lack comments that explain the reasoning behind certain implementation choices or the purpose of specific functions. Adding comments can help make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
7. Use of 'threading.Lock' instead of 'threading.RLock':
The code uses 'threading.Lock' to synchronize access to the 'transition_states' dictionary. However, since the dictionary is only read from within the 'enqueue_state_
