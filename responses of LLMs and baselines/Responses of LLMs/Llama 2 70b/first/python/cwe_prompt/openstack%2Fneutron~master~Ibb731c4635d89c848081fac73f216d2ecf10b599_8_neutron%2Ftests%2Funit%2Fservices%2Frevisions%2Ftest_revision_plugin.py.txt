 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code indentation is not consistent, and some lines are too long, making them difficult to read. It's recommended to follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code, which provides guidelines for code formatting and layout.

Additionally, some of the test methods are quite long and complex, which could make them difficult to understand and maintain. It's a good practice to break down long methods into smaller ones, each with a single, well-defined responsibility. This will make the code easier to read and maintain over time.

Overall, the code seems well-structured, and the tests cover various scenarios. Keeping the code consistent and well-formatted will make it easier to understand and maintain in the long run.
