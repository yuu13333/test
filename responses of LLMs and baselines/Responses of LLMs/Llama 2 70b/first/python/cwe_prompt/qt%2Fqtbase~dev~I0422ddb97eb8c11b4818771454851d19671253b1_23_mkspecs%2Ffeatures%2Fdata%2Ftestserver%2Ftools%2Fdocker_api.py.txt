 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable naming. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of each section, function, and variable will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are very short. It's better to use descriptive names for all functions to avoid confusion.
4. Indentation:
The indentation is inconsistent in some places. It's better to use four spaces for each level of indentation to maintain consistency.
5. Error handling:
The code uses "exit(-1)" to terminate the program when an error occurs. Instead, it's better to use a specific error message and handle the error gracefully.
6. Security:
Although the code does not contain any security defects, it's essential to keep in mind security best practices when working with Docker and other external tools. For example, it's a good idea to use Docker's built-in security features, such as user namespaces and SELinux, to minimize the attack surface.
7. Testing:
The code seems to be focused on testing Docker configurations. However, it's essential to test the code itself thoroughly to ensure it works correctly and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
8. Code organization:
The code is organized into different functions, but it's not immediately clear how they fit together. It's better to group related functions together and use descriptive names for functions and variables to improve code readability.
9. Environment variables:
The code uses environment variables for some configuration settings. It's a good idea to use environment variables for all configuration settings to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
10. Code style:
The code uses a mix of Python and Bash syntax. It's better to stick to a single syntax throughout the code for consistency and readability.
