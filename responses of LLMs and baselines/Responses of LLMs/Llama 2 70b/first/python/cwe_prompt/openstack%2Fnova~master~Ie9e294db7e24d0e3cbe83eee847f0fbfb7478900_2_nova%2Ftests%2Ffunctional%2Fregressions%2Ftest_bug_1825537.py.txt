 I have reviewed the code and found a potential security vulnerability.

Line 70:
The comment mentions that the allocations are reverted when finish_resize fails, but the code does not properly clean up the resource provider allocations. Specifically, the dest node resource provider allocations are not removed, and the instance allocations are not updated to reflect the new flavor.

This could lead to a situation where a user is able to retain resources even after a resize failure, potentially causing a denial of service or unauthorized access to resources.

To fix this issue, the code should properly clean up the resource provider allocations when finish_resize fails. One way to do this is to update the allocations to reflect the new flavor and then remove the allocations for the old flavor.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to address this issue:
```python
# After the resize fails, update the allocations to reflect the new flavor
self.api.update_server_allocations(server['id'], self.flavor2)

# Remove the allocations for the old flavor
self.api.delete_server_allocations(server['id'], self.flavor1)
```
By doing this, the code ensures that the resource provider allocations are properly cleaned up when finish_resize fails, preventing any potential security vulnerabilities.
