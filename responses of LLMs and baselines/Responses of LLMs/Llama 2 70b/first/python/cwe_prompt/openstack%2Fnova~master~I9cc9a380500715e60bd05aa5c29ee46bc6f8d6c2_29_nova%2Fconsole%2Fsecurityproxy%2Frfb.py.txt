 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that might be worth considering:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Missing docstrings: Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions and classes to make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
3. Unused imports: The code imports some modules that are not used, such as 'six' and 'struct'. It's best to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and avoid potential issues.
4. Unnecessary comments: Some comments are not necessary and can be removed, such as the comment on line 141 that simply restates the code. It's best to avoid unnecessary comments to keep the code clean and focused.
5. Complexity: The code has a high level of complexity, with many nested conditionals and exceptions. It may be worth considering breaking the code into smaller, more manageable functions or methods to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Error handling: The code has a complex error handling mechanism, with multiple levels of except blocks and custom exception types. It may be worth considering using a more straightforward error handling approach, such as raising a single exception type for all errors and handling them in a centralized location.
7. Code organization: The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to manage and maintain. It may be worth considering breaking the code into smaller files or modules, each with its own clear purpose and responsibilities.
8. Testing: The code lacks tests, which are essential for ensuring the code's correctness and reliability. It may be worth considering adding tests to the code to ensure that it functions as intended.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written, and I did not detect any significant security defects. However, the points mentioned above may help improve the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality.
