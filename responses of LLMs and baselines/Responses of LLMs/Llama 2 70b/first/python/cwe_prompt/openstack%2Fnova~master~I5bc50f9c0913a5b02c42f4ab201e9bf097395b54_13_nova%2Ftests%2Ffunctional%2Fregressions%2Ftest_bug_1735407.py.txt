 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some recommendations for improving the code quality and readability:

1. Consistent indentation: Throughout the code, there are inconsistencies in indentation, such as varying numbers of spaces used for indentation. It is recommended to use a consistent number of spaces for indentation to improve readability.
2. Line length: Some lines are very long, making them difficult to read. It is recommended to break long lines into shorter ones to improve readability.
3. Variable naming: Some variable names, such as "fake_network," are not descriptive and do not clearly convey their purpose. It is recommended to use more descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
4. Comments: The code contains comments that are not necessary and do not add value to the code. It is recommended to remove unnecessary comments to reduce clutter and improve readability.
5. Function naming: The function names are not descriptive and do not clearly convey their purpose. It is recommended to use more descriptive function names to improve code readability.
6. Test case organization: The test case is organized in a way that makes it difficult to understand the flow of the test. It is recommended to break the test case into smaller, more manageable sections to improve readability and maintainability.
7. Test method naming: The test methods are not descriptive and do not clearly convey their purpose. It is recommended to use more descriptive test method names to improve code readability.
8. Test data: The test data is not clearly defined, making it difficult to understand the test's requirements. It is recommended to clearly define the test data and its purpose to improve code readability.
9. Test logic: The test logic is complex and difficult to follow. It is recommended to simplify the test logic and break it down into smaller, more manageable sections to improve readability and maintainability.
10. Code style: The code does not adhere to a consistent style guide, such as PEP 8. It is recommended to follow a consistent style guide to improve code readability and maintainability.
