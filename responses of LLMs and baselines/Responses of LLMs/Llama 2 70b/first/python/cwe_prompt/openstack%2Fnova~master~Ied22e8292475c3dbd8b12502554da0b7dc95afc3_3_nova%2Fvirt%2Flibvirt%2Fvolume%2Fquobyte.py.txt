 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few best practices that could be applied to the code:

1. Consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints: The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated with type hints. Adding type hints can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Docstrings: The code does not include docstrings for the functions, which can make it difficult to understand the purpose and parameters of the functions. Adding docstrings can improve the code's readability and help developers understand how to use the functions.
4. Error handling: The code does not handle errors consistently. For example, in the `mount_volume` function, the `systemd-run` command is executed without checking its exit code. Similarly, in the `umount_volume` function, the `umount.quobyte` command is executed without checking its exit code. It's better to check the exit codes and handle errors appropriately.
5. Logging: The code uses both `LOG.debug` and `LOG.info` to log messages. It's better to use a single logging level, such as `LOG.info`, to log all messages.
6. Consistent indentation: The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to use consistent indentation to make the code more readable.
7. Unused imports: The code imports `six` but does not use it anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid cluttering the code.
8. Unused variables: The code defines `DRIVER_CACHE` and `DRIVER_IO` but does not use them anywhere. It's better to remove unused variables to avoid confusion.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and the security defects are not apparent. However, following best practices can make the code more readable, maintainable, and secure.
