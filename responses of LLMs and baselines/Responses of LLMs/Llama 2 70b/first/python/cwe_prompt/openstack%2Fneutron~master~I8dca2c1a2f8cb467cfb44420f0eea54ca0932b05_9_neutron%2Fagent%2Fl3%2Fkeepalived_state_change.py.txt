 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's reliability and maintainability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to read and understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future. It's generally a good idea to stick to a single naming convention throughout the codebase.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the functions and classes in the code do not have docstrings. Docstrings are important for providing context and explanations of the code's purpose and usage. They can also help other developers understand how to use the code and make maintenance easier. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions and classes.
3. Unused imports:
The code has some unused imports, such as `httplib2` and `six.moves`. While this may not be a security issue, it could indicate that some parts of the code are not being used or are not necessary. It's generally a good idea to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
4. Complexity:
The code has a high level of complexity, with many interdependent classes and functions. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to understand and maintain. It's generally a good idea to break down complex code into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Lack of comments:
Some parts of the code lack comments, which can make it difficult to understand what the code is doing and why. Adding comments can help provide context and explanations of the code's purpose and usage.

Overall, while there are no direct security defects in the code, addressing these issues could improve the code's reliability and maintainability.
