 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some methods and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and exceptions. It's helpful to include docstrings to make the code more readable and understandable.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports some modules that are not used, such as `collections` and `contextlib`. It's better to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
4. Unnecessary comments:
Some comments are not necessary and can be removed, such as the comment on line 107 that duplicates the code's logic.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into different sections, but some sections are not clearly defined. It's better to break the code into smaller, more focused functions or classes to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Error handling:
The code catches some exceptions but does not handle them properly. For example, on line 124, the exception is caught and logged, but the code still raises the exception. It's better to handle exceptions appropriately, such as by providing a clear error message and exiting gracefully.
7. Security considerations:
While there are no obvious security defects in the code, it's important to consider security when designing and implementing software. For example, the code uses `utils.execute()` to execute commands, which can be a security risk if the commands are not properly sanitized. It's better to use a secure method to execute commands, such as `subprocess.check_output()`.
