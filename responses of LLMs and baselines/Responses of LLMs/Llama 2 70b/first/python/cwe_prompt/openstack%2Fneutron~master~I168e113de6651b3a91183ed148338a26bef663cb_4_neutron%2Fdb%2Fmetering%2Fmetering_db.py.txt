 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues with the code:

1. Consistent naming conventions are not followed throughout the code. For example, some variable names are camelCase, while others are separated by underscores. It is better to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code for easier readability and maintenance.
2. In line 191, the continue statement is not indented properly. It should be indented to the same level as the preceding if statement.
3. In line 205, the return statement is missing a value. It should be replaced with return list(routers_dict.values()).
4. In line 225, the return statement is missing a value. It should be replaced with return list(routers_dict.values()).
5. In line 234, a filter clause is used to filter the labels based on the label_id. However, this filter clause is not necessary since the same filter clause is applied again in line 235 using the query method. Therefore, line 234 can be removed, and the filter clause can be applied directly in line 235.
6. In line 235, the query method is used to filter the labels based on the label_id. However, since the same filter clause is applied earlier in line 234, this query method can be removed, and the filter clause can be applied directly in line 234.

Overall, the code seems well-structured and easy to read. However, following consistent naming conventions and removing unnecessary code can make the code even more readable and maintainable.
