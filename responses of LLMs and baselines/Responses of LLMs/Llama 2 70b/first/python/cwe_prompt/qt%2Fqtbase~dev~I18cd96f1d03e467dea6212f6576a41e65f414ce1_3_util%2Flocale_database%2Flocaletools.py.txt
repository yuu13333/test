 No security defects are detected in the code.

The supplied code seems to be a collection of utilities and classes for handling and modifying source files. After carefully examining the code, no apparent security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or other issues, were discovered.

The code seems to be well-structured, utilizing context managers and exception handling to ensure proper resource management and error handling. It also employs secure practices such as using the `tempfile` module to create temporary files and appropriately closing resources when necessary.

It is essential to remember that security vulnerabilities may still exist in the code, even though no evident issues have been found. It is always a good idea to continue monitoring the code for potential security risks and to apply best practices for secure coding.
