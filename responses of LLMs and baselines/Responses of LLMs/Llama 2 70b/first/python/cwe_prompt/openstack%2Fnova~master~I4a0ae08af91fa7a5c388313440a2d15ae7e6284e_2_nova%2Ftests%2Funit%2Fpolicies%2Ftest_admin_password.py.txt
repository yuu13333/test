 I have reviewed the code for security defects using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) as a reference standard. Here are my findings:

1. CWE-284: Improper Access Control

Line 47: self.admin_authorized_contexts = [...self.project_member_context, ...]
Line 52: self.admin_unauthorized_contexts = [...self.system_member_context, ...]

The code uses a hardcoded list of contexts that are allowed or not allowed to pass policy checks. This could lead to improper access control if the contexts are not properly validated. It is recommended to use a more dynamic approach, such as using a policy file or a database to store the authorized and unauthorized contexts.

1. CWE-200: Information Exposure

Line 65: body={'changePassword': {'adminPass': '1234pass'}}}

The code exposes the plaintext password '1234pass' in the request body. It is recommended to use a secure mechanism, such as encryption or hashing, to protect the password.

1. CWE-732: Insecure Hash Function

Line 65: body={'changePassword': {'adminPass': '1234pass'}}}

The code uses the plaintext password '1234pass' in the request body, which can be vulnerable to hash attacks. It is recommended to use a secure hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to protect the password.

1. CWE-611: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

The code does not have sufficient logging and monitoring mechanisms in place to detect and respond to security incidents. It is recommended to implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track and alert on security-related events.

To address these security defects, it is recommended to:

1. Use a more dynamic approach to store authorized and unauthorized contexts, such as using a policy file or a database.
2. Use a secure mechanism, such as encryption or hashing, to protect the password in the request body.
3. Use a secure hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to protect the password.
4. Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track and alert on security-related events.

If these recommendations are implemented, the code will have better security controls in place to protect against improper access control, information exposure, and insufficient logging and monitoring.
