 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses some deprecated options and features, such as the 'prevent_arp_spoofing' option, which is deprecated and will be removed in Ocata. It's recommended to remove this option and use the port security extension instead.

Additionally, the code uses the 'drop_flows_on_start' option, which can cause brief traffic interruption. It's recommended to carefully consider the impact of enabling this option and weigh the benefits against the potential drawbacks.

Finally, the code uses the 'tunnel_csum' option, which sets or unsets the tunnel header checksum on outgoing IP packets carrying GRE/VXLAN tunnels. It's recommended to carefully consider the implications of enabling or disabling this option, as it may affect the security and reliability of the tunnel.

Overall, while there are no explicit security defects in the code, it's important to be aware of the deprecated features and carefully consider the implications of enabling certain options.
