 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some names are camelCase (e.g., "QDuplicateTracker"), while others are separated by underscores (e.g., "nextLikelyBucketListSize"). It would be better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Variable naming:
Some variable names are not very descriptive (e.g., "n" and "N"). It would be better to use more descriptive names to make the code easier to understand. For example, "n" could be renamed to "size" or "capacity," and "N" could be renamed to "preallocatedSize."
3. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of the code, especially in the implementation section, would make it easier for others to understand what the code does and how it works.
4. Function signature:
The "appendTo" function takes a reference to a container as an argument, but it modifies the container by pushing back elements. It would be better to use a const reference to the container to avoid modifying it.
5. constexpr:
The "nextLikelyBucketListSize" function is marked as constexpr, but it has a non-constant return type (quint64). Either the return type should be changed to a constant type (e.g., quint64 const) or the function should not be marked as constexpr.
6. Unused variables:
The "setSize" variable is not used anywhere in the code. It should be removed to avoid unnecessary clutter.
7. Redundant code:
The "appendTo" function has two versions, one for const references and another for non-const references. The non-const version calls the const version, which is not necessary. The non-const version could be removed, and the const version could be modified to work for both const and non-const references.
8. Missing include:
The code includes <qglobal.h>, but it does not include <qset.h> or <qhash.h>, which are required for the QSet and QHash classes. These includes should be added to avoid compilation errors.
9. Redundant templates:
The code includes both <memory_resource> and <qhash.h>, which both provide hash functions. It would be better to choose one and remove the other to avoid redundancy.
10. Code organization:
The code is organized into different sections, but some sections are not clearly labeled. It would be better to add clear labels to each section to make the code easier to navigate.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, but there are some areas where it could be improved for readability, maintainability, and security.
