 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that might be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of the code, especially for a unit test file. This will help others understand the code and make it easier to maintain.
3. Unused variables and functions: The code has some unused variables and functions. It's best to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code maintenance.
4. Complexity: Some of the functions are quite complex, with many nested loops and conditional statements. It might be worth considering breaking down these functions into smaller, more manageable pieces for easier maintenance and readability.
5. Redundant comparisons: In some places, the code has redundant comparisons, such as "if (it == end) // same as if (false)" instead of simply using "if (!it)"
6. Unnecessary loops: The "ctorStdMap" function has an unnecessary loop that can be removed. The "QMap<int, int> qmap(map);" line creates a new map with the same contents as the "map" variable, so the loop that follows is not needed.
7. Unused includes: The code includes "main.moc" at the end, but it's not used anywhere in the code. It can be removed.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and the security defects are minor and easily addressable.
