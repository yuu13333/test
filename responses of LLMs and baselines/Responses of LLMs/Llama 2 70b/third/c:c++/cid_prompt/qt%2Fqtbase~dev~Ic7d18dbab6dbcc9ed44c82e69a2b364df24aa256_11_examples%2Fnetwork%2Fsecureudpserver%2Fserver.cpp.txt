 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to explain the purpose and parameters of each function, as well as any assumptions or limitations.
3. Unused variables: The code defines several unused variables, such as `cookieSender` and `serverConfiguration`. It's better to remove them or use them appropriately.
4. Complicated logic: The code has a complex structure with many nested if-else statements. It would be better to break down the code into smaller functions or methods to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Hardcoded values: The code has several hardcoded values, such as IP addresses and port numbers. It's better to define them as constants or configuration variables to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
6. Missing error handling: The code doesn't handle errors properly. It's better to add proper error handling and reporting mechanisms to ensure that the code can recover gracefully from errors and provide useful information to the user.
7. Dependency on Qt: The code heavily depends on Qt, which may limit its portability and reusability. It's better to use standard C++ libraries and APIs whenever possible to improve portability.

Overall, while the code appears to be secure, it could benefit from improvements in readability, maintainability, and flexibility.
