 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For consistency, I recommend using camelCase for variable and function names, as that is the convention used in most of the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add comments and documentation to explain the purpose and usage of classes, functions, and variables. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions. It's best to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code maintenance.
4. Variable naming:
Some variable names are not descriptive or follow a consistent naming convention. For example, "m_window" could be renamed to "window" or "windowPtr" to make it clearer what the variable represents.
5. Function signature:
The function "updateFullScreenAction()" takes no arguments, but it modifies the UI. It's better to pass the window object as an argument to the function, making it more flexible and reusable.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into different namespaces, but some functions and variables are not properly scoped. Make sure to use appropriate namespaces and scope for all code elements to avoid conflicts and improve readability.
7. Unnecessary includes:
The code includes some unnecessary headers, such as "utils/hostosinfo.h" and "coreconstants.h". Remove them to reduce dependencies and improve build times.
8. Unused macros:
The code defines some macros that are not used anywhere. Remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code size.
9. Code style:
The code uses both tabs and spaces for indentation, which can lead to inconsistent formatting. It's best to stick to a single indentation method throughout the code.
10. Error handling:
The code does not handle errors properly. Consider adding error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks or proper error reporting, to ensure the code behaves gracefully in case of unexpected errors.
