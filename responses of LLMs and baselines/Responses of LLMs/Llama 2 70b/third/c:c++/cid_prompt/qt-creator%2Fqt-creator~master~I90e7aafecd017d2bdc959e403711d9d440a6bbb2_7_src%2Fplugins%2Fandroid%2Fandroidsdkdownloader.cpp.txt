 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, a few suggestions for improvement can be made:

1. In function `AndroidSdkDownloader::downloadAndExtractSdk()`, the `QProgressDialog` is created and connected to the `QNetworkReply::downloadProgress` signal, but it is not explicitly deleted when the download is canceled. It would be better to add a `delete` call for the progress dialog in the `cancel()` function to ensure that it is properly cleaned up.
2. In function `AndroidSdkDownloader::extractSdk()`, the `QProcess` object is created and started, but it is not properly cleaned up if an error occurs. It would be better to add a `delete` call for the process object in the `cancel()` function to ensure that it is properly cleaned up.
3. In function `AndroidSdkDownloader::saveToDisk()`, the `QFile` object is created but not properly closed. It would be better to add a `file.close()` call before returning `true` to ensure that the file is properly closed.
4. In function `AndroidSdkDownloader::isHttpRedirect()`, the `QNetworkRequest::HttpStatusCodeAttribute` is used to check the HTTP status code, but it is not properly checked if the attribute is not present. It would be better to add a check for the presence of the attribute before using it.
5. In function `AndroidSdkDownloader::downloadFinished()`, the `QNetworkReply` object is not properly deleted. It would be better to add a `reply->deleteLater()` call at the end of the function to ensure that it is properly cleaned up.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and well-written, and it does not contain any obvious security defects. However, the suggestions mentioned above can help improve the code's reliability and stability.
