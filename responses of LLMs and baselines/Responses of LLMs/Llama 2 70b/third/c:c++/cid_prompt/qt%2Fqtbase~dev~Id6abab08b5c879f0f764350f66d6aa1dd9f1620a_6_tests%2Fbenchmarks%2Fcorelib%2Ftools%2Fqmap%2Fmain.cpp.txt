 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add comments and documentation to explain the purpose and usage of the code, especially for functions and classes.
3. Unused variables and functions: The code has some unused variables and functions. It's best to remove them to avoid confusion and improve code readability.
4. Complicated benchmarking: The code uses QBENCHMARK to measure the performance of various functions. However, the benchmarking code is quite complex, and it's challenging to understand what's being measured and how. It's recommended to simplify the benchmarking code and provide clear explanations of what's being tested and why.
5. Lack of error handling: Some functions, such as `insertion_int_int` and `insertion_string_int`, do not handle errors properly. For example, if the insertion fails, the function does not return an error code or provide any feedback to the user. It's recommended to add proper error handling and documentation to these functions.
6. Unnecessary loops: Some functions, such as `insertion_int
