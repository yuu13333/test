 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's performance, maintainability, or stability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The codebase uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. While this may not be a severe issue, it could lead to inconsistencies and make the code harder to read and maintain. It's recommended to stick to a single convention throughout the codebase.
2. Missing documentation:
The codebase lacks proper documentation. Adding documentation comments for classes, functions, and variables would make the code more readable and easier to understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future.
3. Compiler warnings:
The codebase generates several compiler warnings, such as "warning: unused variable" and "warning: unused function." Addressing these warnings could help improve code quality and reduce the risk of bugs or security vulnerabilities.
4. Code organization:
The codebase is organized into multiple header files and a single source file. While this is not necessarily a problem, it may make the code harder to navigate and maintain. Consider breaking the code into smaller source files and organizing them into logical directories to improve code organization and maintainability.
5. Use of `QPointer`:
The codebase uses `QPointer` to store pointers to objects. While `QPointer` can be useful in some cases, it can also introduce performance overhead and make the code harder to read. Consider using smart pointers (e.g., `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr`) or raw pointers with proper memory management instead.
6. Use of `QObject::disconnect()`:
The codebase uses `QObject::disconnect()` to disconnect signals. While this is not necessarily a problem, it can lead to issues when used with threads. Consider using a thread-safe approach
