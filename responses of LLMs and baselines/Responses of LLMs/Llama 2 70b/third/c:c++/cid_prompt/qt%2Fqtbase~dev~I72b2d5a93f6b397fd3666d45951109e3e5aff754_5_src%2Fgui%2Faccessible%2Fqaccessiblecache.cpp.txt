 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Comments and documentation:
The code has adequate comments and documentation, but there is room for improvement. Some functions and variables could benefit from more detailed explanations of their purpose and behavior. Additionally, some comments are not entirely clear or concise.
3. Error handling:
The code handles errors and exceptions well, but there are a few places where error handling could be improved. For example, in the `insert` function, if the `object` parameter is null, the function will crash. It's better to check for null pointers and handle them gracefully.
4. Code organization:
The code is well-organized, but there are a few places where it could be improved. For example, the `objectDestroyed` function is quite long and complex. It might be better to break it up into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Style and formatting:
The code adheres to a consistent style and formatting convention, but there are a few minor issues. For example, some lines are quite long and could be broken up for better readability. Additionally, some braces and parentheses are not aligned properly.

Overall, the code looks well-written and secure. However, there are a few areas where improvements could be made to enhance readability, maintainability, and error handling.
