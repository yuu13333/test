 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. The code uses both `QObject` and `QVariantMap` without proper initialization. It's recommended to use modern C++11/C++14 syntax to create objects, e.g., `QObject{parent, id}` instead of `QObject* parent = nullptr; QObject obj(parent, id);`
2. The `ProjectConfiguration` class has a `macroExpander` member variable, which is not initialized in the constructor. It's recommended to initialize it with a default value to avoid potential issues.
3. The `ProjectConfigurationAspect` class has a `m_projectConfiguration` member variable, which is not initialized in the constructor. It's recommended to initialize it with a nullptr to avoid potential issues.
4. The `ProjectConfigurationAspect` class has a `addToConfigurationLayout` method that is declared as pure virtual, but it's not implemented in the base class. It's recommended to either implement it or remove the pure virtual declaration.
5. The `ProjectConfiguration` class has a `fromMap` method that is declared as virtual, but it's not implemented in the base class. It's recommended to either implement it or remove the virtual declaration.
6. The `ProjectConfiguration` class has a `toMap` method that is declared as virtual, but it's not implemented in the base class. It's recommended to either implement it or remove the virtual declaration.
7. The `ProjectConfiguration` class has a `extraAspect` method that returns a raw pointer to a `ProjectConfigurationAspect` object. It's recommended to return a smart pointer instead, such as a `std::unique_ptr` or a `QSharedPointer`.
8. The `ProjectConfiguration` class has a `aspects` method that returns a list of `ProjectConfigurationAspect` objects. It's recommended to return a const reference to the list instead of a copy of the list.

These are minor issues and do not affect the security of the code. However, addressing them can improve the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.
