 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. The code uses both `Q_CORE_EXPORT` and `Q_DISABLE_COPY` macros, which are both part of the Qt framework. It would be better to use a single macro for consistency, for example, `Q_CORE_EXPORT` could be used instead of `Q_DISABLE_COPY`.
2. The `QTemporaryDirPrivate` class is not defined in the code snippet provided, but it is referenced in the `QTemporaryDir` class. It would be better to include the definition of `QTemporaryDirPrivate` in the code snippet for completeness.
3. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `path()` const method that returns a `QString` object. It would be better to use a `const QString&` return type instead of a `QString` object to avoid unnecessary copies of the string.
4. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `filePath(const QString& fileName)` const method that returns a `QString` object. It would be better to use a `const QString&` return type instead of a `QString` object to avoid unnecessary copies of the string.
5. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `setAutoRemove(bool b)` method that takes a `bool` argument. It would be better to use a `const bool&` parameter instead of a `bool` parameter to avoid unnecessary copies of the boolean value.
6. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `remove()` method that returns a `bool` value. It would be better to use a `const bool&` return type instead of a `bool` value to avoid unnecessary copies of the boolean value.
7. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `errorString()` const method that returns a `QString` object. It would be better to use a `const QString&` return type instead of a `QString` object to avoid unnecessary copies of the string.
8. The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `isValid()` const method that returns a `bool` value. It would be better to use a `const bool&` return type instead of a `bool` value to avoid unnecessary copies of the boolean value.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices.
