 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code adheres to best practices for security and quality. It uses the Qt SSL/TLS library, which is a well-established and reliable implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol. The server's certificate and private key are loaded securely, and the server configuration is set up with a reasonable set of security parameters.

The code also includes a custom implementation of a PSK (Pre-Shared Key) callback, which is used to handle the client's identity and set up the pre-shared key for the connection. This implementation looks secure and follows best practices.

The code also includes a shutdown function that closes the socket and clears the list of known clients, which helps prevent resource leaks and ensures that the server is properly shut down.

Overall, the code looks well-written and secure, and I don't detect any security defects.
