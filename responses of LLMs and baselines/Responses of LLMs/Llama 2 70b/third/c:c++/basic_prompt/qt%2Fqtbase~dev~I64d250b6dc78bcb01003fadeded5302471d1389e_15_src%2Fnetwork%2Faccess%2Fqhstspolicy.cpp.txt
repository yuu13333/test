 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation: Some functions and variables lack documentation. It's important to add documentation to make the code more readable and understandable.
3. Unused variables: The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code size.
4. Unnecessary pointers: The code uses pointers for some variables that don't need to be pointers. For example, the `d` pointer in the `QHstsPolicy` class can be a regular member variable instead of a pointer.
5. Missing const-correctness: Some functions are missing the `const` keyword where it is needed. For example, the `host()` function should be `const` since it doesn't modify the object.
6. Unnecessary copying: The code uses the copy-and-swap idiom for the move assignment operator, but it's not necessary in this case since the class doesn't have any resources that need to be released.
7. Missing exception handling: The code doesn't handle exceptions properly. For example, if the `QUrl::setHost()` function throws an exception, it's not caught or handled anywhere.

Overall, the code is well-written, and there are no major security defects. However, addressing these minor issues can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and robustness.
