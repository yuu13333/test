 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use separate words with underscores. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Comments and documentation:
The code has minimal comments and documentation. Adding more comments and documentation can help make the code easier to understand and maintain
