 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use separate words with underscores. It is recommended to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code for better readability and maintainability.
2. Comments:
The code lacks comments in some places, making it difficult to understand what the code does. Adding comments to explain the purpose of the code and the logic behind it will make it easier for others to understand and maintain.
3. Function size:
Some functions, such as the `WindowSupport` constructor, are quite long and perform multiple tasks. It would be better to break these functions down into smaller functions, each with a single responsibility, to improve readability and maintainability.
4. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as `m_shutdown`, are not very descriptive. It would be better to use more descriptive names to indicate their purpose, such as `isShuttingDown` or `shutdownInProgress`.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into different namespaces, but it would be better to group related functions and variables into separate classes or modules. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain, and will also help to reduce the risk of naming conflicts.
6. Error handling:
The code does not handle errors very well. For example, if an action is not registered, it will crash. It would be better to handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
7. Security:
The code uses hardcoded paths and file names, which can be a security risk. It would be better to use relative paths or configure paths instead.
8. Code style:
The code uses inconsistent indentation and spacing. It would be better to follow a consistent coding style throughout the code to improve readability.
9. Unused code:
Some functions and variables are not used anywhere in the code. It would be better to remove them to reduce clutter and improve maintainability.
10. Testing:
The code does not seem to have any testing or debugging code. It would be better to add testing code to ensure that the code works correctly and to catch any bugs early.
