 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured and follows best practices for C++ programming. It uses constexpr functions and variables, static analysis, and runtime checks to ensure the code's correctness and security. It also uses Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS to declare operators for the Flag enum class, which helps to prevent mistakes and improve code readability.

The code also uses Q_CORE_EXPORT, which is a Qt-specific annotation that indicates that a function or variable should be exported from the Qt Core library. This suggests that the code is designed to be used as part of a larger Qt-based application, and that it follows the Qt coding style and conventions.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and secure, and it does not contain any obvious security defects.
