 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. The code uses the `Q_DECLARE_PRIVATE` and `Q_DISABLE_COPY_MOVE` macros to declare private members and disable copy and move semantics. While this is not a security issue, it is worth noting that these macros are not needed in this case because the classes are not meant to be instantiated directly. The `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` and `QNetworkStatusMonitor` classes are meant to be used as singletons, and their constructors are not exposed to the user. Therefore, the private members are already inaccessible to the user, and the macros are not providing any additional security.
2. The `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` class has a `startMonitoring` function that takes a `QHostAddress` parameter. The function does not validate the input parameter, which could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior if an invalid address is passed. It is recommended to add a check for the validity of the input parameter, for example, by using the `QHostAddress::isValid()` function.
3. The `QNetworkStatusMonitor` class has a `start` function that is meant to be called by the user to start monitoring the network status. However, the function does not provide any feedback to the user about whether the monitoring was successful or not. It is recommended to add a return value or a signal that indicates whether the monitoring was successful or not.
4. The `QNetworkStatusMonitor` class has a `isNetworkAccesible` function that is meant to check whether the network is accessible. However, the function does not provide any implementation, and it is not clear how the function is supposed to work. It is recommended to provide an implementation for this function or to remove it altogether.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and secure. However, the minor issues mentioned above could be improved to make the code more robust and user-friendly.
