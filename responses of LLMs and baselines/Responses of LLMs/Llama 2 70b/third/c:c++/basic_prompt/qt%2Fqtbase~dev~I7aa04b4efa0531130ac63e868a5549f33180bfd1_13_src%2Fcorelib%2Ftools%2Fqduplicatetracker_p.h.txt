 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code seems to be a header file for a C++ class called `QDuplicateTracker`, which is used to keep track of unique items in a list. The class has various methods for inserting items, checking if an item has been seen before, and retrieving the size of the list.

The code uses C++14 features such as constexpr functions, inline variables, and generic programming with templates. It also uses the Qt library's `QSet` class and `QHash` class for storing and retrieving items.

I have reviewed the code carefully, and I cannot find any security vulnerabilities or defects. The code seems to be well-written and follows good coding practices.

However, I would like to mention a few minor issues that may not be directly related to security but could still improve the code's quality:

1. The code uses a `qsizetype` type alias for `size_t`, which is not a standard type. It would be better to use the standard `size_t` type instead, which is defined in the `<cstdlib>` header file.
2. The `QDuplicateTracker` class has a `reserve` method that takes a size parameter, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It would be better to remove this unused method to avoid confusion.
3. The `QDuplicateTracker` class has a `clear` method that clears the contents of the list. However, it would be better to add a `clear` method that takes a `size_t` parameter and clears the contents of the list up to that size, similar to the `reserve` method.
4. The code uses a `QHasher` struct that is not used anywhere in the code. It would be better to remove this unused struct to avoid confusion.
5. The code uses a `node_guesstimate_1` and `node_guesstimate_2` struct that are not used anywhere in the code. It would be better to remove these unused structs to avoid confusion.
6. The code uses a `bufferSize` function that calculates the size of the buffer needed for the `QDuplicateTracker` class. However, the function is not used anywhere in the code. It would be better to remove this unused function to avoid confusion.
7. The code uses a `Q_DISABLE_COPY_MOVE` macro to disable copying and moving of the `QDuplicateTracker` class. However, it would be better to use the standard `Q_DISABLE_COPY` and `Q_DISABLE_MOVE` macros instead, which are defined in the Qt library's `<QObject>` header file.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written and secure. However, there are some minor issues that could be improved to make the code more maintainable and readable.
