 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add comments and documentation to the code to make it easier for others to understand and maintain.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions, such as `m_shutdown` and `updateFullScreenAction()`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and make the code more maintainable.
4. Complicated logic:
The code has some complicated logic, especially in the `WindowSupport` class. It's better to break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions to make it easier to understand and maintain.
5. Missing error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly. It's better to add error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, to handle unexpected errors and make the code more robust.
6. Unnecessary includes:
The code includes some unnecessary headers, such as `<app/app_version.h>`. It's better to remove them to reduce the code's size and improve its performance.
7. Missing const-correctness:
The code misses const-correctness in some places, such as the `m_window` member variable. It's better to add const-correctness to ensure the code's stability and security.
8. Missing nullptr checks:
The code doesn't check for nullptr in some places, such as the `m_window` member variable. It's better to add nullptr checks to prevent crashes and improve the code's stability.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, but it can be improved with better naming conventions, documentation, and error handling.
