 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are not consistent. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Comments:
The code lacks comments in some places, making it difficult to understand what the code does. Adding comments can help improve code readability and make it easier for others to understand the code.
3. const correctness:
In some places, the code uses non-const references to const objects. For example, in the `insertion_int_int` function, the `map` object is a const reference, but it's being modified. It's better to use a non-const reference or to make a copy of the object if modification is necessary.
4. Iterator usage:
The code uses iterators in some places, but it's not clear why they're being used. For example, in the `iteration` function, the `QMap<int, int>::const_iterator` is used, but it's not necessary. It's better to use a range-based for loop instead.
5. Unnecessary functions:
Some functions, such as `ctorStdMap`, seem to be unnecessary and can be removed.
6. Unused variables:
Some variables, such as `sum` in the `lookup_int_int` function, are not used and can be removed.
7. Unnecessary includes:
The code includes some unnecessary headers, such as `<qdebug.h>`. It's better to remove them to reduce code clutter.
8. Missing returns:
Some functions, such as `insertion_string_int2` and `insertion_string_int2_hint`, are missing a return statement. It's better to add a return statement at the end of the function to indicate that the function has completed successfully.
9. Redundant comparisons:
In some places, the code uses redundant comparisons, such as `if (it == end) { ... }`. It's better to use a single comparison and avoid the unnecessary branch.
10. Consistent indentation:
The code uses inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to use consistent indentation to make the code more readable.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, but there are some areas where it can be improved for readability, maintainability, and performance.
