 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to the functions, classes, and variables to make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions, such as `serverConfiguration` and `pskRequired`. It's better to remove them or use them appropriately.
4. Complicated code structure:
The code has a complicated structure with many nested if-else statements and switch-case statements. It would be better to break down the code into smaller functions and use a more structured approach to make it easier to understand and maintain.
5. Hard-coded values:
The code has some hard-coded values, such as the port number and protocol version, which could be configured dynamically instead.
6. Missing error handling:
The code lacks proper error handling in some places. For example, in the `readyRead` function, there is no error handling for the `readDatagram` function. It would be better to add some error handling to handle unexpected errors.
7. Unnecessary includes:
The code includes some unnecessary headers, such as `server.h`, which could be removed.
8. Unused classes:
The code has some unused classes, such as `DtlsServer`, which could be removed.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there are some areas where it could be improved for better maintainability and readability.
