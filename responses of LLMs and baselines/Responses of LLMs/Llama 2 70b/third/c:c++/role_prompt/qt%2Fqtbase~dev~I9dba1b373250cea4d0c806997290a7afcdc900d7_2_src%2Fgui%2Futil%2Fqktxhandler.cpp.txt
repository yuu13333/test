 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Comments and documentation:
The code has minimal comments and documentation. Adding more comments and documentation can help make the code easier to understand and maintain. For example, a brief description of the purpose of each function or variable would be helpful.
