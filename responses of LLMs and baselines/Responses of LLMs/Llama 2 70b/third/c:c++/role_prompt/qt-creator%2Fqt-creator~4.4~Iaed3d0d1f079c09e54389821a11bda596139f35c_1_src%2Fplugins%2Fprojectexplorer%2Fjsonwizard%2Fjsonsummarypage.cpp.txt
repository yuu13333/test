 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type annotations and semantic meaning:
Some variable names, such as `m_wizard`, `m_fileList`, and `m_hideProjectUiValue`, do not clearly convey their semantic meaning. Consider using more descriptive variable names or adding type annotations to clarify their purpose.
3. Function naming conventions:
Function names like `summarySettingsHaveChanged`, `updateFileList`, and `updateProjectData` are a bit long and unclear. Consider using shorter and more descriptive function names that indicate their purpose.
4. Function signature consistency:
Some functions, such as `JsonSummaryPage::addToProject`, have a inconsistent signature. Consider using a consistent signature throughout the code, such as always using `const JsonWizard::GeneratorFiles &files` as a parameter.
5. Unnecessary variables:
Some variables, such as `contextNode`, are not used anywhere in the code. Consider removing them to reduce code clutter.
6. Redundant code:
Some code snippets, such as the `QTC_CHECK(false)` statement in `JsonSummaryPage::addToProject`, are redundant and can be removed.
7. Missing documentation:
The code lacks documentation for some functions and variables. Consider adding documentation comments to clarify their purpose and usage.
8. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple namespaces, but some functions and variables are not properly scoped. Consider properly scoping the code to improve its readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, but there are some areas where it can be improved for better readability and maintainability.
