 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. The code uses the `QUrl` class to represent URLs, which is good. However, it would be better to use the `QUrl::fromString()` function to create URLs from strings, rather than constructing them manually. This would help prevent potential issues with invalid URLs.
2. The `QHstsPolicy` class has a `setHost()` function that takes a `QUrl::ParsingMode` parameter. However, the `QUrl::ParsingMode` enum is not documented, and it is not clear what the different values represent. It would be better to use a more descriptive enum or a string literals for the different parsing modes.
3. The `QHstsPolicy` class has a `setExpiry()` function that takes a `QDateTime` parameter. However, the `QDateTime` class does not provide any functionality for checking whether a date and time are valid. It would be better to add a check to ensure that the expiration date is valid before setting it.
4. The `QHstsPolicy` class has a `includesSubDomains()` function that returns a boolean value indicating whether subdomains are included. However, the name of the function is not very descriptive, and it is not clear what the function does without reading the documentation. It would be better to use a more descriptive name, such as `includesSubdomains()` or `isSubdomainIncluded()`.
5. The `QHstsPolicy` class has an `operator==()` function that compares two policies for equality. However, the function only checks whether the host name, expiration date, and inclusion of subdomains are the same. It does not check whether the policies have the same parsing mode or whether the URLs are equal. It would be better to add additional checks to ensure that the policies are truly equal.

Overall, the code looks well-written and secure. However, there are a few improvements that could be made to make the code more readable, maintainable, and secure.
