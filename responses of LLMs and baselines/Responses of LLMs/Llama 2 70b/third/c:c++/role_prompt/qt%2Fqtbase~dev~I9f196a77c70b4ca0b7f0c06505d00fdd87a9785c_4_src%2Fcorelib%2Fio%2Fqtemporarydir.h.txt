 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few best practices that could be applied to improve the code quality and maintainability:

1. Use consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Use const correctness: The `QTemporaryDir` class has a `path()` const method, but it's not marked as const. It's better to mark it as const to ensure that the object is not modified accidentally.
3. Use unique_ptr or shared_ptr: Instead of using raw pointers, it's better to use unique_ptr or shared_ptr to automatically manage memory.
4. Use Qt's built-in containers: Instead of using std::vector, it's better to use Qt's built-in containers like QVector.
5. Use QString instead of std::string: Instead of using std::string, it's better to use QString, which is Qt's string class and provides additional functionality.
6. Use Qt's error handling mechanism: The code uses a custom error string, it's better to use Qt's error handling mechanism (e.g., Q_FOREACH, Q_CHECKPOINT) to provide more informative error messages.
7. Add documentation: The code lacks documentation, it's better to add documentation to the classes, methods, and variables to provide more information about their purpose and usage.
8. Use Q_DISABLE_COPY instead of Q_DISABLE_ASSIGN: Q_DISABLE_ASSIGN is deprecated, it's better to use Q_DISABLE_COPY instead.

It's worth mentioning that these are just suggestions, and the code provided seems to be well-written and follows good coding practices.
