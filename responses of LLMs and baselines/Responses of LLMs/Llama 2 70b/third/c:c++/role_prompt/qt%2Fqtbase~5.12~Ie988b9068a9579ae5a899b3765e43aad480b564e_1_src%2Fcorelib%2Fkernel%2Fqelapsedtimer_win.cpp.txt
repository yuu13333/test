 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's performance or reliability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it can make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally a good idea to follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase.
2. Unused variables and functions: The code defines several variables and functions that are not used anywhere. For example, the `Q_UNUSED` macro is used to ignore unused variables, but it's still good practice to remove them altogether to avoid confusion and reduce code size.
3. Compiler warnings: The code may generate compiler warnings, such as "warning: unused variable" or "warning: unused function". While these warnings don't necessarily indicate security issues, they can indicate potential problems or unintended behavior. It's a good idea to address these warnings and ensure that all variables and functions are used appropriately.
4. Integer overflow: The code uses arithmetic operations on integer variables without checking for overflow. For example, in the `ticksToNanoseconds` function, the calculation `nsec * qint64(counterFrequency)` could potentially overflow if `counterFrequency` is a large value. While this may not be a security issue, it could result in unexpected behavior or incorrect calculations.
5. Lack of error handling: The code does not handle errors or exceptions properly. For example, if `QueryPerformanceFrequency` or `QueryPerformanceCounter` fails, the code does not handle the error appropriately. It's a good idea to add proper error handling and checking for unexpected inputs or conditions.

Overall, while there are no direct security defects in the code, addressing these issues can improve the code's reliability, readability, and performance.
