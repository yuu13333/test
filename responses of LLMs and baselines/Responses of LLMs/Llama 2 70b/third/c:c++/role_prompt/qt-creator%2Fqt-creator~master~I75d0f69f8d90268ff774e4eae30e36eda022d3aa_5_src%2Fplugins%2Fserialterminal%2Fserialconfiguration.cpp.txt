 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and underscore for variable and function names.
2. Add documentation comments:
The code lacks documentation comments for classes, functions, and variables. Adding documentation comments can help developers understand the code better and make it easier to maintain.
3. Use const correctness:
In some places, the code modifies member variables without a good reason. For example, in the `SerialControl::start()` function, the `m_retrying` variable is modified unnecessarily. It's better to use const correctness to ensure that member variables are not modified unnecessarily.
4. Use unique_ptr or shared_ptr:
The code uses raw pointers to manage memory. It's better to use unique_ptr or shared_ptr to manage memory and avoid memory leaks.
5. Use QObject::move() instead of QObject::copymove():
The code uses QObject::copymove() to move objects. However, QObject::move() is the preferred way to move objects in Qt.
6. Use QMetaObject::invokeMethod() instead of QTimer::singleShot():
The code uses QTimer::singleShot() to call a function after a delay. However, QMetaObject::invokeMethod() is a better way to call a function after a delay, as it allows the function to be called at a specific time and provides better control over the timing.
7. Use QRegularExpression instead of QString::fromUtf8():
The code uses QString::fromUtf8() to convert a byte array to a string. However, QRegularExpression can be used to perform the same operation more efficiently.
8. Use QSerialPort::errorString() instead of hardcoding error messages:
The code hardcodes error messages in some places. Instead, it's better to use QSerialPort::errorString() to retrieve the error message from the serial port.
9. Add error handling for QSerialPort::open() and QSerialPort::write():
The code does not handle errors when opening the serial port or writing data to it. It's better to add error handling to ensure that the code can handle failures gracefully.
10. Use a consistent indentation:
The code uses different indentation levels in different places. It's better to use a consistent indentation level throughout the code to make it easier to read.

These are just suggestions for improvement, and the code generally looks well-structured and well-written.
