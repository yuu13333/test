 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. The code uses `QLatin1String` literals for some string constants, which can be a potential issue if the strings need to be translated. It's better to use `QString` literals instead, which can be translated easily.
2. The `EmrunRunConfiguration` class has a member variable `m_portsGatherer` that is not initialized properly. It's better to initialize it in the constructor instead of leaving it uninitialized and then assigning it a value in the `start` method.
3. The `EmrunRunWorker` class has a member variable `m_portsGatherer` that is not used anywhere. It's better to remove it to avoid confusion.
4. The `EmrunRunConfigurationFactory` and `EmrunRunWorkerFactory` classes are not using the `QLatin1String` literals consistently. It's better to use them consistently throughout the code.
5. The code is using `tr()` function to translate strings, but it's not clear where these translations are defined. It's better to define these translations in a separate file or namespace to keep the code organized.
6. The code is using `Core::Id` type for some member variables, which is not very descriptive. It's better to use more descriptive types, such as `QString` or `int`, to make the code more readable.
7. The code is using `auto` type for some variables, which can make the code less readable. It's better to use more descriptive types to make the code more readable.
8. The code is using `using namespace` directives, which can make the code less readable and may introduce naming conflicts. It's better to use `using` directives only when necessary and to use namespace aliases instead of `using namespace` directives.

Overall, the code looks well-organized and follows good coding practices. However, there are some minor issues that can be improved to make the code more readable and maintainable.
