 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of variables, functions, and classes will make the code more readable and understandable.
3. Function naming:
Some function names are very long and descriptive, while others are short and unclear. It's better to use descriptive and meaningful function names to make the code more readable.
4. Variable naming:
Some variable names are descriptive, while others are not. It's better to use descriptive variable names to make the code more readable.
5. Indentation:
The indentation is inconsistent in some places. It's better to use consistent indentation to make the code more readable.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into namespaces, but it's not clear how the namespaces are related. It's better to use a clear and consistent naming convention for namespaces and to organize the code in a way that makes it easy to understand and navigate.
7. Error handling:
The code does not handle errors well. It's better to add error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, to handle unexpected errors and to provide informative error messages.
8. Performance:
The code uses recursion in some places, which can be inefficient. It's better to use iterative algorithms or to use a more efficient recursive algorithm.
9. Testing:
The code does not have any tests. It's better to add tests to ensure that the code works correctly and to catch bugs early.
10. Code style:
The code does not follow a consistent style. It's better to follow a consistent style, such as the Google C++ Style Guide or the LLVM Code Style Guide, to make the code more readable and maintainable.
