 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to the functions and classes to make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
3. Unused variables and functions: The code has some unused variables and functions. It's better to remove them or use them properly.
4. Complexity: The code has a high level of complexity, with many nested if-else statements and switch-case blocks. It would be better to break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions.
5. Error handling: The code has limited error handling. It would be better to add proper error handling and exception handling mechanisms to ensure that the code can handle unexpected inputs and errors gracefully.
6. Security: While there are no security defects in the code, it's essential to keep in mind security considerations when developing software. Proper input validation, error handling, and encryption are crucial aspects of security that should be considered.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but some improvements could be made to make it more maintainable, readable, and secure.
