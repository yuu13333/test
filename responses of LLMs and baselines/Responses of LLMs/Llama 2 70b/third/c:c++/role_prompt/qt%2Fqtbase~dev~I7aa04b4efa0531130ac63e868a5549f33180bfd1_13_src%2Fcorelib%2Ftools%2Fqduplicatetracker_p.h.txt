 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured, and it uses the Qt Private namespace to define a class called QDuplicateTracker, which is designed to track duplicates in a list. The class uses a hash table to store the elements, and it provides methods to check whether an element has already been seen, insert a new element, and clear the list.

The code uses C++14 features such as constexpr, inline, and decltype to optimize the performance and reduce the code size. It also uses the Qt library's macros and functions to handle memory management and other low-level tasks.

Overall, the code looks clean and well-maintained, and it does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. However, it is always possible that a more in-depth analysis might reveal some potential issues.
