 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are not consistent. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Use const correctness:
In some places, the code modifies objects unnecessarily. For example, in the `insertion_int_int` function, the `map` object is modified unnecessarily. It's better to use const correctness to ensure that objects are not modified unnecessarily.
3. Use C++11/C++14 features:
The code uses some C++98 features, such as the use of `std::pair` and `std::map`. Consider using C++11/C++14 features, such as `std::tuple` and `std::unordered_map`, which can provide better performance and convenience.
4. Use QMap's insertion methods:
The code uses the `insert` method of `QMap` to insert elements, which can be slow for large datasets. Consider using the `insertMulti` method, which can insert multiple elements at once and can be faster.
5. Use QBenchmark:
The code uses a custom benchmarking mechanism, which can be error-prone and difficult to maintain. Consider using the `QBenchmark` class, which provides a more convenient and reliable way to measure the performance of code.
6. Use a consistent indentation:
The indentation of the code is not consistent, which can make it difficult to read and understand. Consider using a consistent indentation of 4 spaces or using a tool to auto-indent the code.
7. Use a header file:
The code includes the `QMap` header file, but it's not included in a header file. Consider creating a header file for the code and including the necessary headers there.
8. Consider using a more recent version of Qt:
The code uses Qt 5.2, which is an older version. Consider using a more recent version of Qt, which can provide better performance and new features.
