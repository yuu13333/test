 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for variable names and underscore for function names.
2. Add documentation comments:
The code lacks documentation comments for many functions and classes. It's essential to add documentation comments to help other developers understand the code and its purpose.
3. Use const correctness:
In some places, the code modifies objects without a valid reason. For example, in the `TaskMark` constructor, the `m_id` member variable is assigned a value, but it's never modified again. Consider using `const` correctness to ensure that objects are immutable by default.
4. Use C++11/C++14 features:
The code uses some C++03 features, such as `signed/unsigned int` and `bool`. Consider using C++11/C++14 features, such as `int/uint` and `bool` instead.
5. Use consistent indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. Ensure that the indentation is consistent throughout the code to make it easier to read.
6. Use meaningful variable names:
Some variable names, such as `m_instance`, are not very descriptive. Consider using more meaningful variable names to help other developers understand the code's intent.
7. Use exception handling:
The code does not use exception handling. Consider using exceptions to handle unexpected errors and provide more informative error messages.
8. Use constexpr functions:
The code has some functions that can be marked as `constexpr`. Consider using `constexpr` functions to ensure that they can be evaluated at compile-time and provide better performance.
9. Use C++17 features:
The code uses some C++11 features, such as `auto`. Consider using C++17 features, such as `if constexpr` and `std::optional`, to provide better performance and readability.

These are just some suggestions for improvement, and the code generally looks well-structured and easy to read.
