 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to the functions and classes to make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
3. Unused variables: Some variables, such as `m_extraCompilersFutureWatchers`, are not used anywhere in the code. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Compiler warnings: The code uses `QTC_ASSERT` which is not a standard assert macro and might not be supported by all compilers. It's better to use the standard `assert` macro to ensure portability.
5. Unnecessary includes: The code includes some headers that are not necessary for the functionality, such as `<utils/qtcassert.h>`. It's better to remove them to reduce code clutter and improve build times.
6. Missing error handling: The code does not handle errors properly. For example, if `m_generateFutureWatcher.setFuture()` fails, it will not be caught. It's better to add error handling to ensure that the code can handle failures gracefully.
7. Unnecessary complexity: The code uses a complex mechanism to update the project info by using a future watcher and a synchronizer. It's not clear why this complexity is necessary, and it might be possible to simplify the code and improve readability.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and there are no obvious security defects. However, there are some improvements that can be made to make the code more maintainable, readable, and efficient.
