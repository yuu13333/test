 I have analyzed the generated code for security defects, and I did not find any significant security issues. However, I do have a few suggestions for improvement:

1. Input Validation:
In the `buildTree` function (lines 61-87), the `tokenContainers` parameter is not validated. It would be a good idea to check that the parameter is not null or empty before processing it.
2. SQL Injection:
In the `addResultTypeToFunctionSignature` function (lines 102-111), the `name` parameter is concatenated with a query string without proper escaping. This could potentially lead to a SQL injection vulnerability if the `name` parameter is not properly sanitized. It's recommended to use prepared statements or escape special characters in the query string to prevent this type of attack.
3. Information Disclosure:
In the `lineColumnFromIndex` function (lines 218-226), the `sourceIndex` parameter is not validated. It would be a good idea to check that the parameter is not null or invalid before processing it.

Solution:
To fix the security defects, I recommend adding input validation for
