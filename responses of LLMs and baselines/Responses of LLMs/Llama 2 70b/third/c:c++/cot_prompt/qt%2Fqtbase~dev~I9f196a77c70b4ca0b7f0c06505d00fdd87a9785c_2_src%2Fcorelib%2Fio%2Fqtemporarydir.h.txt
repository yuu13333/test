 After analyzing the generated files, I did not detect any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code is quite simple and does not contain any sensitive or critical functionality. Therefore, it is unlikely to have any significant security defects.

Nevertheless, it's always a good practice to keep security in mind when writing code, and to follow best practices such as input validation, error handling, and secure coding guidelines.

In this case, the code is quite straightforward and does not have any obvious security vulnerabilities. Therefore, I would say:

"No security defects are detected in the code."
