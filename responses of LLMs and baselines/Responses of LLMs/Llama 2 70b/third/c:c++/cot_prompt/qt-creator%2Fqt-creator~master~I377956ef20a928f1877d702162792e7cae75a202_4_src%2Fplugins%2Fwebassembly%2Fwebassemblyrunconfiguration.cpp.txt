 After analyzing the generated code, I did not detect any security defects.

However, I would like to mention that the code uses the `eval` function, which can be a potential security risk if used with untrusted input. The `eval` function executes a string as a Python expression, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if used with malicious input.

Line number: 128

Solution:

Instead of using the `eval` function, you can use the `ast` module to parse the input string as an expression and then execute it. Here's an example:
```python
import ast

# Parse the input string as an expression
node = ast.parse(input_string)

# Execute the expression
result = ast.eval(node)
```
By using the `ast` module, you can avoid the security risks associated with the `eval` function.

In summary, while there are no security defects in the code, it's important to be mindful of the potential security risks associated with certain functions, such as `eval`, and take steps to mitigate them.
