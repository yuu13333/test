 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code is quite old (Qt 5.2) and refers to some legacy APIs that are deprecated or removed in newer versions of Qt. It's always a good idea to use the latest version of Qt to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the code doesn't seem to include any security-related headers or libraries, such as OpenSSL or other security frameworks. If your application requires advanced security features, you may need to consider adding additional security-related libraries or frameworks to your project.
