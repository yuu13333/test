 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the performance or maintainability of the code:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. It's generally a good idea to stick to a single convention throughout the code to improve readability and consistency.
2. Unused variables and functions: The code defines several variables and functions that are not used anywhere. For example, the "ucs4lloWorld" function is defined but not called, and the "XString" class is defined but not used. Removing these unused elements can help simplify the code and reduce the risk of errors.
3. Complexity: Some of the functions, such as "insertion_int_intx" and "insertion_string_int2", have complex implementations that may be difficult to understand and maintain. It may be worth considering simplifying these functions or breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
4. Lack of documentation: The code does not include much documentation or comments, which can make it difficult for others to understand what the code does and how it works. Adding comments and documentation can help improve the code's readability and make it easier for others to maintain.

Overall, while the code appears to be secure, addressing these issues could help improve its maintainability and readability.
