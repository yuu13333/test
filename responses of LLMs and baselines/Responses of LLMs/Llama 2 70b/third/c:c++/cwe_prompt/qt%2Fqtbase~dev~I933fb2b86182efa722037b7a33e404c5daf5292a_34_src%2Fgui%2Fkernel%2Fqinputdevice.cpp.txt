 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses the `QMutexLocker` class, which is not a standard C++ class. It is a part of the Qt library and is used to lock mutexes. It is important to ensure that the mutexes are properly locked and unlocked to avoid race conditions and other concurrency issues.

Additionally, the code uses the `QBasicMutex` class, which is also not a standard C++ class. It is a part of the Qt library and is used to implement a basic mutex. It is important to ensure that the mutex is properly locked and unlocked to avoid race conditions and other concurrency issues.

It is also worth noting that the code uses the `qAddPostRoutine` and `qRemovePostRoutine` functions, which are not standard C++ functions. They are a part of the Qt library and are used to add and remove post routines, which are functions that are called after a certain event has occurred. It is important to ensure that these functions are used correctly to avoid any potential issues.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and does not contain any obvious security defects. However, it is important to ensure that the mutexes and post routines are properly used to avoid any potential concurrency issues or other problems.
