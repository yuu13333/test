 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code uses the `QueryPerformanceFrequency` and `QueryPerformanceCounter` functions, which are part of the Windows API. These functions can be vulnerable to attacks that manipulate the system time or compromise the system's ability to accurately measure time.

Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the system time is properly synchronized and that the system is not compromised. Additionally, it's good practice to use a secure clock source, such as a hardware-based clock, to minimize the risk of attacks that manipulate the system time.
