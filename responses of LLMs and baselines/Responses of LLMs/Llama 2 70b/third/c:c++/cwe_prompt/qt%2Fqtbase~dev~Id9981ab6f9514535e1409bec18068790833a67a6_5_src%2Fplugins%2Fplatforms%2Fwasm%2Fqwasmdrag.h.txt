 I have reviewed the code and found a potential security defect.

The defect is related to the use of the `QSimpleDrag` class, which is a part of the Qt library. The `QSimpleDrag` class is vulnerable to a drag-and-drop vulnerability that can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `QSimpleDrag` class does not properly validate the MIME data that is being dragged. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious MIME data that contains executable code, and then using the `QWasmDrag` class to drag and drop the malicious MIME data onto a vulnerable target application.

The corresponding line number of code for this defect is 51, where the `QWasmDrag` class overrides the `drop` method of the `QSimpleDrag` class.

To fix this vulnerability, the `QWasmDrag` class should validate the MIME data being dragged and ensure that it does not contain any executable code. One way to do this is to use the `QMimeData::hasExecutableFiles` method to check if the MIME data contains any executable files. If the MIME data contains executable files, the `QWasmDrag` class should not allow the drop operation to proceed.

Here's an example of how the `QWasmDrag` class can be modified to fix this vulnerability:
```c++
class QWasmDrag : public QSimpleDrag
{
public:
    // ...

    void drop(const QPoint &globalPos, Qt::MouseButtons b, Qt::KeyboardModifiers mods) override
    {
        if (mimeData->hasExecutableFiles()) {
            // Do not allow the drop operation to proceed if the MIME data contains executable files
            return;
        }

        // ...
    }

private:
    // ...
};
```
By adding this check, the `QWasmDrag` class will not allow the drop operation to proceed if the MIME data contains executable files, which can help prevent the execution of arbitrary code on the target system.

In summary, the security defect in the code is the vulnerability arising from the use of the `QSimpleDrag` class, which does not properly validate the MIME data being dragged. The solution is to modify the `QWasmDrag` class to validate the MIME data and prevent the drop operation from proceeding if the MIME data contains executable files.
