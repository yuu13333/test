 I have reviewed the code and found a potential security vulnerability.

Line 61:
```
connect(ToolChainManager::instance(), &ToolChainManager::toolChainRemoved,
                this, &CppProjectUpdater::onToolChainRemoved);
```
The `ToolChainManager::instance()` method returns a pointer to the single instance of the `ToolChainManager` class. However, this instance is not guaranteed to be thread-safe, and it is being accessed from a different thread than the one that created it.

This could lead to a race condition where the `ToolChainManager` instance is deleted before the connection is established, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the `ToolChainManager` instance is thread-safe, or create a thread-safe wrapper around it. Additionally, you should consider using a safer method for connecting signals and slots, such as `QMetaObject::connect` or `QObject::connect`, instead of `connect`ing directly to the instance.

Here's an example of how you could modify the code to fix this issue:
```
QObject::connect(ToolChainManager::instance(), &ToolChainManager::toolChainRemoved,
                 this, &CppProjectUpdater::onToolChainRemoved, Qt::QueuedConnection);
```
This will ensure that the connection is established in a thread-safe manner, and the signal will be delivered to the correct thread.
