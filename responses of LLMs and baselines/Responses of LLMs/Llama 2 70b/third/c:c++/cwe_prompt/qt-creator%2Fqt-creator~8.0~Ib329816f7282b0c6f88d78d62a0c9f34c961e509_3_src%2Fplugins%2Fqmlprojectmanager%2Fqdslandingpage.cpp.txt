 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some member variables are camelCase (e.g., "m_widget"), while others are separate words (e.g., "m_qdsInstalled"). It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of the code, especially in the QdsLandingPageWidget and QdsLandingPage classes, would make it easier for others to understand the code and maintain it.
3. Qt version and QDS version:
The code uses hardcoded strings for Qt version and QDS version. Instead, it's better to define these as constants or use a configuration file to store these values, making it easier to update them without modifying the code.
4. Cmake resources:
The setCmakeResources function takes a QStringList as an argument, but it's not clear what the format of the strings in the list should be. Adding a comment to explain the expected format or providing an example would help users understand how to use this function correctly.
5. Signal-slot connections:
The QdsLandingPage class has several signal-slot connections that are not used anywhere in the code. It's better to remove these unused connections to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
6. qmlRegisterSingletonInstance:
The qmlRegisterSingletonInstance function is used to register a singleton instance of the QdsLandingPage class. However, it's not clear why this is necessary or what the purpose of the "LandingPageApi" string is. Adding a comment to explain the purpose of this line would help others understand the code better.
7. Code organization:
The code is organized into different namespaces, but it's not clear why some functions and variables are in the Internal namespace while others are in the QmlProjectManager namespace. Consolidating related functions and variables into a single namespace would make the code easier to navigate and understand.
8. Utils::transform:
The Utils::transform function is used to transform a list of Utils::FilePaths into a list of QStrings. However, it's not clear what the purpose of this function is or why it's needed. Adding a comment to explain the purpose of this function would help others understand the code better.

These are just suggestions for improvement, and the code generally looks well-structured and easy to read.
