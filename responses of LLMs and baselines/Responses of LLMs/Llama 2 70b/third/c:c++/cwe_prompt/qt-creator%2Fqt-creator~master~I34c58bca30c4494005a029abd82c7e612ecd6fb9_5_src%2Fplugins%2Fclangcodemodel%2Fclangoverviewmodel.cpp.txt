 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's quality and maintainability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. While this is not a security issue, it may lead to confusion and make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally a good idea to follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase.
2. Unused variables and functions:
The code defines some variables and functions that do not seem to be used anywhere. For example, the `addFirstItem` function is never called, and the `TokenTreeItem` constructor takes a `QVector<TokenContainer>` as a parameter, but it is never used. Removing these unused elements can help simplify the code and reduce the risk of errors.
3. Missing documentation:
The code lacks documentation for some functions and variables. Adding documentation can help other developers understand the code's purpose and usage, which can lead to fewer errors and improvements in overall code quality.
4. Compiler warnings:
The code may generate some compiler warnings, such as "unused variable" or "unused function." While these warnings do not necessarily indicate security issues, addressing them can help improve the code's quality and reduce the risk of errors.
5. Non-const correctness:
The `buildTree` function modifies the `tokenContainers` parameter, which is a non-const reference. Modifying a non-const reference can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs. It's generally a good idea to use const references when possible to ensure that the code is thread-safe and less prone to errors.
6. Missing return statements:
Some functions, such as `addResultTypeToFunctionSignature` and `addTypeToVariableName`, do not have a return statement. While the code may still compile and work correctly, adding return statements can help make the code more readable and maintainable.
7. Redundant code:
The `OverviewModel::rebuild` function seems to have redundant code. The `m_filePath` variable is assigned a new value, but the previous value is never used again. Similarly, the `connect` and `disconnect` calls seem to be redundant. Removing this redundant code can help simplify the code and reduce the risk of errors.
8. Unnecessary includes:
The code includes some headers that do not seem to be necessary, such as `<cplusplus/Icons.h>`. Removing unnecessary includes can help reduce the code's size and improve build times.

Again, these are minor issues that do not directly impact security but can still improve the code's quality and maintainability.
