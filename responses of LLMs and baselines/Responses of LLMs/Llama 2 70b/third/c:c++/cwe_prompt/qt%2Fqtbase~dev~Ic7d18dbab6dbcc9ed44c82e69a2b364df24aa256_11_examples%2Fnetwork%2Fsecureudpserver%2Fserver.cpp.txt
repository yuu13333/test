 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of each function, class, and variable.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions, such as `serverConfiguration` and `readyRead`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and make the code more maintainable.
4. Complicated logic:
The code has some complicated logic, such as the handshake process, which can be difficult to understand and maintain. It's better to break down the logic into smaller, more manageable functions.
5. Lack of error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly. It's better to add proper error handling and reporting mechanisms to ensure that the code can recover gracefully from errors and provide useful information to the user.
6. Use of `Q_ASSERT`:
The code uses `Q_ASSERT` in some places, which can be problematic in release builds. It's better to use `assert` instead, which will provide better debug information.
7. Use of `QStringLiteral`:
The code uses `QStringLiteral` to create string literals. While this is not wrong, it's better to use `QString` directly and avoid the overhead of creating a temporary string object.
8. Use of `QByteArray`:
The code uses `QByteArray` to store binary data. While this is not wrong, it's better to use `std::vector<uint8_t>` instead, which is more efficient and easier to work with.
9. Use of `quint16`:
The code uses `quint16` to represent port numbers. While this is not wrong, it's better to use `uint16_t` instead, which is the standard type for port numbers.
10. Use of `QSslPreSharedKeyAuthenticator`:
The code uses `QSslPreSharedKeyAuthenticator` to handle PSK authentication. While this is not wrong, it's better to use `QSslCertificate` instead, which provides more flexibility and control over the authentication process.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, but there is room for improvement in terms of readability, maintainability, and security.
