 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to explain the purpose and usage of the various functions, classes, and variables. This would make the code easier to understand and maintain.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code defines some variables and functions that are not used anywhere. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Complicated shutdown process:
The shutdown process of the DeviceShell class seems complicated, with multiple calls to closeShellProcess() and waitForFinished(). It may be better to simplify the process by combining these calls into a single function.
5. Use of QMetaObject::invokeMethod():
The code uses QMetaObject::invokeMethod() to call functions on the GUI thread. However, this approach can lead to performance issues and is generally discouraged. Instead, consider using a queued connection or moving the code to the GUI thread using QThreadPool.
6. Use of QtcProcess:
The code uses QtcProcess, which is a part of the QtCreator module. It's not clear why this class is used instead of the standard QProcess class. If there's a specific reason for using QtcProcess, it should be documented.
7. Missing error handling:
The code does not handle errors properly. For example, if the shell process fails to start, the code will crash. It's better to handle such errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
8. Use of QThread::currentThread():
The code uses QThread::currentThread() to check whether the code is running on the GUI thread. However, this approach
