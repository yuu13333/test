 The code you provided is a Qt class that implements an HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy. It has a few member functions and member variables that are used to set and retrieve the policy's host, expiration date, and subdomain inclusion status.

Upon reviewing the code, I did not find any obvious security defects. However, I do have a few suggestions for improvements:

1. Use const correctness:
The `QHstsPolicy` class has a few member functions that can be declared as const, which would make the code more thread-safe and reduce the risk of accidental modifications to the object. For example, the `host()` and `expiry()` functions can be declared as const.
2. Use C++11/C++14 style casts:
The code uses C-style casts in some places, which can be replaced with C++11/C++14 style casts for better readability and safety. For example, instead of `qSwap(d, other.d);`, you can use `std::swap(d, other.d);`.
3. Use a more secure initialization method:
The `QHstsPolicy` class has a default constructor that initializes the object with an empty host name and an expiration date that is not set. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the object is used without being properly initialized. Consider adding a constructor that takes a host name and an expiration date as parameters, and initializes the object with those values.
4. Add a check for invalid host names:
The `setHost()` function does not check if the host name is valid or not. Consider adding a check to ensure that the host name is not empty and does not contain any invalid characters.
5. Add a check for invalid expiration dates:
The `setExpiry()` function does not check if the expiration date is valid or not. Consider adding a check to ensure that the expiration date is not in the past.
6. Use a more secure comparison method:
The `operator==()` function compares two `QHstsPolicy` objects by comparing their member variables directly. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the objects are not properly synchronized. Consider using a more secure comparison method, such as comparing the objects' hash values or using a comparison function that takes into account the objects' expiration dates.

Overall, the code looks well-written, and I did not find any major security defects. However, following these best practices can improve the code's security and stability.
