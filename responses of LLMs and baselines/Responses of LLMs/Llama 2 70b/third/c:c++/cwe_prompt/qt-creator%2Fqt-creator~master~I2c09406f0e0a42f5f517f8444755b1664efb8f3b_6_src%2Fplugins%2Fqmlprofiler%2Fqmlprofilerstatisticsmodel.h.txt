 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few potential improvements that could enhance the code's security:

1. Use const correctness:
In function definitions, consider using "const" for function parameters and local variables when they don't need to be modified. This can prevent unintended changes to data and improve code stability.
2. Use C++11/C++14/C++17 features:
The codebase uses C++98, which is an outdated standard. Consider upgrading to a newer standard, such as C++11, C++14, or C++17, to take advantage of new features and improvements.
3. Use a consistent coding style:
The codebase uses both Google and LLVM coding styles. It's better to choose one style and stick to it consistently throughout the codebase to improve readability and maintainability.
4. Use meaningful variable names:
Some variable names, such as "m_rootDuration," could be more descriptive. Consider using variable names that clearly convey their purpose to make the code easier to understand and maintain.
5. Avoid redundant code:
The codebase has some redundant code, such as the "dataAvailable" and "notesAvailable" signals, which have the same functionality. Consider removing the redundant code to simplify the codebase and reduce maintenance effort.
6. Use static analysis tools:
Consider using static analysis tools, such as Valgrind or AddressSanitizer, to detect memory leaks, null pointer dereferences, and other issues that may not be caught by the compiler.
7. Use a memory safety tool:
Consider using a memory safety tool, such as the AddressSanitizer, to detect memory safety issues, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and other memory-related vulnerabilities.
8. Use a secure coding practice:
When handling user data, consider using a secure coding practice, such as using QVector instead of std::vector, to prevent buffer overflows and other memory-related vulnerabilities.

These are just some suggestions for improving the code's security and quality. However, a thorough security assessment should be performed by a security expert to identify potential vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for mitigation.
