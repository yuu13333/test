 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses the `qFatal` function, which is not a standard C++ function and is specific to the Qt library. It is not immediately clear what the function does or how it differs from other fatal error handling functions like `std::terminate` or `std::abort`. It would be beneficial to include a comment explaining the purpose of the `qFatal` function and why it is used instead of other alternatives.

Additionally, the code uses the `QString` class for handling strings, which is part of the Qt library. While there is nothing inherently wrong with using `QString`, it is worth noting that the standard C++ library provides a similar class called `std::string` that can be used instead. Using `std::string` would make the code more compatible with other C++ projects and libraries that do not use Qt.

Lastly, the code includes the `QRegExp` class, which is also part of the Qt library. While regular expressions can be useful for parsing and validating text, they can also introduce security vulnerabilities if used incorrectly. It is important to ensure that the regular expressions used in the code are properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential security issues.
