 I have reviewed the code and found no security defects. The code adheres to best practices for secure coding, and there are no obvious vulnerabilities.

Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement, though they do not necessarily relate to security:

1. Consistent naming conventions would make the code easier to read. For example, the variable "d_ptr" could be renamed to "privateData" or "dataPtr" for improved readability.
2. The class documentation could benefit from more detail. A brief description of the class's purpose, its methods, and their intended use would help developers understand how to use the class effectively.
3. The method "QTemporaryDir::operator=(QTemporaryDir &&other)" could be marked as "noexcept" to indicate that it does not throw exceptions.
4. The method "QTemporaryDir::remove()" could be documented with a brief description of its purpose and behavior.
5. The class could benefit from additional member functions or methods to make it more versatile and user-friendly. For example, a method to create a temporary directory with a specified name or a method to retrieve the directory's path could be useful.
6. The code uses the "QScopedPointer" class, which is not explicitly mentioned in the code. It would be beneficial to include a comment or a reference to the relevant documentation to explain the purpose of this class and its usage.
7. The code includes the "QDir" class, but it is not used anywhere. It could be removed to simplify the code and reduce dependencies.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written, and I found no security defects. With some minor improvements, it could be even more readable and maintainable.
