 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses some deprecated APIs, such as `QMetaObject::QSlotObjectBase` and `QThread::sleep()`. It's recommended to use the newer versions of these APIs to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Qt.

Additionally, the code uses `QCache` and `QMutex` which are not thread-safe, it's recommended to use `QThreadSafeCache` and `QMutexLocker` instead to ensure thread-safety.

It's also worth mentioning that the code uses `QElapsedTimer` which is not the best choice for measuring elapsed time, as it's not very accurate and can be affected by system clock changes. Instead, you can use `QHighResolutionTimer` or `QStopWatch` for more accurate measurements.

It's also worth mentioning that the code uses `QSharedPointer` which is not the best choice for sharing pointers between threads, as it's not thread-safe. Instead, you can use `QMutexLocker` to ensure thread-safety when sharing pointers.

Please note that this is just a review of the code and not a security audit, it's always a good idea to perform a security audit on any code before using it in production.
