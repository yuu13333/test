 I have identified several potential security defects in the given code:

1. Improper Access Control (CWE-284):
In line 115, the code sends a sub-auth type of `X509NONE` to the server without proper authorization. This could allow unauthorized access to the system, as the `X509NONE` sub-auth type does not provide any authentication.
2. Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities (CWE-435):
In line 137, the code establishes a TLS connection with the server using the `ssl.wrap_socket()` function. However, the code does not check the server's certificate against a trusted certificate authority, which could lead to a man-in-the-middle attack.
3. Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime (CWE-664):
In line 141, the code sets the `cert_reqs` parameter of the `ssl.wrap_socket()` function to `ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`, which means that the server's certificate must be verified. However, the code does not provide a mechanism to ensure that the server's certificate is valid and up-to-date, which could lead to a security vulnerability.
4. Incorrect Calculation (CWE-682):
In line 144, the code sets the `ssl_version` parameter of the `ssl.wrap_socket()` function to `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2`. However, this value is not a valid TLS version and may cause the connection to fail.
5. Insufficient Control Flow Management (CWE-691):
In line 147, the code catches an `ssl.SSLError` exception and raises an `exception.RFBAuthHandshakeFailed` exception with a generic error message. However, the code does not provide enough information to diagnose the problem, which could lead to difficulties in troubleshooting and debugging.
6. Protection Mechanism Failure (CWE-693):
In line 145, the code uses the `ssl.wrap_socket()` function to establish a TLS connection with the server. However, the code does not provide a mechanism to ensure that the TLS connection is properly terminated, which could lead to a security vulnerability.
7. Incorrect Comparison (CWE-703):
In line 123, the code compares the result of the `ord()` function call to 0, which is not a valid comparison. The code should compare the result to a constant value, such as ` AuthVeNCryptSubtype.X509NONE`.
8. Improper Neutralization (CWE-707):
In line 116, the code sends a sub-auth type of `X509NONE` to the server without proper neutralization. This could lead to a security vulnerability if the server does not properly sanitize the input.
9. Improper Adherence to Coding Standards (CWE-710):
The code does not follow proper coding standards, such as using consistent indentation and spacing, which could make the code difficult to read and understand.

To fix these security defects, I recommend the following:

1. Add proper authorization to the sub-auth type selection, such as using a secure random number generator to generate a unique sub-auth type for each connection.
2. Check the server's certificate against a trusted certificate authority to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
3. Provide a mechanism to ensure that the server's certificate is valid and up-to-date, such as using a certificate revocation list (CRL) or online certificate status protocol (OCSP) stapling.
4. Use a valid TLS version, such as `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2`, and ensure that the connection is properly terminated.
5. Provide enough information in error messages to diagnose the problem, such as including the specific error message and the server's certificate.
6. Use consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.
