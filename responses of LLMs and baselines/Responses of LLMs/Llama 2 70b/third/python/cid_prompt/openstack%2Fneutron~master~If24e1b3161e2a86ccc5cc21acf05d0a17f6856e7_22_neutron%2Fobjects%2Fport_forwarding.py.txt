 I have reviewed the code and found a few potential security defects:

1. CWE-284: Improper Access Control

In the `modify_fields_from_db` method, the `socket` field is being modified based on the `internal_ip_address` and `internal_port` fields. However, there is no check to ensure that the `socket` field is not modified by an unauthorized user. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the `socket` field and gain unauthorized access to the system.

2. CWE-435: Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities

In the `get_port_forwarding_obj_by_routers` method, there is a join operation between the `PortForwarding` model and the `FloatingIP` model. However, there is no check to ensure that the `FloatingIP` model is properly associated with the `PortForwarding` model. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the `FloatingIP` model and gain unauthorized access to the system.

3. CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime

In the `from_db_object` method, the `FIP_OBJ` attribute is being set to a new instance of the `FloatingIP` model. However, there is no check to ensure that the `FIP_OBJ` attribute is properly cleaned up when it is no longer needed. This could potentially lead to a resource leak and allow an attacker to manipulate the system.

4. CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation

In the `modify_fields_to_db` method, the `socket` field is being calculated based on the `internal_ip_address` and `internal_port` fields. However, there is no check to ensure that the calculation is correct. This could potentially lead to an incorrect calculation and allow an attacker to manipulate the system.

5. CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management

In the `PortForwarding` class, there are several methods that are marked as `@classmethod`, but they are not being used anywhere in the code. This could potentially lead to a situation where an attacker could manipulate the system by calling these methods directly.

6. CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure

In the `modify_fields_from_db` method, there is a check to ensure that the `socket` field is not modified by an unauthorized user. However, this check is not sufficient, as an attacker could potentially bypass it by manipulating the `internal_ip_address` and `internal_port` fields.

7. CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison

In the `modify_fields_to_db` method, there is a check to ensure that the `internal_ip_address` and `internal_port` fields are not None. However, this check is not sufficient, as an attacker could potentially manipulate the `internal_ip_address` and `internal_port` fields to be None, allowing them to bypass the check.

8. CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions

In the `from_db_object` method, there is no check to ensure that the `FIP_OBJ` attribute is properly handled when an exception is raised. This could potentially lead to an attacker manipulating the system by raising an exception and exploiting the lack of proper handling.

9. CWE-707: Improper Neutralization

In the `modify_fields_from_db` method, there is no check to ensure that the `socket` field is properly neutralized. This could potentially lead to an attacker manipulating the system by injecting malicious input into the `socket` field.

10. CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards

The code contains several coding standards violations, such as missing docstrings, missing type hints, and inconsistent naming conventions. This could potentially lead to confusion and errors in the code, allowing an attacker to manipulate the system.

To address these security defects, it is recommended to:

1. Add proper access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can modify the `socket` field.
2. Implement proper interaction between the `PortForwarding` and `FloatingIP` models, such as using a foreign key constraint.
3. Properly clean up the `FIP_OBJ` attribute when it is no longer needed.
4. Implement proper calculation checks to ensure that the `socket` field is correctly calculated.
5. Remove the unused methods or implement proper usage checks to prevent manipulation by attackers.
6. Implement proper protection mechanism checks to ensure that the `socket` field is not modified by an unauthorized user.
7. Implement proper comparison checks to ensure that the `internal_ip_address` and `internal_port` fields are not None.
8. Implement proper exception handling to ensure that the `FIP_OBJ` attribute is properly handled when an exception is raised.
9. Implement proper neutralization checks to ensure that the `socket` field is properly neutralized.
10. Follow proper coding standards to ensure that the code is clear, consistent, and easy to understand.

No security defects are detected in the code.
