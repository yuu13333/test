 I have reviewed the code for security defects, and I have found one potential issue.

The issue is related to the use of the `tempfile` module and the creation of a temporary configuration file. The file is created with the `NamedTemporaryFile` class, which creates a file with a unique name in the system's temporary directory. However, the file is not automatically deleted when it goes out of scope, which means that it can remain on the system even after the test has finished running.

This can lead to a security issue if the temporary file contains sensitive information, such as login credentials or encryption keys. An attacker could potentially access the file and extract the sensitive information, which could be used to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the temporary file is properly deleted after it is no longer needed. You can do this by adding a `finally` block that deletes the file when the test finishes running. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to fix this issue:
```python
import tempfile

# ...

class WSGIAppTest(base.BaseTestCase):
    # ...

    def setUp(self):
        # ...

        self.conf = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+t')
        self.conf.write(self._paste_config.lstrip())
        self.conf.seek(0)
        self.conf.flush()

        # Add a finally block to delete the file when the test finishes running
        finally:
            self.conf.close()
            os.unlink(self.conf.name)

    # ...
```
By adding the `finally` block, you ensure that the temporary file is properly deleted when the test finishes running, which helps to prevent potential security issues.

In summary, the security defect in the code is the lack of proper cleanup of the temporary configuration file, which can lead to sensitive information being exposed to unauthorized users. The solution is to add a `finally` block that deletes the file when the test finishes running.
