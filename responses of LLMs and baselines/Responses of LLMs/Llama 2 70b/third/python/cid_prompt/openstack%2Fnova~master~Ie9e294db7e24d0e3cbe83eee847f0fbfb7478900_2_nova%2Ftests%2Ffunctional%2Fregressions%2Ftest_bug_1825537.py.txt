 I have reviewed the code for security defects, and I have found one potential issue:

1. CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation

The issue is related to the calculation of resource provider allocations in the `test_finish_resize_fails_allocation_cleanup` method. Specifically, the `self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation` method is called twice, but the second call is using the wrong flavor ID.

The first call to `self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation` is using the correct flavor ID (`self.flavor2`), but the second call is using the old flavor ID (`self.flavor1`). This means that the second call is checking the allocations for the wrong flavor, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, you should update the second call to `self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation` to use the correct flavor ID (`self.flavor2`). The corrected code should look like this:
```python
self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation(
    self.flavor2, server['id'], dest_rp_uuid)
```
Additionally, I would recommend adding a comment to explain the reasoning behind the assertion, to make the code more readable and maintainable.

Here's the updated code with the fix applied:
```python
13 from nova.tests.functional import integrated_helpers

16 class FinishResizeErrorAllocationCleanupTestCase(
17         integrated_helpers.ProviderUsageBaseTestCase):
