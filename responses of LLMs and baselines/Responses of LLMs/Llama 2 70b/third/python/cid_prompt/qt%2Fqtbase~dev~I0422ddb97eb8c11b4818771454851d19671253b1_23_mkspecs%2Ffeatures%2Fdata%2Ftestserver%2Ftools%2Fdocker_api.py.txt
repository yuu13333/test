 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings: Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. Adding docstrings would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused variables: The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `maintainer` in the `DockerConfig` class. It's better to remove unused variables to avoid confusion and reduce code maintenance.
4. Unnecessary imports: The code imports some modules that are not used, such as `tools.utility`. It's better to remove unnecessary imports to reduce code clutter.
5. Missing error handling: Some functions, such as `docker_build` and `docker_run`, call other functions that may raise errors, but they do not handle those errors appropriately. It's better to add error handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks, to ensure that the code can handle unexpected errors gracefully.
6. Unclear variable names: Some variable names, such as `server` and `config`, are not descriptive enough to understand their purpose. It's better to use more descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
7. Unnecessary comments: Some comments, such as the one in line 155, are not necessary and can be removed. Comments should only be used to explain complex code or provide additional information that is not already obvious from the code.
8. Missing blank lines: The code lacks blank lines between functions, which can make the code harder to read. Adding blank lines between functions can improve code readability and organization.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and the security defects are minimal. However, following best practices and addressing the suggestions above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security.
