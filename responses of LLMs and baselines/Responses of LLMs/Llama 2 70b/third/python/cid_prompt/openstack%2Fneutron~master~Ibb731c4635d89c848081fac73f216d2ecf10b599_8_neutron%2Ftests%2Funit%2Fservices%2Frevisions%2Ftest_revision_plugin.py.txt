 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code indentation is not consistent, and some lines are too long, making them difficult to read. It's recommended to follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code, which suggests a maximum line length of 79 characters and consistent indentation. Additionally, some of the test methods are quite long and complex, which may make them difficult to understand and maintain. It's a good practice to break down long methods into smaller ones to improve readability and maintainability.
