 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable and function names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable definitions. This will make the code easier to understand and help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
Adding docstrings to functions and classes can help provide context and explain the purpose of the code. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
4. Code organization:
The code is organized into several modules, but some modules have a large number of functions and variables. Consider breaking down the modules into smaller, more focused modules to improve code organization and readability.
5. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are short and cryptic. Try to use descriptive and meaningful names for all functions, so the code is easier to understand and maintain.
6. Code style:
Consider using a consistent code style throughout the code. For example, you can use consistent indentation, spacing, and formatting for functions, variables, and control flow statements.
7. Comments:
Adding comments to the code can help explain complex logic and provide context. Consider adding comments to the code where necessary, especially in areas that may be difficult to understand.
8. Testing:
The code seems to lack testing. Consider adding tests to the code to ensure it functions correctly and to catch bugs early in development.

Overall, the code seems well-structured, and the security defects I mentioned are minor and do not pose a significant risk to the code's security. However, addressing these suggestions can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality.
