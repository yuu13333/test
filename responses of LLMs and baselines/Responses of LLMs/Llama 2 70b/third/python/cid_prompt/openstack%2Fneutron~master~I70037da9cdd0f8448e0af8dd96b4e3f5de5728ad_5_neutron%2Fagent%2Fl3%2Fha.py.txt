 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues with the code:

1. Inconsistent indentation: In some places, the indentation is not consistent, which can make the code harder to read. For example, in the `enqueue_state_change` function, the `if` statement has four spaces of indentation, while the `else` statement has six spaces. It's better to be consistent with the indentation throughout the code.
2. Unused variables: The `eventlet.sleep(0)` function call in the `_enqueue_state_change` function is not necessary and can be removed. Also, the `transition_state_mutex` variable is not used anywhere in the code. It's better to remove unused variables to avoid confusion and make the code more maintain
