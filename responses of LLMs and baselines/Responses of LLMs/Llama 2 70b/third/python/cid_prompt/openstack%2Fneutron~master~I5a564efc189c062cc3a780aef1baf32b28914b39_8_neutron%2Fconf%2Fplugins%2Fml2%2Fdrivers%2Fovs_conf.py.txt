 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses some deprecated options and features, such as the 'prevent_arp_spoofing' option, which is deprecated and will be removed in Ocata. It is recommended to remove this option and use the port security extension instead.

Additionally, the 'drop_flows_on_start' option is set to False by default, which may cause brief traffic interruption when the agent starts. It is recommended to set this option to True to avoid any potential issues.

Finally, the 'tunnel_csum' option is set to False by default, which may cause issues with tunnel header checksum. It is recommended to set this option to True to ensure that the tunnel header checksum is properly set.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, it is important to address these deprecated features and options to ensure the stability and security of the system.
