 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's a good practice to use type hints and annotations for all function parameters and return types to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Function docstrings:
Some functions lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions to make the code more readable and understandable.
4. Consistency in indentation and spacing:
The code uses inconsistent indentation and spacing, which can make it difficult to read and understand. It's better to use consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code.
5. Comments:
The code has very few comments. It's a good practice to include comments that describe the purpose of the code, its functionality, and any assumptions or constraints. This will make the code more readable and understandable.
6. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors and exceptions properly. It's a good practice to include try-except blocks and handle errors and exceptions appropriately, especially when interacting with external systems or APIs.
7. Security:
The code doesn't have any obvious security vulnerabilities, but it's always a good practice to follow security best practices, such as input validation, secure communication, and secure data storage.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there are some areas where improvements can be made to enhance readability, maintainability, and security.
