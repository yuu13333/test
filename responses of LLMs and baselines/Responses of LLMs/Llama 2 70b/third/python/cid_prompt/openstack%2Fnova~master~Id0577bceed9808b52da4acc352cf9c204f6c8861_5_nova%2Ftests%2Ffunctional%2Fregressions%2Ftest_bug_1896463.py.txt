 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use snake_case. It is best to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
Some functions and variables lack type hints and annotations, making it difficult to understand their intended purpose and type. Adding type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
3. Docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. Adding docstrings can help provide context and make the code easier to understand.
4. Comments:
Some parts of the code have comments that are not clear or descriptive enough. Good comments should describe what the code is doing, why it is doing it, and any assumptions or edge cases that need consideration.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple files, but some functions and classes are quite long, making it difficult to read and understand. Consider breaking down long functions and classes into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve code organization and readability.
6. Testing:
The code uses the `unittest` module for testing, which is a good start. However, some tests could be improved by adding more assertions and edge cases to ensure that the code behaves correctly in various scenarios. Additionally, consider adding documentation to the tests to explain what they are testing and why.
7. Code style:
Some code style issues, such as inconsistent indentation and spacing, can make the code harder to read. Consider using a consistent code style and enforcing it throughout the codebase using tools like flake8 or pylint.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and the use of fixtures and mocks in the test cases is well done. However, paying attention to the suggestions above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality.
