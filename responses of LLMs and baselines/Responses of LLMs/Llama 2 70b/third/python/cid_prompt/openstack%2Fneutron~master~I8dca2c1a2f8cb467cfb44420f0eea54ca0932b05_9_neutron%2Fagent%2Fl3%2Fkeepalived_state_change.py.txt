 I have reviewed the code and found a few potential security defects. Here are my findings:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
In the `MonitorDaemon` class, the `run` method starts two threads: `_thread_ip_monitor` and `_thread_read_queue`. However, the `queue` object is not properly protected, and any thread can access and modify it. This could lead to a situation where a malicious thread could intercept and modify the messages in the queue, potentially causing the daemon to behave unexpectedly.

To fix this issue, you should consider using a thread-safe data structure, such as a `queue.Queue` object, and ensure that access to the queue is properly synchronized.

2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
In the `MonitorDaemon` class, the `send_garp` method sends a gratuitous ARP message to the IP address of a new router interface. However, the method does not properly handle the case where the IP address is not an IPv4 address. This could lead to a situation where the daemon sends a garbled message, potentially causing issues with the network.

To fix this issue, you should consider using a library that can properly handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, such as the `ipaddress` library.

3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
In the `MonitorDaemon` class, the `handle_initial_state` method sets the `state` variable to either 'master' or 'backup', depending on the current state of the router interface. However, the variable is not properly initialized, and it is not cleared when the daemon shuts down. This could lead to a situation where the daemon leaves behind a stale state file, potentially causing issues with the network.

To fix this issue, you should consider properly initializing the `state` variable in the constructor, and ensuring that it is properly cleared in the `handle_sigterm` method.

4. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
In the `MonitorDaemon` class, the `read_queue` method has a potential infinite loop, where it waits for messages in the queue indefinitely. This could lead to a situation where the daemon consumes excessive resources, potentially causing issues with the network.

To fix this issue, you should consider adding a timeout to the `read_queue` method, so that it does not block indefinitely.

5. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
In the `MonitorDaemon` class, the `send_garp` method uses the `ip_lib.send_ip_addr_adv_notif` function to send a gratuitous ARP message. However, the function does not properly check whether the IP address is a valid IP address. This could lead to a situation where the daemon sends a garbled message, potentially causing issues with the network.

To fix this issue, you should consider using a library that can properly validate IP addresses, such as the `ipaddress` library.

6. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
In the `MonitorDaemon` class, the `handle_initial_state` method compares the current state of the router interface to either 'master' or 'backup'. However, the comparison is done using a string comparison, which is not proper. This could lead to a situation where the daemon misinterprets the state of the router interface, potentially causing issues with the network.

To fix this issue, you should consider using a proper comparison method, such as `str.startswith`, to compare the state of the router interface.

7. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
In the `MonitorDaemon` class, the `send_garp` method does not properly handle exceptions. This could lead to a situation where the daemon does not properly handle errors, potentially causing issues with the network.

To fix this issue, you should consider adding proper exception handling to the `send_garp` method, so that it can properly handle errors and take appropriate action.

8. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
In the `MonitorDaemon` class, the `send_garp` method uses the `ip_lib.send_ip_addr_adv_notif` function to send a gratuitous ARP message. However, the function does not properly neutralize the input data, potentially leading to a situation where the daemon sends a garbled message, potentially causing issues with the network.

To fix this issue, you should consider using a library that can properly neutralize input data, such as the `ipaddress` library.

9. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
In the `MonitorDaemon` class, there are several instances of non-compliance with coding standards. For example, the method names are not properly capitalized, and there are inconsistent spacing and indentation. This could lead to a situation where the code is difficult to read and understand, potentially causing issues with the network.

To fix this issue, you should consider adhering to proper coding standards, such as the PEP 8 style guide, to ensure that the code is easy to read and understand.

In summary, I have identified several potential security defects in the code, including improper access control, improper interaction between multiple entities, improper control of a resource through its lifetime, insufficient control flow management, protection mechanism failure, incorrect comparison, improper check or handling of exceptional conditions, improper neutralization, and improper adherence to coding standards. To address these issues, you should consider implementing the recommended fixes and best practices to ensure that the code is secure and reliable.
