 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I want to emphasize that this code review focused on identifying potential security vulnerabilities. It's essential to remember that security assessments involve multiple components, such as configuration, network setup, and deployment settings.

It's crucial to consider the broader security context when evaluating the security of a system. It's advisable to conduct an extensive security assessment, including penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and configuration reviews, to ensure the system's comprehensive security.

I hope you find this information helpful. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
