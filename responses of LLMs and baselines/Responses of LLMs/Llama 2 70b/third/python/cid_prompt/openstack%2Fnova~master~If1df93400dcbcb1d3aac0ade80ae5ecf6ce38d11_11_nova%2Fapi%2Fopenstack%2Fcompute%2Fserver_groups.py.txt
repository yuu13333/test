 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, it's worth mentioning that this codebase is quite old (2014), and some of the practices and libraries used may not be up-to-date or considered secure nowadays. For example, the use of the "wsgi" module and the "nova" library may not be considered best practice in modern Python development.

Additionally, there are some minor issues with the code organization and formatting that could be improved. For example, there are several long lines that could be broken up for better readability, and some inconsistent spacing and indentation throughout the code.

Overall, while there don't appear to be any glaring security issues in this codebase, it may still benefit from a review and update to modern best practices and libraries.
