 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent coding style:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable and function names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses Python 2.7, which doesn't have built-in type hints and annotations. However, it's a good practice to add type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable definitions. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
The code has very few docstrings. It's a good practice to add docstrings for functions, classes, and modules. This helps in understanding the purpose and usage of the code.
4. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are short and not very descriptive. It's a good practice to use descriptive and meaningful function names that clearly convey what the function does.
5. Code organization:
The code has a mix of test case classes, fixtures, and utility functions. It's a good practice to organize the code into separate modules or classes for better maintainability and readability.
6. Code reuse:
The code has some duplicate code in the `setUp` method and the `test_live_migrate_one_multi_created_instance` method. It's a good practice to extract the common code into a separate method and reuse it where necessary.
7. Error handling:
The code has a few places where it catches and logs exceptions without re-raising them. It's a good practice to re-raise the exceptions, especially in test cases, so that the issues are properly reported and addressed.
8. Test naming:
The test case names are not very descriptive. It's a good practice to use descriptive test case names that clearly convey what the test case is testing.
9. Test scope:
The test cases are testing multiple scenarios, which makes the tests less focused and harder to understand. It's a good practice to break down the tests into smaller, focused test cases that test a single scenario or feature.
10. Test assertions:
The test cases have limited assertions, which makes it difficult to ensure that the test cases are properly testing the expected behavior. It's a good practice to add more assertions to ensure that the test cases are comprehensive and cover all expected scenarios.
