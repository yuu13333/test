 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Comments: Some of the comments are not very clear or descriptive. For example, the comment for the `is_systemd()` function does not explain what the function does or why it's necessary. It's better to write comments that clearly explain the purpose and behavior of the code.
3. Error handling: The code does not handle errors very well. For example, if the `mount_volume()` function fails to mount the volume, it will raise an exception without providing any useful information. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, such as logging the error and providing a useful error message.
4. Security: While there are no security defects in the code, it's worth noting that the code does not perform any authentication or authorization checks. If the code is intended to be used in a production environment, it should be modified to perform appropriate security checks to ensure that only authorized users can access the Quobyte volume.
5. Code organization: The code is quite long and complex, with many interdependent functions. It's better to break the code into smaller, more manageable functions and modules to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Testing: The code does not include any unit tests or integration tests. It's important to write tests to ensure that the code functions correctly and to catch any bugs or errors before they cause problems in production.
