 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
3. docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for the functions, classes, and variables. Adding docstrings can help provide context and make the code easier to understand.
4. Error handling:
The code catches SSL.SSLError but doesn't handle other possible exceptions that may occur during the handshake process. Consider catching and handling other exceptions, such as socket.error, ssl.CertificateExpiredError, ssl.CertificateNotValidError, etc.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to maintain and read. Consider breaking the code into smaller modules or classes to improve organization and reusability.
6. Security considerations:
The code uses a hardcoded list of supported VeNCrypt sub-auth types. Consider using a configuration file or a dynamic mechanism to specify the supported sub-auth types, to make the code more flexible and secure.
7. Code style:
The code uses both spaces and tabs for indentation, which can make the code harder to read. Consider using a consistent indentation style throughout the code.
8. Comments:
The code has inconsistent comment styles and some comments are not clear. Consider using clear and concise comments that describe the purpose of the code, and avoid using redundant comments that repeat the code.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, but following these best practices can improve its readability, maintainability, and security.
