 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's better to add type hints and annotations for all function parameters, return types, and variable declarations to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for most functions, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and parameters of each function. It's better to add docstrings for all functions to provide context and make the code more understandable.
4. Function signature:
The `connect` function takes two parameters, `tenant_sock` and `compute_sock`, but their types are not specified. It's better to specify the types of these parameters to make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Error handling:
The code catches generic exceptions like `Exception` and logs the error message without providing any context. It's better to catch specific exceptions and provide context-specific error messages to make the code more informative and helpful.
6. Consistent indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to ensure consistent indentation throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
7. Unused imports:
The code imports `six` and `logging`, but they are not used anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid clutter and make the code more maintainable.
8. Redundant imports:
The code imports `auth` and `auths` from the same package. It's better to remove the redundant import and use the same import statement for both.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and I didn't find any glaring security defects. However, following best practices for code organization, readability, and maintainability can make the code more reliable and easier to understand.
