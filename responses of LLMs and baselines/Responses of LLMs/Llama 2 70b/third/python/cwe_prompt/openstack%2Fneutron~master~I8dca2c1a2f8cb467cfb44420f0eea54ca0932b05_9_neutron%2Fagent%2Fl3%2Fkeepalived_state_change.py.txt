 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's reliability or performance:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this does not affect the code's functionality, it may make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally a good idea to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. Adding docstrings can make the code more readable and easier to understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with the code in the future.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports some modules that are not used anywhere, such as `httplib2` and `six.moves`. It's a good practice to remove unused imports to minimize the risk of introducing unnecessary dependencies and potential security vulnerabilities.
4. Unnecessary complexity:
The code has a complex structure with multiple threads and queues, which may make it difficult to understand and maintain. It's worth considering whether this complexity is necessary and whether the code could be simplified or refactored to improve its readability and maintainability.
5. Missing error handling:
The code does not handle some errors and exceptions properly. For example, in the `send_garp` function, there is no error handling for the `send_ip_addr_adv_notif` function. If this function fails, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Adding proper error handling and logging can help identify and debug issues more effectively.
6. Hardcoded values:
The code has some hardcoded values, such as the IP address `127.0.0.1` and the namespace `default`. It's generally a good practice to avoid hardcoding values and instead use configurable parameters or environment variables to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

Again, these are not direct security defects, but addressing these issues can improve the code's overall quality and reliability.
