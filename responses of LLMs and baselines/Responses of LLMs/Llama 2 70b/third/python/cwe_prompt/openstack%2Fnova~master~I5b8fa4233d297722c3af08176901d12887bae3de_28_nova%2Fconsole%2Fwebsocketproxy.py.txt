 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent indentation: The indentation in the code is not consistent, which can make it harder to read and understand. It's recommended to use four spaces for each level of indentation, as per PEP 8.
2. Missing docstrings: Some functions and classes lack docstrings, which can make it difficult for others to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions and classes.
3. Use of `utils.mask_token()`: The `utils.mask_token()` function is used to mask the token value, but it's not clear what this function does or why it's necessary. It's recommended to include a comment explaining the purpose of this function.
4. Use of `CONF.console.allowed_origins`: The `CONF.console.allowed_origins` variable is used to store a list of allowed origins, but it's not clear where this variable is defined or how it's populated. It's recommended to include a comment explaining the purpose of this variable and where it's defined.
5. Use of `urlparse.urlparse()`: The `urlparse.urlparse()` function is used to parse URLs, but it's not clear why it's necessary in some places. For example, in the `NovaProxyRequestHandlerBase.address_string()` method, the `urlparse.urlparse()` function is used to parse the access URL, but it's not clear why this is necessary when the URL is already available as a string.
6. Use of `socket.MSG_PEEK`: The `socket.MSG_PEEK` constant is used to peek at the data in a socket, but it's not clear why it's necessary in some places. For example, in the `NovaProxyRequestHandlerBase.do_proxy()` method, the `socket.MSG_PEEK` constant is used to peek at the data in the target socket, but it's not clear why this is necessary when the data is already being read from the socket.
7. Use of `except Exception`: The `except Exception` block is used to catch all exceptions, but it's not clear why this is necessary in some places. It's recommended to catch only the specific exceptions that are expected and handle them appropriately.
8. Use of `self.vmsg()`: The `self.vmsg()` method is used to log messages, but it's not clear what the purpose of this method is or why it's necessary. It's recommended to include a comment explaining the purpose of this method.
9. Use of `websockify.WebSocketServer.socket()`: The `websockify.WebSocketServer.socket()` method is used to create a WebSocket server, but it's not clear why it's necessary to create a server when the code is supposed to be a client. It's recommended to clarify the purpose of this method and why it's necessary.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and follows good security practices. However, the points mentioned above can be improved to make the code more readable and maintainable.
