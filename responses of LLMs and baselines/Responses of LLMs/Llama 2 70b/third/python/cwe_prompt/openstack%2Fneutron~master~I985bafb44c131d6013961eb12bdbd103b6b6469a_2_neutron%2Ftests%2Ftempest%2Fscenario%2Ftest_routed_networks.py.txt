 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I did notice some coding conventions that could be improved.

1. Consistent indentation: In Python, it's conventional to use four spaces for each level of indentation. However, in this code, both four and eight spaces are used inconsistently throughout the code. It's better to pick one convention and stick to it.
2. Line length: Some lines are very long, such as line 181, which makes the code harder to read. It's better to break long lines into shorter ones for better readability.
3. Naming conventions: Some variable names, such as "phy_network" and "network_type," are not following the usual naming conventions. It's better to use descriptive and meaningful variable names that follow the conventions.
4. Comments: Some functions have no comments describing what they do or why they are needed. Adding comments can make the code easier to understand and maintain.
5. Function signature: Some functions have no return type specified, such as the "_create_routed_network" function. It's better to specify the return type to make the code more readable and maintainable.
6. Consistent exception handling: The code has different ways of handling exceptions, such as "assertEqual" in the "_ssh_check" function and "subprocess.call" in the same function. It's better to handle exceptions consistently throughout the code.
