 I have reviewed the provided code and did not detect any security defects. The code seems to be a configuration file for an extension, and it does not contain any suspicious or potentially dangerous code.

The code uses a few constants and variables to define the extension's properties, such as its name, description, and version. It also defines some empty maps and lists that are likely used to store additional data or configuration options.

The code does not contain any user input or sensitive data, and it does not perform any network communication or file access operations that could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, based on the provided code, I conclude that there are no security defects detected.
