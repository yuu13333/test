 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters and return types. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand, and also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The code can benefit from adding docstrings for functions and classes. Docstrings provide a brief description of the function or class, which can help others understand the purpose and usage of the code.
4. Function signature:
The `docker_build` function takes a list of servers as input, but it's not clear what the function does with the list. It would be better to define a clear signature for the function, including the input and output types, and document what the function does.
5. Error handling:
The code uses `exit(-1)` to terminate the program when an error occurs. It's better to use a more robust error handling mechanism, such as raising an exception and catching it appropriately. This will make the code more resilient and easier to debug.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to manage and maintain. It's better to break the code into smaller modules or classes, each with a single responsibility, to make the code more modular and easier to understand.
7. Environment variables:
The code uses environment variables to store sensitive information, such as passwords. It's better to use environment variables only for non-sensitive information, and store sensitive information in a secure way, such as encrypted files or secure databases.
8. Command injection:
The code uses `check_call` and `Popen` to execute shell commands. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized. It's better to use a secure mechanism, such as `subprocess.check_call` with argument passing, to execute shell commands.
9. Information disclosure:
The code logs sensitive information, such as server names and IP addresses, at the debug level. It's better to log only non-sensitive information at the debug level and use a more secure mechanism, such as encryption or pseudonymization, to protect sensitive information.

I hope these suggestions help improve the security and quality of the code.
