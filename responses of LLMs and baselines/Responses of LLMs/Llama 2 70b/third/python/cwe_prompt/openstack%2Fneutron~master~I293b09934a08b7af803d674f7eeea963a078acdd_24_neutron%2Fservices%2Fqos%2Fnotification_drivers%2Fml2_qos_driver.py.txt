 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses the `neutron.services.qos.notification_drivers.message_queue` module, which is not included in the code snippet provided. This module is responsible for handling the message queue for QoS notifications. It would be beneficial to include this module in the code snippet to ensure that the code is complete and functional.

Additionally, I noticed that the code uses the `ruletype` attribute in the `rule` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided. It would be helpful to define this attribute or provide a reference to where it is defined.

Lastly, the code uses the `qos_consts` module, which is not included in the code snippet provided. This module defines constants related to QoS. It would be beneficial to include this module in the code snippet to ensure that the code is complete and functional.
