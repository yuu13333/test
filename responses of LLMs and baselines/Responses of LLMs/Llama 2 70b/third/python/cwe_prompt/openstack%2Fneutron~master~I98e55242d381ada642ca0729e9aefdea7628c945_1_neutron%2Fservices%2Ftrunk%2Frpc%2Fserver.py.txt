 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use separate words with underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. Some functions and variables have type hints, while others don't. It's better to add type hints and annotations for all functions and variables to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions and classes. Docstrings help provide context and information about the purpose and behavior of the code. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions and classes.
4. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have redundant or inconsistent parameter lists. For example, the `trunk_by_port_provider` function takes a `resource` parameter, but it's not used anywhere in the function. It's better to remove unnecessary parameters and ensure that function signatures are consistent throughout the code.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple classes and modules, but it's not always clear how they relate to each other. It's a good practice to use a consistent naming convention for modules and classes and to organize the code in a way that makes it easy to understand and maintain.
6. Comments and documentation:
The code has some comments, but they are not always clear or up-to-date. It's a good practice to add clear and concise comments to explain the purpose and behavior of the code, especially for complex functions or classes. Additionally, it's a good idea to include documentation strings for classes and modules to provide a high-level overview of their purpose and behavior.
