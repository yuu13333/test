 I have reviewed the provided code, and I have identified a few potential security defects. Here are my findings:

1. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):
In line 64, the `FIP_OBJ` attribute is assigned a value without proper authorization checks. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the `FIP_OBJ` attribute and potentially access unauthorized data. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to add an authorization check before assigning a value to the `FIP_OBJ` attribute.
2. Insecure deserialization:
In line 90, the `from_db_object()` method is vulnerable to insecure deserialization. The method takes a `db_obj` parameter and assigns its attributes to the current object without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities and execute arbitrary code. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to validate and sanitize the `db_obj` parameter before assigning its attributes to the current object.
3. Information Disclosure:
In line 105, the `modify_fields_from_db()` method modifies the `fields` dictionary by adding the `internal_ip_address` and `internal_port` fields. However, these fields are not sanitized or validated, which could lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to sanitize and validate the `fields` dictionary before modifying it.
4. SQL Injection:
In line 119, the `get_port_forwarding_obj_by_routers()` method uses raw SQL queries, which are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to use parameterized queries or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework to prevent SQL injection attacks.
5. Insecure Iterator:
In line 128, the `_unique_port_forwarding_iterator()` method uses an insecure iterator that could lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to use a secure iterator that properly validates and sanitizes the input data.

To address these security defects, it's recommended to implement the following fixes:

1. Add an authorization check before assigning a value to the `FIP_OBJ` attribute in line 64.
2. Validate and sanitize the `db_obj` parameter in the `from_db_object()` method before assigning its attributes to the current object.
3. Sanitize and validate the `fields` dictionary in the `modify_fields_from_db()` method before modifying it.
4. Use parameterized queries or an ORM framework to prevent SQL injection attacks in the `get_port_forwarding_obj_by_routers()` method.
5. Use a secure iterator that properly validates and sanitizes the input data in the `_unique_port_forwarding_iterator()` method.

By implementing these fixes, you can mitigate the identified security defects and improve the overall security posture of your code.
