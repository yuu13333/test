 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and variables should have type hints and annotations to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
The code should include docstrings for functions, classes, and modules to provide a brief description of their purpose and usage.
4. Error handling:
The code should handle errors more robustly, for example, by catching specific exceptions and providing informative error messages.
5. Code organization:
The code should be organized in a more modular way, with separate modules or classes for different functionalities. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
6. Testing:
The code should include more test cases to cover various scenarios and edge cases. Additionally, the test cases should be organized in a separate module or class to keep the code organized.
7. Security:
The code should consider security aspects, such as input validation and authentication, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
