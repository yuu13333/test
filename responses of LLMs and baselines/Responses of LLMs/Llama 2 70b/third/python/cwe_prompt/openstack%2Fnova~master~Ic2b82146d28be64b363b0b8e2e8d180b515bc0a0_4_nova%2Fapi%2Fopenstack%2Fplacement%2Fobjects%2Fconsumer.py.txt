 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
In some places, the code uses camelCase naming conventions (e.g., "consumerUuid"), while in other places, it uses underscores (e.g., "consumer_id"). It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's better to add type hints and annotations for all function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions, even if they are short.
4. Function signature:
Some functions have a large number of parameters, which can make the code hard to read. Consider breaking down these functions into smaller functions with fewer parameters.
5. Consistent indentation:
The code uses inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read.
6. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose and usage of functions, classes, and variables will make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
7. Class naming convention:
The class naming convention is inconsistent. Some classes use camelCase (e.g., "Consumer"), while others use underscores (e.g., "Project"). It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code.
8. Method naming convention:
Some method names are inconsistent. For example, "create" is not consistent with other method names that use underscores. It's better to use underscores consistently throughout the code.
9. Variable naming convention:
Some variable names are inconsistent. For example, "uuid" is not consistent with other variable names that use underscores. It's better to use underscores consistently throughout the code.
10. Code organization:
The code is organized into many small files, which can make it difficult to understand the overall structure of the code. Consider organizing the code into larger files or modules to make it easier to understand and maintain.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to read, but there are some areas where it can be improved for better readability and maintainability.
