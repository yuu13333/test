 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code indentation is not consistent, and some lines are too long, making them difficult to read. It is recommended to follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code, which provides guidelines for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.

Additionally, some of the test methods are quite long and complex, which can make them difficult to understand and maintain. It's a good practice to break down long methods into smaller ones, each with a single responsibility, to improve code readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and the tests cover various scenarios. However, it's essential to follow best practices for code style and organization to ensure that the code is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
