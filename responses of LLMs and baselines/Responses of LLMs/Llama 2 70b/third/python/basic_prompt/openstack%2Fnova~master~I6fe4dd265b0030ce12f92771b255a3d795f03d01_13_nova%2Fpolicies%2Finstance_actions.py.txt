 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the functions and variables lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's recommended to add docstrings for all public functions and variables.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports `policy.DeprecatedRule` and `policy.DocumentedRuleDefault`, but they are not used anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and avoid confusion.
4. Trailing commas:
Some of the lists and dictionaries have trailing commas, which is not necessary and can be removed.
5. Indentation:
The indentation is inconsistent in some places, such as line 41 and 45. It's better to keep the indentation consistent throughout the code.
6. Unnecessary blank lines:
There are some unnecessary blank lines, such as lines 99 and 100. It's better to remove them to keep the code clean and concise.
7. Missing `oslo_policy` import:
The code uses `oslo_policy` module, but it's not imported. It's better to import it to avoid any potential issues.

Here's an updated version of the code with these minor issues fixed:

Note that this code is still using the `oslo_policy` module, which is deprecated in favor of the `policy` module. It's recommended to update the code to use the `policy` module instead.
