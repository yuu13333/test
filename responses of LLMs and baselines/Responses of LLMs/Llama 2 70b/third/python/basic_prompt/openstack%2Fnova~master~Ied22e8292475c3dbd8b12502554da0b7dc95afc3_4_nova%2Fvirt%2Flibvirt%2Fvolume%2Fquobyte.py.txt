 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for most functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can improve code readability and help others understand the code better.
4. Error handling:
The code catches generic exceptions like `OSError` and `ProcessExecutionError`, but it's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately. For example, instead of catching `OSError` and logging an error message, it's better to catch `ENOTCONN` and handle it appropriately.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into separate functions, but some functions are quite long and complex. It's better to break down long functions into smaller functions to improve code readability and maintainability.
6. Variable naming:
Some variable names are quite long and complex, making them difficult to read and understand. It's better to use shorter and more descriptive variable names.
7. Unused imports:
The code imports some modules that are not used, such as `six`. It's better to remove unused imports to reduce code clutter.
8. Unused variables:
The code defines some variables that are not used, such as `max_checks`. It's better to remove unused variables to reduce code clutter.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and I didn't find any security defects. However, following best practices for code organization, naming, and error handling can improve the code's readability and maintainability.
