 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that may not be directly related to security but can still impact the overall quality of the code:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
In some places, the naming convention for variables and functions deviates from the standard "snake_case" convention used throughout the code. For example, "zone_id" and "remain_entries" use camelCase convention, while "delete_entries" and "icmp_entry" use snake_case. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. Some functions and variables have type hints, while others don't. It's a good practice to use type hints and annotations consistently throughout the code to make it easier to understand and maintain.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for some functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can help other developers understand the code better and reduce the likelihood of errors.
4. Code organization:
The code is organized into separate functions for different test cases, which is good. However, it may be beneficial to break down the longer functions into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability. For example, the "test_delete_icmp_entry" function is quite long and complex, and it may be better to split it into smaller functions each with a single responsibility.
5. Error handling:
The code uses "try-except" blocks to handle errors, but it doesn't always handle errors consistently. For example, in the "test_delete_icmp_entry" function, there are places where the code raises a generic "Exception" instead of a more specific exception type. It's better to use specific exception types to handle errors appropriately and provide more informative error messages.
6. Unused code:
The code has some unused imports and variables that can be removed. For example, the "nl_lib" module is imported but not used, and the "MAX_CONNTRACK_ZONE_ID" variable is defined but not used. Removing unused code can make the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.

Overall, while there are no direct security defects in the code, addressing these minor issues can improve the code's quality, readability, and maintainability.
