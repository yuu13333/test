 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent indentation: The indentation in the code is inconsistent, with some lines having 4 spaces and others having 8 spaces. It's best to stick to a consistent indentation of 4 spaces to make the code easier to read.
2. Unused imports: The code imports the `cfg` module, but it's not used anywhere. It's best to remove the unused import to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
3. Missing docstrings: Some of the configuration options have missing docstrings. It's important to include docstrings for each configuration option to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage.
4. Deprecated options: The code includes deprecated options such as `api_insecure`, `cafile`, `certfile`, and `keyfile`. It's best to remove these deprecated options and replace them with the recommended alternatives to avoid confusion and improve security.
5. Insecure default values: The `api_insecure` option is set to `False` by default, which means that SSL verification is disabled by default. It's recommended to change the default value to `True` to ensure that SSL verification is enabled by default, improving security.
6. Missing `help` parameter: Some of the configuration options are missing the `help` parameter. It's important to include the `help` parameter for each configuration option to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and usage.
7. Unnecessary configuration options: The `glance_group` configuration option is not used anywhere in the code. It's best to remove this configuration option to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
8. Unused variable: The `deprecated` variable is defined but not used anywhere in the code. It's best to remove this variable to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and easy to understand, with minimal security defects. However, addressing the minor issues and suggestions for improvement listed above can help improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security.
