 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent indentation and spacing: Throughout the code, there are inconsistencies in indentation and spacing, which can make the code harder to read and understand. It's recommended to use a consistent number of spaces for indentation and to align similar code elements in a consistent manner.
2. Type hints for function parameters: Type hints are not provided for all function parameters, which can make the code harder to understand and may lead to type-related issues. It's recommended to add type hints for all function parameters.
3. Type hints for variable assignments: In some places, variables are assigned without providing type hints. It's recommended to provide type hints for variable assignments to make the code more readable and to avoid potential type-related issues.
4. Consistent naming conventions: The naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes are not consistent throughout the code. It's recommended to follow consistent naming conventions to make the code easier to read and understand.
5. Docstrings: Docstrings are missing for some functions and classes, which can make the code harder to understand and use. It's recommended to add docstrings for all functions and classes to provide information about their purpose and usage.
6. Function signature: The function signature for the `_validate_port_rules_supported` function is not consistent with the other functions. It's recommended to update the function signature to be consistent with the other functions.
7. Unused imports: The `portbindings` module is imported but not used in the code. It's recommended to remove unused imports to avoid clutter and potential issues.
8. Unused variables: Some variables are defined but not used in the code. It's recommended to remove unused variables to avoid clutter and potential issues.
9. Complexity: The code has a high cyclomatic complexity, which can make it harder to understand and maintain. It's recommended to break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions to reduce complexity and improve readability.
10. Testing: The code does not include any tests, which can make it harder to ensure that it works correctly. It's recommended to add tests to the code to ensure its correctness and to catch potential issues.
