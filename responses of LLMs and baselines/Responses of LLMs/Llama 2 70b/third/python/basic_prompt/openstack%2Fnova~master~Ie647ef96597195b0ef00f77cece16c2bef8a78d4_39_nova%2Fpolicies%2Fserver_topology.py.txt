 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The code has docstrings for the functions and classes, but they are not consistently formatted. It's better to follow a consistent format for docstrings, such as using triple quotes and including a brief description, parameters, return type, and any other relevant information.
3. Line breaks and indentation:
The code has inconsistent line breaks and indentation. It's better to use consistent line breaks and indentation to make the code more readable.
4. Comments:
The code has comments that are not necessary and do not add any value. It's better to remove unnecessary comments and keep the code clean and concise.
5. Code organization:
The code has a mix of policies and functions in the same file. It's better to separate the policies and functions into different files to make the code more organized and easier to maintain.
6. Function signature:
The `list_rules()` function does not have a clear signature. It's better to include a clear signature that describes the function's purpose, parameters, return type, and any other relevant information.
7. Type hints:
The code does not use type hints for the function parameters and return types. It's better to include type hints to make the code more readable and easier to understand.

Overall, the code looks clean and well-structured, but there are a few minor issues that could be improved to make it more consistent and readable.
