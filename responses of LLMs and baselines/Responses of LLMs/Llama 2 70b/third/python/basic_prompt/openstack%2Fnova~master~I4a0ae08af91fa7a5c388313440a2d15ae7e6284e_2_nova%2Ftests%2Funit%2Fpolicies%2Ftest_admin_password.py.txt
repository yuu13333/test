 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
In line 14, the import statement for `uuids` is using camelCase convention, while the rest of the code is using snake_case convention. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The docstrings for the classes and methods are missing. It's a good practice to include docstrings to provide a brief description of the class or method, and to help others understand the purpose and usage of the code.
3. Type hints:
The function parameters and return types are not annotated with type hints. Adding type hints can help catch type-related errors and make the code more readable.
4. Mocking:
The `mock_get` fixture is used to mock the `get_instance` function, but it's not clear what the mocked function returns. It's better to specify the return value of the mocked function to avoid unexpected behavior.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple classes, but the classes are not clearly separated. It's better to separate the classes into different files or modules to make the code more manageable and easier to understand.
6. Testing:
The tests are not well-organized, and it's not clear what the tests are testing. It's better to write clear and descriptive test names and to organize the tests into separate test cases.
7. Configuration:
The `enforce_scope` flag is set to `True` in the `setUp` method of the `AdminPasswordScopeTypePolicyTest` class. It's not clear why this flag is set, and it's not documented. It's better to add a comment to explain the purpose of this flag and why it's set to `True`.
