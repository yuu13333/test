 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations: The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's better to use them consistently throughout the code to make it easier to understand and maintain.
3. Docstrings: The code lacks docstrings for some functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions, even if they are short.
4. Error handling: The code catches and ignores some exceptions without proper error handling. For example, in the `error_application` function, the `exc` variable is not used, and the function returns a stub application that always returns an error message. It's better to handle errors more robustly and provide more informative error messages.
5. Code organization: The code is organized into several functions, but some of them are quite long and complex. It's better to break down long functions into smaller, more focused functions to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Environment variable handling: The code uses environment variables without proper validation. It's a good practice to validate environment variables to ensure they are in the correct format and meet certain criteria.
7. Logging: The code uses logging, but the log messages are not very informative. It's better to include more context and information in log messages to make them more useful for debugging and troubleshooting.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and I didn't find any glaring security defects. However, following best practices and improving code quality can make the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
