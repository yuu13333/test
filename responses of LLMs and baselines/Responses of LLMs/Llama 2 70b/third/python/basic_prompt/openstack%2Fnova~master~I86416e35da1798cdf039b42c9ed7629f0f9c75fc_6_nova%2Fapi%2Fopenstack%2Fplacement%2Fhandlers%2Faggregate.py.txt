 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
Some functions and variables lack docstrings, which can make it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can improve the code's readability and help developers understand how to use the code effectively.
4. Error handling:
The code handles errors by raising HTTP exceptions, but it doesn't provide detailed error messages or error codes. Implementing a more robust error handling mechanism can help identify and resolve issues more effectively.
5. Security-related improvements:
Although the code doesn't contain any security defects, there are a few security-related improvements that can be made:
* Input validation: The code doesn't validate user input properly. Implementing input validation can help prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* Authentication and authorization: The code doesn't include any authentication or authorization mechanisms. Implementing authentication and authorization can help ensure that only authorized users can access the resource provider and its associated aggregates.
* Data encryption: The code doesn't encrypt data properly. Implementing data encryption can help protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to understand. However, implementing the suggested improvements can make the code more robust, secure, and maintainable.
