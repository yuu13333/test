 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
Some function parameters and variables lack type hints and annotations. Adding type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. Adding docstrings can improve code readability and help others understand the code better.
4. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple classes and functions, but some functions are quite long and complex. It may be beneficial to break down longer functions into smaller functions to improve code readability and maintainability.
5. Comments:
Some parts of the code have comments that are not very descriptive or are redundant. It's better to have clear and concise comments that explain the purpose and logic of the code.
6. Code style:
Some code style issues, such as inconsistent indentation and spacing, can make the code harder to read. Following a consistent code style guide can improve code readability and maintainability.
7. Testing:
The code seems to be missing unit tests or integration tests. Adding tests can help catch bugs and ensure that the code functions correctly in different scenarios.
8. Configuration handling:
The code uses a configuration file to store settings, but it's not clear how the configuration file is generated or managed. It's better to have a clear configuration management process to ensure that the configuration file is accurate and up-to-date.
9. Logging:
The code uses logging, but some log messages are not very descriptive. It's better to have clear and concise log messages that provide useful information about the state of the system.
10. Error handling:
The code seems to lack error handling for some scenarios. Adding error handling can help catch unexpected errors and improve the overall reliability of the system.

Overall, while there are no major security defects in the code, following best practices for coding, such as those mentioned above, can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and reliability.
