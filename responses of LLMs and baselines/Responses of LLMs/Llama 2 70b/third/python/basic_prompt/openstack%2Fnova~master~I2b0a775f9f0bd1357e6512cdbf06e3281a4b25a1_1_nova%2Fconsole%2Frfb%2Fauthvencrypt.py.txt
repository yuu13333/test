 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. Adding docstrings can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused variables:
The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `sub_types_raw` and `auth_accepted`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Complicated logic:
The code has a complex logic for handling the VeNCrypt security handshake. It may be helpful to break down the logic into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Missing error handling:
The code does not handle all possible error cases, such as an invalid response from the server or a failure to establish a TLS connection. Adding error handling mechanisms can make the code more robust and reliable.
6. Hardcoded values:
The code has hardcoded values for the VeNCrypt version and sub-auth types. It may be better to define these values as constants or configuration options to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
7. Unnecessary imports:
The code imports some modules that are not used anywhere, such as `six`. It's better to remove unnecessary imports to reduce code clutter.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and secure. However, following best practices and addressing the suggestions above can improve its quality and maintainability.
