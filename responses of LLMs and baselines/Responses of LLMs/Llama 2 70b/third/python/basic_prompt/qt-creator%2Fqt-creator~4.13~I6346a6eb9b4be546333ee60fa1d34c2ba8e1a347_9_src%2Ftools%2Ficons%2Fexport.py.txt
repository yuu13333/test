 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent indentation: The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines have 4 spaces, while others have 8 or 12. It's best to pick a consistent indentation size (e.g., 4 spaces) and stick to it throughout the code.
2. Line wrapping: Some lines are very long and could be wrapped for better readability. For example, the `actions` list in the `exportPngs` function could be wrapped after the `export-dpi` element.
3. Function naming: Some function names are not very descriptive. For example, `pngName` could be renamed to `get_png_name` or `png_filename` to make its purpose clearer.
4. Variable naming: Some variable names are not very descriptive. For example, `svgIDs` could be renamed to `svg_element_ids` or `ids` to make its purpose clearer.
5. Docstrings: The code does not include docstrings for any of the functions. Adding docstrings can help provide context and make the code easier to understand for others.
6. Error handling: The code does not include any error handling for the `subprocess.run` command in the `optimizePngs` function. If the `optipng` command fails, the code will raise an exception. It's best to include a try-except block to handle any potential errors.
7. Code organization: The code is organized into separate functions, which is good. However, it might be beneficial to group related functions together, such as putting the `exportPngs` and `optimizePngs` functions in a separate module or class.
8. Comments: The code includes some comments, but they are not very descriptive. Adding more detailed comments can help explain the purpose of each function and make the code easier to understand for others.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and I did not detect any security defects. However, following best practices for code organization, naming, and error handling can make the code more maintainable and easier to understand for others.
