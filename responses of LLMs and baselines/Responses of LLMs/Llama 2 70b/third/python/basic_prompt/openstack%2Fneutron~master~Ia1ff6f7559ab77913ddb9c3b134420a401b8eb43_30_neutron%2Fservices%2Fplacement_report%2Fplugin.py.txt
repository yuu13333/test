 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable and method names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable definitions. This will make the code easier to understand and help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
Adding docstrings to classes, methods, and functions will help provide context and explain the purpose of the code. This will make the code easier to understand for developers who may need to work with it in the future.
4. Code organization:
The code is organized into several classes and modules, but it's not immediately clear how they relate to each other. Consider breaking the code into smaller, more focused modules or classes, and use meaningful names to help clarify their purpose.
5. Comments and logging:
The code has minimal comments and logging statements. Adding more comments and logging statements can help explain the code's behavior and make it easier to debug.
6. Error handling:
The code has several places where it swallows exceptions without properly logging or handling them. Consider adding better error handling and logging mechanisms to help identify and resolve issues.
7. Code style:
The code has inconsistent indentation and spacing. Consider using a consistent coding style and formatting the code to make it easier to read.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and there are no obvious security defects. However, following the suggestions above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality.
