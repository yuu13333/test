 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that may not be directly related to security but can improve the overall quality of the code:

1. Consistent coding style:
The code uses both snake_case and camelCase naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Type hints and annotations:
Some functions and variables lack type hints and annotations, making it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. Adding type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch potential type-related errors.
3. Docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings, which can make it challenging to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can improve code readability and provide a reference for developers who need to use these functions and classes.
4. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have inconsistent signature formats. For example, `wrap_list` has a single line signature, while `unicode2hex` has a multi-line signature. It's better to use a consistent signature format throughout the code.
5. Function name consistency:
Some function names are not consistent with the naming conventions used in the rest of the code. For example, `wrap_list` does not follow the camelCase convention used in other functions. It's better to use consistent naming conventions throughout the code.
6. Unused imports:
The code imports `pathlib` and `tempfile`, but they are not used anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
7. Redundant `except` block:
The `AtomicRenameTemporaryFile` context manager has a redundant `except` block that catches all exceptions and re-raises them. It's better to remove this block and let the exceptions propagate up the call stack, as it can make the code harder to debug.
8. Missing `os` import:
The code uses the `os.path.join` function, but the `os` module is not imported. It's better to import the `os` module to avoid a potential runtime error.

Overall, the code seems well-structured, and the issues mentioned above are minor and do not directly impact security. However, addressing these issues can improve the code's readability and maintainability.
