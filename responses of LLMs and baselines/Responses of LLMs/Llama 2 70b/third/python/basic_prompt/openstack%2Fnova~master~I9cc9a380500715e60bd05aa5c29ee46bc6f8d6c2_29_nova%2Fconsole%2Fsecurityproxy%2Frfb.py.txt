 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings: Some functions and variables lack docstrings that describe their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused imports: The code imports the `six` module, but it doesn't seem to be used anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid cluttering the code.
4. Unnecessary comments: Some comments are not necessary and can be removed. For example, the comment `'''`Only the security type None (%d) is supported'''` is not needed, as the code already makes it clear that only the `auth.AuthType.NONE` type is supported.
5. Redundant exception handling: The code catches `exception.RFBAuthHandshakeFailed` and `exception.SecurityProxyNegotiationFailed` exceptions, but it doesn't handle them differently. Instead, it could raise a custom exception with a more informative message.
6. Use of `six.text_type()`: The code uses `six.text_type()` to convert exception messages to strings. However, it's better to use the `str()` function instead, as it's more Pythonic and easier to read.
7. Use of `six.byte2int()` and `six.int2byte()`: The code uses `six.byte2int()` and `six.int2byte()` to convert between bytes and integers. However, it's better to use the built-in `int.from_bytes()` and `bytes.from_int()` functions instead, as they are more Pythonic and easier to read.
8. Missing type hints: Some functions and variables lack type hints, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Adding type hints can help improve code readability and reduce potential type errors.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, and there are no major security defects or issues that could lead to security vulnerabilities. However, addressing the minor issues mentioned above can improve the code's readability and maintainability.
