 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential improvements that could be made to the code:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and variables could benefit from type hints and annotations. This would make the code more readable and easier to understand, and also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The function docstrings are missing or incomplete. Adding clear and concise docstrings for each function and method would help understand the purpose and parameters of the function, and also provide context for other developers who may need to work with the code in the future.
4. Error handling:
The code catches and re-raises exceptions without properly logging or handling them. It's a good practice to catch and log exceptions properly, and also provide clear error messages and HTTP status codes to the client.
5. Code organization:
The code is quite long and complex, and it might benefit from being broken down into smaller functions or methods, each with a single responsibility. This would make the code easier to read and maintain.
6. Comments:
The code has some comments, but they are not very descriptive or clear. Adding more detailed comments and explanations for each section of the code would help understand the logic and intent of the code.
7. Testing:
The code does not include any tests or assertions. Adding tests would help ensure that the code functions correctly and catch any bugs or edge cases.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, with a few improvements, it could be even better and more maintainable.
