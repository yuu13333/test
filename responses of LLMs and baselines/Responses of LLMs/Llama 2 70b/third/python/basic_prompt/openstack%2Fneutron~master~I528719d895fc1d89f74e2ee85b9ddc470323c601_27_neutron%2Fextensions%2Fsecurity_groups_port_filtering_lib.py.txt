 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks documentation for some variables and functions. It's recommended to add docstrings to improve readability and understandability.
3. Unused variables:
The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `UPDATED_TIMESTAMP` and `REQUIRED_EXTENSIONS`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Hardcoded values:
The code hardcodes some values, such as the license URL and the extension alias. It's better to define these values as constants or environment variables to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
5. Missing error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly. It's recommended to add error handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks, to handle unexpected errors and provide better error messages.
6. Unnecessary complexity:
The code has a complex structure with multiple nested dictionaries and lists. It's better to simplify the code by reducing the number of nested data structures and using more straightforward variable names.

Overall, the code is well-structured, and there are no significant security defects. However, following best practices and addressing the minor issues mentioned above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security.
