 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent coding style:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable and method names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses Python 2.7, which doesn't have built-in type hints and annotations. However, it's a good practice to add type hints and annotations for methods and variables, especially for methods that are expected to return certain types or take certain types of arguments.
3. Docstrings:
The code has limited docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and usage of certain methods and classes. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all methods and classes, including a brief description of what the method or class does, what input it takes, what output it returns, and any other relevant information.
4. Function naming:
Some of the function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are short and not very descriptive. It's a good practice to use descriptive names for all functions, so that it's clear what the function does without having to read its implementation.
5. Variable naming:
Some of the variable names are descriptive, while others are not. It's a good practice to use descriptive names for all variables, so that it's clear what the variable represents without having to read its implementation.
6. Consistent indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's a good practice to use consistent indentation throughout the code, so that it's easier to read and understand.
7. Comments:
The code has limited comments, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and usage of certain methods and classes. It's a good practice to add comments for all methods and classes, including a brief description of what the method or class does, what input it takes, what output it returns, and any other relevant information.
8. Testing:
The code has limited testing, which makes it difficult to ensure that the code works as expected. It's a good practice to add more tests for different scenarios, so that it's clear that the code works correctly in all cases.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand, but there are some areas where it can be improved for better readability, maintainability, and security.
