 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The code doesn't have docstrings for most of the functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions, even if they are trivial.
3. Type hints:
The code doesn't use type hints for function parameters and return types. Adding type hints can make the code more readable and easier to understand, and can also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
4. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors well. For example, if the API call to delete the server fails, the code will raise an HTTPException, which may not provide enough information to diagnose the problem. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, such as logging the error and providing a meaningful error message to the user.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to manage and maintain. It's a good practice to break the code into smaller files, each with its own specific functionality, to make it easier to understand and modify.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and the tests cover various scenarios. However, it's essential to follow best practices and conventions to make the code more maintainable and easier to understand for other developers.
