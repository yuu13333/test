 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of each function, variable, and block of code will make it easier to understand and maintain.
3. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are short and unclear. Try to use descriptive and meaningful names for all functions to avoid confusion.
4. Variable naming:
Some variable names are descriptive, while others are not. Use descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand. For example, instead of "server_list," consider using "servers_to_test" or "server_names_to_test."
5. Indentation:
The indentation is inconsistent in some places. Make sure to use four spaces for each level of indentation to maintain consistency.
6. Error handling:
The code has very limited error handling. Consider adding proper error handling to handle unexpected errors and exceptions gracefully.
7. Security:
Although there are no security defects in the code, it's essential to keep in mind security best practices when writing code. For example, consider using Docker's built-in security features, such as user namespaces, to enhance security.
8. Code organization:
The code is organized into different functions, but it's not immediately clear how they fit together. Consider organizing the code into modules or classes to make it easier to understand and maintain.
9. Testing:
The code seems to be focused on testing Docker configurations. Consider adding tests for other scenarios, such as network configurations, volume mounts, and environment variables.
10. Documentation:
The code has no documentation. Consider adding documentation to explain how to use the code, what each function does, and any dependencies or requirements.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there is room for improvement in terms of consistency, comments, function and variable naming, error handling, security, code organization, testing, and documentation.
