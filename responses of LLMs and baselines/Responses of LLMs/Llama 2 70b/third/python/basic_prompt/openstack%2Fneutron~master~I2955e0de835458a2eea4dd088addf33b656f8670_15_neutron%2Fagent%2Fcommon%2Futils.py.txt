 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and any other relevant information. Adding docstrings would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Type hints:
Some function parameters and return types are not annotated with type hints. Adding type hints would make the code more readable and easier to understand, and would also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
4. Exception handling:
The `load_interface_driver` function raises a `SystemExit` exception with a status code of 1 if the driver cannot be loaded. However, it would be better to catch the `ImportError` exception and handle it more gracefully, instead of letting it propagate and exiting the program.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into separate sections, but some functions and classes are not clearly separated. It would be better to break the code into smaller, more focused functions and classes, and to use meaningful variable names that describe their purpose.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and secure. However, following best practices and addressing the minor issues mentioned above would make the code more maintainable, readable, and efficient.
