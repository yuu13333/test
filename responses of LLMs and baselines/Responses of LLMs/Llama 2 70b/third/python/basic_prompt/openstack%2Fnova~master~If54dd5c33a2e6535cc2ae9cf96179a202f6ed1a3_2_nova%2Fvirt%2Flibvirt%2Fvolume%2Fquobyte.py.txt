 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few potential issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Missing docstrings: Some functions and variables lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can improve the code's readability and help other developers understand how to use the code.
3. Unused imports: The code imports some modules that are not used, such as 'oslo_concurrency' and 'oslo_log'. It's better to remove unused imports to reduce clutter and minimize potential issues.
4. Unnecessary complexity: Some parts of the code, such as the 'is_systemd' function, seem overly complex. Simplifying the code and reducing the number of special cases can make it easier to understand and maintain.
5. Missing error handling: The code does not handle some error cases, such as when the 'umount' command fails. Adding error handling can improve the code's robustness and prevent unexpected behavior.
6. Hardcoded paths: The code uses hardcoded paths for the 'systemctl' command and the Quobyte mount point. It's better to use configurable variables for these paths to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
7. Missing tests: The code does not include any tests, which makes it difficult to ensure that it functions correctly. Adding tests can improve the code's reliability and help identify issues earlier in the development process.

Overall, while there are no significant security defects in the code, there are some areas where the code could be improved for better readability, maintainability, and robustness.
