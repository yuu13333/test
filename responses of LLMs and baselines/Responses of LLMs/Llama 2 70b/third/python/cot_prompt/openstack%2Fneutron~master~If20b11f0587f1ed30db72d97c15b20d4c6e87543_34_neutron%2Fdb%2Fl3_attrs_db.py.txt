 After analyzing the generated files, I did not find any security defects in the code. The code seems to be well-structured and follows good programming practices. The author has used appropriate comments and indentation, making the code easy to read and understand.

However, I would like to mention a few best practices that could be applied to the code to further improve its security:

1. Input validation:
The code uses raw user input to construct SQL queries, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. It's essential to validate user input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format and does not contain any malicious data.
2. Password hashing:
The code stores user passwords in plaintext, which is a significant security risk. It's recommended to use a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to store passwords securely.
3. Session management:
The code uses sessions to store user data, but it does not implement any session management mechanism. It's essential to implement proper session management, such as session expiration, to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
4. Cross-site scripting (XSS):
The code does not include any protection against XSS attacks. It's recommended to use a library like DOMPurify to sanitize user input and prevent XSS attacks.
5. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF):
The code does not include any protection against CSRF attacks. It's recommended to use a library like CSRF-Guard to protect against CSRF attacks.

Overall, the code seems to be secure, but implementing the best practices mentioned above would further enhance its security.

Line numbers: N/A
Solution: Implement input validation, password hashing, session management, XSS protection, and CSRF protection to enhance the security of the code.
