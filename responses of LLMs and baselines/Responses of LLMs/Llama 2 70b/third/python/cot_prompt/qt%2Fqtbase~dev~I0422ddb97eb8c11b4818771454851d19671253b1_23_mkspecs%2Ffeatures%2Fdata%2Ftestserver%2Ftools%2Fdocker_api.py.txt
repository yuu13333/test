 After analyzing the generated files, I did not find any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code is not using any secure practices for Docker image building and deployment. The code is using the `docker run` command with the `-d` flag, which runs the container in detached mode, and the `-h` flag, which sets the container's hostname. While this is not necessarily a security issue, it is not a recommended practice for Docker image deployment.

Instead, it is recommended to use the `docker-compose` tool for managing Docker containers. `docker-compose` provides a more secure and reliable way of deploying Docker containers, as it allows for better control over the container's environment and configuration.

Additionally, the code is not using any authentication or authorization mechanisms for accessing the Docker API. This means that any user with access to the Docker API can potentially manipulate or compromise the containers. It is recommended to use authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as Docker tokens or AWS IAM roles, to secure access to the Docker API.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, there are some security
