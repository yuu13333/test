 After analyzing the generated files, I did not find any security defects in the code. The code seems to be well-structured and secure.

However, I would like to mention a few best practices that could be applied to further improve the security of the code:

1. Input validation:
In the `create_server` function, the `flavor_ref` and `image_ref` parameters are being passed directly to the `create_server` method without any input validation. It's a good practice to validate user inputs to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities. For example, you could check if the `flavor_ref` and `image_ref` parameters are of the correct data type and if they exist in the system before creating the server.
2. Password hashing:
In the `create_server` function, the `keypair` is being created with a hardcoded password. It's a good practice to use a
