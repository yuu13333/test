 After analyzing the generated files, I did not detect any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code uses the `mask_password` function to mask the token field in the request. While this function is intended to protect the token from being exposed, it is important to note that it does not provide complete security. An attacker could still potentially extract the token by exploiting a vulnerability in the application or by using a side-channel attack. Therefore, it is important to use additional security measures, such as encryption, to protect the token.

Additionally, the code uses the `socket` module to establish a websocket connection. It is important to note that the `socket` module can be vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the code is properly bounds-checking and validating user input to prevent such attacks.

In summary, while I did not detect any security defects in the code, it is important to keep in mind that security is an ongoing process and that additional security measures should be implemented to protect the application.

Line numbers: N/A
Solution: Implement additional security measures such as encryption and input validation to protect the token and prevent potential attacks.
