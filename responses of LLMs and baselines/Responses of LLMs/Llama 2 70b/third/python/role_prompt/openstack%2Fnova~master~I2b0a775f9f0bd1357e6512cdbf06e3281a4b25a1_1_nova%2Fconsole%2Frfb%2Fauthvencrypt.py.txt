 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not annotated. Adding type hints and annotations will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for the functions and classes. Adding docstrings will help provide context and information about the purpose of the functions and classes.
4. Error handling:
The code only handles errors partially. It's better to handle errors more comprehensively, for example, by using try-except blocks and logging the errors.
5. Consistent indentation:
The indentation is not consistent throughout the code. It's better to use consistent indentation to make the code more readable.
6. Security considerations:
The code uses SSL/TLS encryption, which is good. However, it's important to ensure that the certificate and key used are valid and trusted. Additionally, it's a good practice to use secure communication channels, such as HTTPS, for remote connections.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and the security protocol seems to be implemented correctly. With a few improvements, the code can be even better.
