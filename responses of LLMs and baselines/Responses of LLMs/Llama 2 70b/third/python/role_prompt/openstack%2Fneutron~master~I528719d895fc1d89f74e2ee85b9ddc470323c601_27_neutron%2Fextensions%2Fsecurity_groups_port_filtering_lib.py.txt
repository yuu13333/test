 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the variables and functions lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all public variables and functions.
3. Unused variables:
The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `UPDATED_TIMESTAMP` and `REQUIRED_EXTENSIONS`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Hardcoded values:
The code hardcodes some values, such as the alias and description of the extension, which could be configured dynamically instead. This would make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
5. Lack of comments:
Some parts of the code lack comments, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and usage of the code. It's a good practice to include comments for all code blocks, especially for complex logic or algorithms.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to read. However, following best practices and addressing the minor issues mentioned above can improve the code's maintainability, readability, and security.
