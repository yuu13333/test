 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
Some of the functions and variables lack docstrings. It's a good practice to include docstrings for functions, variables, and classes to provide information about their purpose and usage.
3. Type hints:
The code uses type hints for some variables and functions, but not for all. It's a good practice to include type hints for all variables and functions to make the code more readable and maintainable.
4. Constant naming:
The code defines some constants using camelCase convention, but it's better to use uppercase convention for constants, e.g., `ROOT_POLICY` instead of `root_policy`.
5. Deprecated rules:
The code includes deprecated rules, which is a good practice to maintain backward compatibility. However, it's recommended to remove the deprecated rules and replace them with the new rules in the next major release.
6. Consistency in indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it more readable.
7. Trailing commas:
Some of the lists and dictionaries have trailing commas, which is not necessary and can be removed.
8. Unused variables:
The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, e.g., `DEPRECATED_INSTANCE_ACTION_POLICY` and `DEPRECATED_REASON`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and improve code readability.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to understand. With the suggested improvements, it can become even more maintainable and readable.
