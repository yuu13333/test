 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses Type hints and annotations for some variables and functions, but not for all. It's a good practice to add type hints and annotations for all variables and functions to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. docstrings:
The code has docstrings for some functions, but not for all. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions to provide a clear understanding of what the function does and what its inputs and outputs are.
4. Function signature:
The `create_vms` function takes in `hyper`, `avail_zone`, and `num_servers` as arguments, but the function signature does not specify the data type of these arguments. It's a good practice to specify the data type of function arguments in the function signature to make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Variable naming:
The code uses variable names like ` servers`, `fips`, and `server_ssh_clients` that are not very descriptive. It's a good practice to use more descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand.
6. Function logic:
The `create_vms` function creates two virtual machines and associates a floating IP address with each virtual machine. The function logic is a bit complex, and it's not immediately clear what the function does just by looking at its name. It's a good practice to break down the function into smaller functions each with a single responsibility to make the code easier to understand and maintain.
7. Test case:
The test case `test_two_vms_fips` is not very descriptive. It's a good practice to use more descriptive test case names that clearly indicate what the test case is testing.
8. Test case logic:
The test case logic is a bit complex, and it's not immediately clear what the test case is testing just by looking at its name. It's a good practice to break down the test case into smaller test cases each with a single responsibility to make the code easier to understand and maintain.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and I don't see any glaring security defects. However, following the best practices mentioned above can make the code more readable, maintainable, and secure.
