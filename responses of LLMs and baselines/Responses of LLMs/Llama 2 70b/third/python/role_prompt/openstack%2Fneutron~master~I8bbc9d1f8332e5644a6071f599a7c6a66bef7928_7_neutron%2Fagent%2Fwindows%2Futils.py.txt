 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few best practices that could be applied to the code:

1. Consistent coding style: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints: The function definitions lack type hints for the parameters and return types. Adding type hints can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Docstrings: The code lacks docstrings for the functions. Docstrings can provide a brief description of the function's purpose, parameters, return types, and any other relevant information.
4. Error handling: The code uses a bare except block in some places, which can mask important error information. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately.
5. Logging: The code uses logging, but the log messages are not very informative. It's better to include more context and details in the log messages, such as the command being executed, the process ID, and any error messages.
6. Security: The code uses `subprocess` to execute commands, which can be a security risk if the commands are not properly sanitized. It's better to use a secure method to execute commands, such as `subprocess.check_output` or `subprocess.run`.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to understand. Following best practices can make the code more maintainable, readable, and secure.
