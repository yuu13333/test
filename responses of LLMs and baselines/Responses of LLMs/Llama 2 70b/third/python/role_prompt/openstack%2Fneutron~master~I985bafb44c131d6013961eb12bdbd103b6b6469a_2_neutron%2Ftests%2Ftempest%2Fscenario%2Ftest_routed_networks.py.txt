 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and consistency.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's better to use them consistently throughout the code to make it easier to understand and maintain.
3. docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions and classes. Docstrings help provide context and information about the purpose and parameters of a function or class. Adding docstrings can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
4. Function signature:
The function signature for _create_server() and _create_subnet() is not consistent. It's better to make the signatures consistent to improve readability.
5. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as "phy_network" and "network_type," are not very descriptive. It's better to use more descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand.
6. Function logic:
The _create_routed_network() function has a complex logic. It's better to break down the logic into smaller functions to make it easier to understand and maintain.
7. Comments:
The code lacks comments in some places. Comments help provide context and information about the purpose of a function or block of code. Adding comments can make the code more readable and easier to understand.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but following consistent naming conventions, adding type hints and annotations, docstrings, and comments can make it more readable and easier to maintain.
