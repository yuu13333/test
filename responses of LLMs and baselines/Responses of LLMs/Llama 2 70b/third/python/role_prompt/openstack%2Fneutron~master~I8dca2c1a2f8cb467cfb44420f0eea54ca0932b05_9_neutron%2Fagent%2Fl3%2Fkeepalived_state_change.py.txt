 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations sparingly. Adding more type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions and classes. Adding docstrings can help provide context and information about the purpose and usage of each function and class.
4. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have inconsistent signatures, such as `handle_initial_state` and `send_garp`. It's better to standardize function signatures to improve code readability.
5. Exception handling:
The code catches generic exceptions like `Exception` and logs the error message. However, it's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, rather than catching all exceptions and handling them generically.
6. Logging:
The code uses both `logging` and `LOG` for logging. It's better to stick to a single logging mechanism for consistency.
7. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to manage and maintain. It's better to break the code into smaller modules and files to improve code organization and maintainability.
8. Testing:
The code lacks tests, which can make it difficult to ensure that the code functions correctly. Adding tests can help catch bugs and improve code quality.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and I didn't find any glaring security defects. However, following best practices and improving code quality can make the code more maintainable and reliable.
