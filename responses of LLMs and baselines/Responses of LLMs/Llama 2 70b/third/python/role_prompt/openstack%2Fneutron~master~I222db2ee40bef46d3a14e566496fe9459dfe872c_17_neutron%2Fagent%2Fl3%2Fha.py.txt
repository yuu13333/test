 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are not consistent. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations sparingly. Adding more type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The code has limited docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and parameters of functions, classes, and methods. Adding docstrings can improve code readability and help others understand the code better.
4. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are short and unclear. Consider using shorter and more descriptive function names to improve code readability.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple classes and functions, but it could be further refactored to improve readability and maintainability. Consider breaking down long classes and functions into smaller, more manageable pieces.
6. Comments:
The code has limited comments, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and logic of certain sections. Adding comments can improve code readability and help others understand the code better.
7. Error handling:
The code has limited error handling, which can lead to unexpected errors or behavior. Consider adding more error handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks, to improve code reliability.
8. Testing:
The code does not include any testing functions or code. Adding tests can help ensure that the code functions correctly and catch any bugs or errors before they reach production.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and organized, but there is room for improvement in terms of consistency, readability, and maintainability.
