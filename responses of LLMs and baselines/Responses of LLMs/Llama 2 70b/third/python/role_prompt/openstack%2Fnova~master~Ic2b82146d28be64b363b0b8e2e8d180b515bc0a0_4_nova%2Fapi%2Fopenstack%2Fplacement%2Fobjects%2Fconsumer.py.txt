 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and organization:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
In some places, the code uses camelCase naming conventions (e.g., "consumer_obj"), while in other places, it uses snake_case (e.g., "project_external_id"). It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's better to add type hints and annotations for all function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Function docstrings:
Some functions lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and any exceptions they may raise. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions, especially for public functions that may be used by other parts of the codebase.
4. Function naming conventions:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive (e.g., "create_incomplete_consumers"), while others are shorter and less descriptive (e.g., "get_by_uuid"). It's better to use descriptive names for all functions, especially for public functions that may be used by other parts of the codebase.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into several nested modules, which can make it difficult to understand and navigate. It may be helpful to break the code into smaller, more focused modules or classes, each with its own clear responsibilities and functions.
6. Comments and docstrings:
The code has some comments and docstrings, but they could be improved. It's a good practice to add comments and docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules, especially for public functions and classes that may be used by other parts of the codebase. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
7. Consistency in error handling:
The code uses different ways to handle errors, such as raising NovaException or logging errors and returning None. It's better to handle errors consistently throughout the code, either by raising exceptions or logging and returning specific error values.
8. Consistency in variable naming:
The code uses different naming conventions for variables, such as "consumer" vs. "consumer_obj". It's better to use consistent naming conventions throughout the code.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to read, but there are some areas where it could be improved for better readability, organization, and consistency.
