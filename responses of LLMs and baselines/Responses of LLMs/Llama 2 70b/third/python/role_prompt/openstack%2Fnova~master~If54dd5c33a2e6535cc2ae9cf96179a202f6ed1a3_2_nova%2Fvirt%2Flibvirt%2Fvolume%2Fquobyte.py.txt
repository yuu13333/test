 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations will make the code more readable and easier to understand, and will also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings will improve the code's readability and help others understand how to use the functions.
4. Error handling:
The code catches some exceptions but doesn't handle them properly. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, rather than catching a broad exception like "Exception" and logging an unclear message.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which makes it difficult to read and maintain. It's better to break the code into smaller files or modules, each with its own clear purpose and responsibilities. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
6. Consistency in indentation and spacing:
The code has inconsistent indentation and spacing, which makes it difficult to read. It's better to follow a consistent style guide to improve readability.
7. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have a redundant "self" parameter, while others don't. It's better to be consistent with the function signatures and remove the redundant "self" parameters where possible.
8. Variable naming:
Some variable names are not descriptive, such as "data" and "mount_path". It's better to use more descriptive names to improve readability and understandability.
9. Redundant code:
The code has some redundant code, such as the "umount_volume" function, which is similar to the "disconnect_volume" function. It's better to remove the redundant code and use a single function for both purposes.
10. Code style:
The code has some code style issues, such as inconsistent line length, inconsistent use of spaces vs. tabs, and missing newline characters. It's better to follow a consistent style guide to improve readability and maintainability.
