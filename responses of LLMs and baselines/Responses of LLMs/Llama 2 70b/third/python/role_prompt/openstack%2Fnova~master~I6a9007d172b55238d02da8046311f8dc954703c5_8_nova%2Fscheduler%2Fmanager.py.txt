 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured, and it is clear what each section is responsible for. The use of consistent naming conventions and docstrings makes the code easy to read and understand.

However, there are a few minor suggestions that could improve the code:

1. Inconsistent spacing: There are inconsistent spaces between lines, especially in the last few lines of the code. It is better to maintain consistent spacing throughout the code for better readability.
2. Unused imports: The code imports 'stevedore' and 'nova.i18n', but they are not used anywhere in the code. It is better to remove unused imports to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
3. Redundant 'return' statement: In the 'select_destinations' method, there is a redundant 'return' statement at the end of the 'else' block. It can be removed since the 'return' statement at the end of the 'if' block will always be executed.
4. Missing docstring: The 'update_aggregates' method is missing a docstring. It is recommended to add a docstring to describe the purpose and parameters of the method.
5. Inconsistent parameter naming: The 'select_destinations' method has inconsistent parameter naming. Some parameters are camelCase, while others are separated by underscores. It is better to use consistent naming conventions throughout the code.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, and there are no security defects detected.
