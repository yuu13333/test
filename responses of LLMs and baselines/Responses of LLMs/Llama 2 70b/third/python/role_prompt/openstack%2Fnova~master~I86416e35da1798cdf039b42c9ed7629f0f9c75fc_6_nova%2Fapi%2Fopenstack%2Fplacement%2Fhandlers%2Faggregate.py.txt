 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
The docstrings are missing for some functions, which can make it difficult to understand the purpose and parameters of the functions. Adding docstrings can improve the readability and understandability of the code.
4. Error handling:
The code only handles errors partially, and some parts of the code are missing error handling altogether. It's essential to handle errors and exceptions properly to ensure the code is robust and reliable.
5. Security-related improvements:
Although the code doesn't have any security defects, there are some security-related improvements that can be made:

a. Input validation:
The code doesn't validate the input data properly, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities. It's essential to validate the input data against the expected format and content to prevent potential attacks.

b. Data encryption:
The code doesn't encrypt the data properly, which can expose sensitive information. It's recommended to use encryption to protect sensitive data, especially when it's transmitted over the network.

c. Access control:
The code doesn't have proper access control mechanisms in place. It's essential to implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the resources and data.

d. Logging and auditing:
The code doesn't have proper logging and auditing mechanisms in place. It's essential to log and audit the activities and events to track potential security breaches and maintain compliance with security regulations.
