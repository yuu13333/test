 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and variables lack docstrings that describe their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports the `utils` module from the `neutron.agent.linux` package, but it doesn't seem to be used anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid clutter and potential issues.
4. Unnecessary complexity:
The `test_delete_icmp_entry` and `test_delete_tcp_entry` functions have similar code. Instead of duplicating code, it's better to extract a common function that can handle both cases.
5. Missing error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly. For example, if the `conntrack` command fails, the code raises a generic `Exception` instead of a specific error message. It's better to catch specific errors and handle them appropriately.
6. Hardcoded IP addresses and ports:
The code uses hardcoded IP addresses and ports that may not be appropriate for all environments. It's better to use variables or configuration files to store these values.
7. Unnecessary comments:
Some comments are not necessary and can be removed. For example, the comment "Creates non existed zone_id" is not needed, as the function name already describes its purpose.
8. Missing blank lines:
The code lacks blank lines between functions, which can make it harder to read. Adding blank lines can improve readability and make the code more visually appealing.
