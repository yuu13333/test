 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings: Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose and parameters. It's important to include docstrings to make the code more readable and understandable.
3. Use of 'secret' variable: The 'secret' variable is used to store a masked token, but it's not clear why it's needed. It's better to eliminate unnecessary variables to reduce complexity.
4. Use of 'utils.mask_token' function: The 'utils.mask_token' function is used to mask a token, but it's not clear what this function does or why it's needed. It's better to provide a clear explanation or documentation for this function.
5. Use of 'eventlet.hubs.use_hub' function: The 'eventlet.hubs.use_hub' function is used to ensure that the eventlet hub is properly initialized. However, it's not clear why this is necessary or what the consequences are if it's not called. It's better to provide a clear explanation or documentation for this function.
6. Missing error handling: The code has several places where errors are raised without proper error handling. It's important to handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages to the user.
7. Use of 'socket.MSG_PEEK' flag: The 'socket.MSG_PEEK' flag is used to peek at the incoming data without removing it from the buffer. However, it's not clear why this is necessary or what the consequences are if it's not used. It's better to provide a clear explanation or documentation for this flag.
8. Use of 'websockify.ProxyRequestHandler' class: The 'websockify.ProxyRequestHandler' class is used to handle WebSocket requests. However, it's not clear why this class is necessary or what it does differently than the 'NovaProxyRequestHandler' class. It's better to provide a clear explanation or documentation for this class.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, there are some areas where improvements can be made to make the code more readable, understandable, and secure.
