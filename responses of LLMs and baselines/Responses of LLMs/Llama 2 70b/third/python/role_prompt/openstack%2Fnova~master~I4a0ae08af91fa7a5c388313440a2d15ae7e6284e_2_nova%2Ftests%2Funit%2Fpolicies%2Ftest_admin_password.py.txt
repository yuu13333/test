 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
In the code, there are different naming conventions used for variables and functions. It's better to follow consistent naming conventions throughout the code. For example, in some places, the variable name is in camelCase, while in other places, it's in snake_case. It's better to stick to one convention.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations sparingly. It's a good practice to include type hints and annotations for all variables and functions, especially in a Python code. This will help other developers understand the code better and make maintenance easier.
3. Docstrings:
The code doesn't have docstrings for most of the functions and classes. Docstrings are useful for understanding the purpose and behavior of a function or class. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions and classes.
4. Comments:
The code has limited comments. While the code is well-structured, it's not always clear what a particular line or block of code does. Adding comments will help other developers understand the code better and make maintenance easier.
5. Testing:
The code has a good set of tests, but it's always a good practice to have more tests for different scenarios. Additionally, it's a good idea to test the code with different inputs and edge cases to ensure that it behaves as expected.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, it's always a good idea to follow consistent naming conventions, include type hints and annotations, docstrings, and comments, and write more tests for different scenarios.
