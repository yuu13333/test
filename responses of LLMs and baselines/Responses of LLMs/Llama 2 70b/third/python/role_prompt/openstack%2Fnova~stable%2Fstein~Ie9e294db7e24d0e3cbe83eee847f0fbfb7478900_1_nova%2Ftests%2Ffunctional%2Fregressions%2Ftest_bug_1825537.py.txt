 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent coding style:
In line 14, the import statement for `integrated_helpers` is not consistent with the other import statements. It should be moved to the top of the file, and the intervening blank line should be removed.
2. Docstring convention:
The docstring convention in the code is inconsistent. Some docstrings are written in camelCase, while others are in underscore notation. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
3. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not annotated with type hints. Adding type hints can make the code more readable and easier to understand, and can also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
4. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as `dest_host` and `source_rp_uuid`, are not very descriptive. It's better to use more descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand.
5. Function signature:
The function signature of `_resize_and_assert_error` is quite long and complex. It may be better to break it down into smaller functions each with a single responsibility, to make the code easier to read and understand.
6. Assertion message:
In line 50, the assertion message is not very descriptive. It's better to use a more descriptive message that explains the expected behavior, to make the test more understandable.
7. Test organization:
The test is organized in a way that makes it difficult to understand the overall flow of the test. It may be better to break the test into smaller test cases, each with a single responsibility, to make the test more modular and easier to understand.
8. Flavor naming:
The flavors are hardcoded in the test. It's better to use configurable variables for the flavor names, to make the test more flexible and easier to maintain.

These are just suggestions for improvement, and do not affect the security of the code.
