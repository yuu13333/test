 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code quality and readability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable definitions. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand, and also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
Adding docstrings to functions and classes can help provide context and explanations for the code, making it easier for others to understand what the code does and how it works.
4. Code organization:
The code is organized into different sections, but some sections are quite long. Consider breaking down the code into smaller functions or classes to make it easier to read and maintain.
5. Comments:
Adding comments to the code can help explain complex sections or logic, making it easier for others to understand what the code does and how it works.
6. Tests:
The code has a good set of tests, but consider adding more tests to cover different scenarios and edge cases. This will help ensure that the code is robust and works as expected.
7. Code style:
Consider using a consistent code style throughout the code. For example, you can use consistent indentation, spacing, and formatting for functions, variables, and control flow statements.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and the tests cover a good set of scenarios. However, implementing the suggestions above can further improve the code's readability, maintainability, and robustness.
