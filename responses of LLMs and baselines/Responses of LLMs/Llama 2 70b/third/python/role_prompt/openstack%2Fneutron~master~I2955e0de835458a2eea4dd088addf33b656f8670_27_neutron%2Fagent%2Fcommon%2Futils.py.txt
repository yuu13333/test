 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and any other relevant information. Adding docstrings would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Type hints:
The code uses type hints for some function parameters and return types, but not consistently. It's a good practice to use type hints for all function parameters and return types to make the code more readable and to catch type-related errors early.
4. Function signature:
The `load_interface_driver` function takes a `conf` parameter, but it's not clear what type of object `conf` should be. It would be helpful to specify the type of `conf` in the function signature.
5. Exception handling:
The `load_interface_driver` function raises a `SystemExit` exception if the driver cannot be loaded. However, it's not clear why this function needs to raise such an exception. It would be better to catch the `ImportError` exception and handle it appropriately, for example, by logging the error and continuing with a default driver or a warning message.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into different sections, but some sections are not clearly defined. It would be helpful to break the code into smaller functions or classes to make it easier to understand and maintain.
7. Comments:
Some parts of the code have comments that are not clear or up-to-date. It's a good practice to review and update comments regularly to ensure that they accurately reflect the code's functionality.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, addressing these minor issues would make the code more readable, maintainable, and secure.
