 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The docstrings in the code are not consistent. Some docstrings are in the form of sentences, while others are in the form of bullet points. It's better to use consistent formatting for docstrings.
3. Deprecated rules:
The code has deprecated rules with a reason and a version number. It's good practice to include a reference to the documentation or a link to the relevant GitHub issue for the deprecated rule, so that users can easily find more information about the deprecation.
4. Scope types:
The code uses the `scope_types` parameter in some policies, but it's not clear what this parameter does. It would be helpful to include a comment explaining the purpose of this parameter.
5. Consistency in indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines have four spaces, while others have eight spaces. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code.
6. Trailing commas:
Some of the lists in the code have trailing commas, while others do not. It's better to be consistent and include trailing commas in all lists.
7. Missing `oslo_policy` import:
The code imports `oslo_policy` but does not use it anywhere. It's better to remove the unused import to avoid confusion.
8. Unused variable:
The code defines a variable `BASE_POLICY_NAME` but does not use it anywhere. It's better to remove the unused variable to avoid confusion.
