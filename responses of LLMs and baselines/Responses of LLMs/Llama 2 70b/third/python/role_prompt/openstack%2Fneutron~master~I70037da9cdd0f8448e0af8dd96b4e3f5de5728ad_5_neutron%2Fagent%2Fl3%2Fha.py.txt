 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and organization:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use separate words with underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations for some variables and functions, but not for all. It's a good practice to add type hints and annotations for all variables and functions to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
The code has docstrings for some functions, but not for all. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions to provide a brief description of what the function does and what its inputs and outputs are.
4. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are shorter and less descriptive. It's better to use descriptive names for all functions to make the code easier to understand.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into different sections, but some sections have a lot of code and it's not always clear what the code does just by looking at the section name. It's a good practice to break down long sections into smaller functions or classes to make the code easier to understand and maintain.
6. Comments:
The code has some comments, but they are not always clear or descriptive. It's a good practice to add clear and descriptive comments for all code sections to explain what the code does
