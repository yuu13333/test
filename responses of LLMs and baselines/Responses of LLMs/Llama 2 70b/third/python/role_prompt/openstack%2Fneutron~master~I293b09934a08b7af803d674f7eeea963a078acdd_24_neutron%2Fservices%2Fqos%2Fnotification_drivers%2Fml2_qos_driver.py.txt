 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for variable names and snake_case for function names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable definitions. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future.
3. Function docstrings:
It's a good practice to include docstrings for functions that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and any other relevant information. This will help developers understand the code without having to read through the entire function implementation.
4. Consistent indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation in some places, such as the last few lines of the file. It's important to ensure consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.
5. Comments and documentation:
The code has minimal comments and documentation. Adding comments and documentation can help developers understand the code's purpose, functionality, and any constraints or assumptions that were made during development.
6. Refactoring:
The code has a lot of repetitive code, especially in the _validate_port_rules_supported function. You can consider refactoring the code to extract common functionality and reduce duplication. This will make the code more maintainable and easier to modify in the future.

Overall, the code seems well-structured, and the author has made a good effort to follow best practices. With a few improvements, the code can be even more readable and maintainable for other developers.
