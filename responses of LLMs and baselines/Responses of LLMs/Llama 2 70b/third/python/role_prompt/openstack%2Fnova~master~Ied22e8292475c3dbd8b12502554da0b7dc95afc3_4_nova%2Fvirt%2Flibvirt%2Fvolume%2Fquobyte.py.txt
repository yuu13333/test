 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variables are camelCase, while others are separate words. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Error handling:
The code catches generic exceptions like `ProcessExecutionError` and `OSError`, but it's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately. For example, instead of catching `ProcessExecutionError` and logging an error message, it's better to catch `subprocess.CalledProcessError` and handle the error message specifically.
3. Logging:
The code uses both `logging` and `LOG` for logging. It's better to stick to a single logging mechanism for consistency. Additionally, it's a good practice to log errors and exceptions separately, so that it's easier to track issues.
4. Function naming:
Some function names are not descriptive, making it difficult to understand their purpose. For example, `validate_and_wait` is not a descriptive name, and it's not clear what the function does just by looking at its name. It's better to use descriptive names that indicate the function's purpose.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into separate functions, but it's not clear how they fit together. It's better to group related functions together and use descriptive names for the functions and the classes they belong to. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
6. Type hints:
The code uses type hints for some variables and functions, but not for others. It's better to use type hints consistently throughout the code to make it easier to understand the data types and to catch type-related errors early.
7. Code style:
The code uses inconsistent indentation and spacing. It's better to follow a consistent coding style throughout the code to make it easier to read and maintain.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there are some areas where it can be improved for better readability, maintainability, and security.
