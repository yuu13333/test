 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are not consistent. For example, some variable names are camelCase, while others are separate words. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not annotated. Adding type hints and annotations will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for the functions, classes, and variables. Adding docstrings will help provide context and make the code easier to understand.
4. Function signature:
The `ids_from_instance` function takes a `context` parameter, but it's not used anywhere in the function. Consider removing the unused parameter or documenting why it's necessary.
5. Consistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines are indented with four spaces, while others are indented with eight spaces. It's better to stick to a single indentation size throughout the code.
6. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of the code, particularly in the `Quotas` class, will make it easier to understand.
7. Class inheritance:
The `QuotasNoOp` class inherits from the `Quotas` class but doesn't use any of the inherited methods. Instead, it defines its own methods with the same name. This can lead to confusion and makes the code harder to understand. Consider refactoring the code to avoid this inheritance relationship or use the inherited methods.
8. Function logic:
The `check_deltas` function has a complex logic that's difficult to follow. Consider breaking the function into smaller functions or methods to make it easier to understand and maintain.
9. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as `proj_values` and `user_values`, are not descriptive. Consider using more descriptive names to make the code easier to understand.
10. Code organization:
The code is organized into different sections, but it's not clear how they relate to each other. Consider organizing the code into smaller modules or classes to make it easier to understand and maintain.

Overall, the code appears to be secure, but following best practices for code organization, naming conventions, and documentation will make it easier to understand and maintain.
