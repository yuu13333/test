 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's functionality or performance:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally a good idea to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the codebase.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the functions and classes in the code do not have docstrings. Docstrings can help provide context and explanations for the code, making it easier for others to understand and maintain. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions and classes.
3. Unused imports:
The code has some unused imports, such as `nova.exception`. While this may not be a security issue, it could indicate that some parts of the code are not being used or are not necessary. It's a good practice to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
4. Unnecessary complexity:
The code has some complex logic, such as the `try`-`except` block in the `create` method, which may make it harder to understand and maintain. It's a good practice to simplify the code where possible and avoid unnecessary complexity.
5. Missing tests:
The code does not include any tests, which could make it harder to ensure that it functions correctly. It's a good practice to include tests for all code to ensure that it works as intended and to catch any potential bugs or issues.
