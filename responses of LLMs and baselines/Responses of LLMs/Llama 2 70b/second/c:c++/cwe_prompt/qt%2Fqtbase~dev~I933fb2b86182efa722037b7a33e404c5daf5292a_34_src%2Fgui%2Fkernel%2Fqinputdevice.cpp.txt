 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses the `QMutexLocker` class, which is not a standard C++ class. It is part of the Qt library, and it is used to acquire and release locks on mutexes. It is important to ensure that the code is using the correct mutexes and that the locks are being acquired and released correctly to avoid race conditions and other synchronization issues.

Additionally, the code uses the `QBasicMutex` class, which is also not a standard C++ class. It is part of the Qt library, and it is used to implement a basic mutex. It is important to ensure that the code is using the correct mutexes and that the locks are being acquired and released correctly to avoid race conditions and other synchronization issues.

It is also worth noting that the code uses the `qAddPostRoutine` and `qRemovePostRoutine` functions, which are part of the Qt library. These functions are used to schedule a function to be called after a certain interval or when a certain event occurs. It is important to ensure that the code is using these functions correctly and that the functions being scheduled are properly cleaned up when they are no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, it is important to ensure that the code is using the correct synchronization mechanisms and that the code is properly cleaned up to avoid potential issues.
