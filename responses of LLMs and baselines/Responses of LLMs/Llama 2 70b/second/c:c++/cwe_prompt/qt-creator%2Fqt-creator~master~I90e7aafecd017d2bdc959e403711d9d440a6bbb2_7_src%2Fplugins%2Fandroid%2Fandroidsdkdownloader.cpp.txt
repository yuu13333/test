 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Unused variables and functions:
	* The variable "m_manager" is never used.
	* The function "sslErrors" is never called.
	* The variable "m_progressDialog" is never used.
	* The function "cancel" is never called.
3. Unnecessary includes:
	* The include "QDirIterator" is not used in the code.
	* The include "QStandardPaths" is only used for the function "getSaveFilename", which can be moved to a separate file.
4. Missing documentation:
	* The function "getSaveFilename" is not documented.
	* The variable "m_sdkFilename" is not documented.
5. Code organization:
	* The code is organized into multiple nested namespaces, which can make it difficult to read and understand. It's better to use a more flat namespace structure.
6. Error handling:
	* The code does not handle errors properly. For example, if the download fails, the error is not propagated up the call stack, and the function "downloadFinished" will still be called.
7. Security:
	* The code does not validate the SSL certificate of the download server. This could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.
8. Code style:
	* The code uses both curly brace styles (Allman and Whitesmiths). It's better to stick to a single style.
9. Unused code:
	* The function "isHttpRedirect" is never used.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there are some improvements that can be made to make it more maintainable, readable, and secure.
