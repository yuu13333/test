 I have reviewed the code and did not find any security defects. The code seems to be well-structured, and it uses modern C++ features such as nullptr, std::exchange, and QScopedPointer to ensure memory safety.

The code also follows good practices for file and directory manipulation, such as using QDir for directory operations and QTemporaryDirPrivate for managing temporary directories.

Additionally, the code includes a thorough license header that specifies the terms of use for the software, which is important for open-source projects like Qt.

Overall, I did not find any security defects in the code, and it appears to be well-written and secure.
