 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. The code uses both `QMap` and `std::map` simultaneously, which may introduce complexity and potential issues. It's better to stick to one container throughout the code.
2. In `insertion_int_int()` and `insertion_int_intx()`, the same benchmark is run twice with different names. This could be refactored into a single function and renamed to avoid duplication.
3. In `insertion_string_int2()` and `insertion_string_int2_hint()`, the `XString` class is used, which implements an expensive `operator <`. This could be optimized by using a simpler comparison method or avoiding the use of `XString` altogether.
4. In `insertMap()`, the `QMap` class is used with a custom comparison function, which may impact performance. It's worth considering using a different data structure or optimizing the comparison function for better performance.
5. The code includes a `QTEST_MAIN` macro, which is not necessary in this case since the `tst_QMap` class already contains a `QObject` macro. The `QTEST_MAIN` macro can be removed to simplify the code.
6. The code uses both `QBENCHMARK` and `QBENCHMARK_ONCE` macros. `QBENCHMARK_ONCE` is only necessary when the benchmark is run once, which is not the case here. The `QBENCHMARK_ONCE` macro can be removed, and the `QBENCHMARK` macro can be used instead.
7. Some functions, such as `ucs4lloWorld`, are not used in the code. It's better to remove unused functions and variables to avoid confusion and improve code quality.
8. The code uses `const` correctness inconsistently. It's better to use `const` wherever possible to ensure thread safety and prevent accidental changes to data.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, there are some areas where improvements can be
