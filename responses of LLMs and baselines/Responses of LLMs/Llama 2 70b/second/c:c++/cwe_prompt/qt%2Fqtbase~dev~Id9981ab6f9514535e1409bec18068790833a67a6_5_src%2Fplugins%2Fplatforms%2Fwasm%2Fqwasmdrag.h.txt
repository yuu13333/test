 I have reviewed the code and found a potential security defect.

The defect is located in the `qWasmDrop()` function, which is not properly sanitizing user-supplied data. The function takes a `QPoint` argument, `globalPos`, which is used to construct a `QDropEvent` object. However, the `QDropEvent` constructor takes a raw pointer to a `QPoint` object, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the pointer is not properly validated.

Here is an example of how the vulnerability could be exploited:

1. An attacker creates a malicious QWasmDrag object and sets the `m_qButton` member variable to a non-zero value.
2. The attacker then calls the `move()` function, passing in a crafted `QPoint` object that contains a pointer to malicious data.
3. The `move()` function will then call the `qWasmDrop()` function, passing in the crafted `QPoint` object as an argument.
4. The `qWasmDrop()` function will construct a `QDropEvent` object using the crafted `QPoint` object, which will contain a reference to the malicious data.
5. The `QDropEvent` object will then be processed by the application, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code.

To fix this vulnerability, the `qWasmDrop()` function should validate the input `QPoint` object to ensure that it does not contain any malicious data. One way to do this is to use the `QPoint::isValid()` function to check if the point is within the bounds of the screen. If the point is not valid, the function should abort the drop operation and return.

Here is an example of how the fixed `qWasmDrop()` function could look like:
```
void QWasmDrag::qWasmDrop()
{
    QPoint globalPos = QPoint::fromGlobal(QCursor::pos());
    if (!globalPos.isValid()) {
        return;
    }
    // Rest of the function implementation
}
```
Additionally, it's a good practice to validate all user-supplied data and sanitize it to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.

In summary, the security defect found in the code is a potential use-after-free vulnerability in the `qWasmDrop()` function. The function should validate the input `QPoint` object to ensure that it does not contain any malicious data.
