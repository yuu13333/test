 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's maintainability and readability:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The codebase uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. While this does not impact security, it may make the code harder to read and understand. It's generally a good idea to stick to a single naming convention throughout the codebase.
2. Missing documentation:
Some functions and classes lack documentation. Adding documentation comments can help developers understand the purpose and usage of the code, making it easier to maintain and modify.
3. Unused variables and functions:
There are a few unused variables and functions in the code. While this does not directly impact security, it can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It's a good practice to remove unused code or comment it out to avoid confusion.
4. Redundant code:
The `addFirstItem` function seems to be doing the same thing as the `buildTree` function. It might be worth considering merging these two functions into a single function to reduce code duplication.
5. Compiler warnings:
The code may benefit from addressing some of the compiler warnings, such as "unused variable" or "unused function" warnings. Addressing these warnings can help improve code quality and reduce the likelihood of errors or security vulnerabilities.
6. Consistency in indentation and formatting:
The codebase uses different indentation and formatting styles. While this does not directly impact security, it can make the code harder to read and understand. It's generally a good idea to follow a consistent style guide to improve code readability.

Again, these are minor issues that may not directly impact security but can still improve the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.
