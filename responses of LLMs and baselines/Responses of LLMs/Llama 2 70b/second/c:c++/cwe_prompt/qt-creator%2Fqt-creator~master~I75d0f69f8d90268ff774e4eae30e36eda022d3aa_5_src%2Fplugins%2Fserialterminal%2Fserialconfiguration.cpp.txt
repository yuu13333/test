 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out some potential issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to the functions, classes, and variables to explain their purpose and usage.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions, such as `m_reconnectTimer` and `tryReconnect()`. It's better to remove them or use them appropriately to avoid confusion and unused code.
4. Error handling:
The code has a complex error handling mechanism, with multiple error codes and messages. It would be better to consolidate the error handling into a single centralized location, such as a custom exception class, to make the code easier to understand and maintain.
5. Consistency in formatting:
The code has inconsistent formatting, with different indentation levels and spacing. It's better to use a consistent formatting style throughout the code to improve readability.
6. Use of `Q_OBJECT`:
The code uses `Q_OBJECT` macro to create a QObject subclass, but it's not necessary in this case since the class doesn't need to inherit from QObject. Instead, the class can directly inherit from QSerialPort.
7. Use of `QMetaObject::invokeMethod`:
The code uses `QMetaObject::invokeMethod` to call the `start` and `stop` functions. However, it's better to use a signal-slot connection to communicate between objects instead of using `QMetaObject::invokeMethod`.
8. Use of `QByteArray`:
The code uses `QByteArray` to store the data to be written to the serial port. However, it's better to use a `QString` instead since the data is string-based.
9. Use of `qint64`:
The code uses `qint64` to store the number of bytes written to the serial port. However, it's better to use a `qint32` instead since the maximum number of bytes that can be written is 2^32-1.
10. Missing include statements:
The code is missing include statements for some of the classes and functions used, such as `QSerialPort` and `Utils::OutputFormatter`. It's better to include the necessary headers to avoid compilation errors and improve code readability.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and the issues mentioned above are minor and can be easily addressed.
