 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, 'WindowList' should be 'WindowList' or 'windowList', but not both.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add comments and documentation to the code to make it easier for others to understand and maintain. For example, what is the purpose of the 'WindowList' class? What are the responsibilities of the 'WindowSupport' class?
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions. For example, the 'useMacShortcuts' variable is never used, and the 'updateFullScreenAction' function is only called once. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code maintenance.
4. Complexity:
The code has a high level of complexity, with many interconnected classes and functions. It's better to break down the code into smaller, more manageable pieces, and use simpler design patterns to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Error handling:
The code lacks proper error handling. For example, what happens if 'ActionManager::registerAction' or 'ICore::addContextObject' fails? It's better to add error handling and exception handling to ensure the code is robust and can handle unexpected situations.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple namespaces and classes, but it's not clear how they relate to each other. It's better to organize the code into a more logical structure, with clear relationships between the classes and namespaces.
7. Code style:
The code has some inconsistencies in code style, such as inconsistent indentation, missing braces, and unnecessary comments. It's better to follow a consistent code style throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.

Overall, while the code appears to be secure, it can be improved in terms of readability, maintainability, and organization.
