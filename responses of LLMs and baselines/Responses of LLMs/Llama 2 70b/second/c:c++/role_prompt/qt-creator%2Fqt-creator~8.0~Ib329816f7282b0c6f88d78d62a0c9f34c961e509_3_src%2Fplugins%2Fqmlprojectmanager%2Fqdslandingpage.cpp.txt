 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
The code uses both CamelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code.
2. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of the code, especially in the QdsLandingPage class, will make it easier for others to understand and maintain.
3. Function naming:
Some function names are very long and descriptive, while others are very short. Try to be consistent with function naming conventions. For example, instead of "show," "hide," "setQdsInstalled," and "setProjectFileExists," you could use "showWidget," "hideWidget," "setQdsInstalledFlag," and "setProjectFileExistsFlag."
4. Variable naming:
Some variable names are descriptive, while others are not. For example, "m_qdsInstalled" and "m_projectFileExists" are descriptive, but "m_widget" and "m_cmakeResources" are not. Try to use more descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand.
5. Qt version and QDS version:
The code uses both Qt version and QDS version. It's better to use only one version number and keep the other as a comment or a constant.
6. CmakeResources:
The function setCmakeResources takes a Utils::FilePaths parameter, but it's not used anywhere. Instead, the function uses a QStringList to store the resource paths. It's better to use the Utils::FilePaths parameter and avoid the unnecessary conversion.
7. signal/slot connections:
The code connects signals and slots using the "connect" function. It's better to use the newer syntax, "QObject::connect," which is less error-prone and provides better type safety.
8. qmlRegisterSingletonInstance:
The function qmlRegisterSingletonInstance is not necessary, as the QdsLandingPage class is not a QML component. Instead, you can use the QmlProjectManager::registerSingletonInstance function to register the QdsLandingPage class as a singleton.
9. QObject::move:
The code uses QObject::move to move the QdsLandingPage widget to the parent widget. However, QObject::move is not necessary in this case, as the widget is not being moved between threads. Instead, you can use the QWidget::move function to move the widget.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and I don't see any security defects. However, following the suggestions above will make the code more consistent, easier to read, and easier to maintain.
