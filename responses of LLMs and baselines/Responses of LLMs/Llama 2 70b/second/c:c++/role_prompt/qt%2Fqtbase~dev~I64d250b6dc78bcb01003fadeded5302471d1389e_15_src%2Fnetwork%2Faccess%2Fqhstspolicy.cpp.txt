 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. The code uses the `QUrl` class to represent URLs, which is a good choice. However, it's worth considering using the `QUrlQuery` class to represent query strings, as it provides a more convenient interface for parsing and constructing query strings.
2. The `QHstsPolicy` class has a `setHost()` function that takes a `QUrl::ParsingMode` parameter. However, it's not clear what this parameter is used for, as the function only sets the host name of the URL and doesn't seem to use the parsing mode. It might be worth considering removing this parameter and using the default parsing mode for the `QUrl` constructor.
3. The `QHstsPolicy` class has a `host()` function that returns a string representing the host name of the policy. However, it's not clear what the return type of this function should be. It might be worth considering using a `QString` return type instead of `QUrl`, as the function doesn't seem to return a URL object.
4. The `QHstsPolicy` class has a `setExpiry()` function that takes a `QDateTime` parameter. However, it's not clear what the unit of the expiration date should be. It might be worth considering using a `QDateTime` object with the `QDateTime::UTC` flag set, to ensure that the expiration date is in UTC time.
5. The `QHstsPolicy` class has an `isExpired()` function that checks whether the policy has expired. However, it's not clear what the return type of this function should be. It might be worth considering using a `bool` return type instead of a `QDateTime` object, as the function only checks whether the policy has expired and doesn't seem to return a date.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written and secure. However, there are a few minor improvements that could be made to make the code more readable and maintainable.
