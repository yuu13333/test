 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add documentation to the classes, functions, and variables to make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce the risk of errors.
4. Compiler warnings:
The code may generate compiler warnings, such as "warning: unused variable" or "warning: unused function". It's better to address these warnings and remove the unused code.
5. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly. It's better to add proper error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, to handle unexpected errors and provide informative error messages.
6. Security considerations:
The code doesn't seem to have any security considerations, such as input validation, error handling, or encryption. It's important to consider security when developing software to protect against potential vulnerabilities.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to read. However, it's important to address the above-mentioned issues to make the code more maintainable, readable, and secure.
