 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. The code uses the `QueryPerformanceFrequency` and `QueryPerformanceCounter` functions, which are not available on all systems. It would be better to use the `GetTickCount64` function instead, which is available on all systems and provides the same information.
2. The code uses the `LARGE_INTEGER` data type to store the frequency and counter values. However, the `LARGE_INTEGER` data type is not guaranteed to be large enough to hold the values, and it would be better to use the `UINT64` data type instead, which is large enough to hold the values and avoids any potential issues.
3. The code does not handle the case where the `QueryPerformanceFrequency` and `QueryPerformanceCounter` functions fail. It would be better to add error handling to ensure that the code can handle these situations gracefully.
4. The code does not use a consistent naming convention. Some variables and functions use camelCase naming, while others use underscores. It would be better to use a consistent naming convention throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.
5. The code does not include any comments or documentation. It would be helpful to include comments and documentation to explain what the code does and how it works, and to make it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code.
