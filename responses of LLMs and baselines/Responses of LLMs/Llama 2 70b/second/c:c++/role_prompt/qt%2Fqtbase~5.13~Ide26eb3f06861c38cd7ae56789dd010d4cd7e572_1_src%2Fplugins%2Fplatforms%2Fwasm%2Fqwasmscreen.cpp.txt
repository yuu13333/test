 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's behavior or performance:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. While this is not a security issue, it may make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally a good idea to follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks documentation for some functions and classes. Adding documentation can help other developers understand the code's purpose and usage, which can reduce the likelihood of errors and security vulnerabilities.
3. Use of `emscripten::val`: The code uses `emscripten::val` for interacting with the Emscripten environment. While this is not a security issue, it may be worth considering using a more type-safe and modern alternative, such as `emscripten::module` or `emscripten::wasm::module`.
4. Use of `QByteArray`: The code uses `QByteArray` for storing the canvas ID. While this is not a security issue, it may be more efficient to use a `QString` instead, since the canvas ID is a string value.
5. Missing error handling: The code does not handle errors when calling `emscripten_get_element_css_size` and `emscripten::val::global`. Adding error handling can help prevent crashes and improve the code's robustness.
6. Use of `QPlatformCursor`: The code uses `QPlatformCursor` for cursor handling. While this is not a security issue, it may be worth considering using a more modern alternative, such as `QCursor` or `QGuiApplication::cursor`.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and secure. However, addressing the above-mentioned issues can help improve the code's readability, maintainability, and performance.
