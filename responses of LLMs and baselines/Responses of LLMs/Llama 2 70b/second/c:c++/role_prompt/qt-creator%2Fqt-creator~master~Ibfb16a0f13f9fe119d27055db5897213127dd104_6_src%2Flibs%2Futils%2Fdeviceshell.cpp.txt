 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for variable names and underscore for function names.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add documentation to the functions, variables, and classes to make the code readable and understandable for others.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions. For example, the "startupFailed" function is not used anywhere in the code. It's better to remove unused code to avoid confusion and improve code quality.
4. Complicated logic:
The code has some complicated logic, especially in the "runInShell" function. It's better to break down the logic into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Missing error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly. For example, if the "start" function fails, it doesn't provide any error messages or handling. It's better to add proper error handling to ensure that the code can recover from failures gracefully.
6. Dependency on Qt libraries:
The code heavily depends on Qt libraries. Although this is not a security issue, it's essential to consider the implications of using Qt libraries in your project.
7. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it challenging to manage and maintain. It's better to break down the code into smaller files and namespaces to improve organization and readability.

Overall, the code seems to be secure, but following best practices and addressing the above suggestions can improve its quality and maintainability.
