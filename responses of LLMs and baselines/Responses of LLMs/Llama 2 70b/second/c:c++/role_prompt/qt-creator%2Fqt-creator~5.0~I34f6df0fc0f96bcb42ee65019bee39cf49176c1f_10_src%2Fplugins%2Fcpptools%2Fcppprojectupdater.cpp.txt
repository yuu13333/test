 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to the functions and classes to make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.
3. Unused variables: Some variables, such as `m_extraCompilersFutureWatchers`, are not used anywhere in the code. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Unnecessary includes: Some includes, such as `<QFutureWatcher<void>>`, are not necessary and can be removed.
5. Missing return types: Some functions, such as `onProjectInfoGenerated`, do not have a return type specified. It's better to add a return type to make the code more readable and maintainable.
6. Unnecessary pointers: Some pointers, such as `QPointer<ExtraCompiler>`, are not necessary and can be replaced with references or smart pointers.
7. Missing const-correctness: Some functions, such as `update`, take a `const ProjectUpdateInfo &` parameter but modify the `m_projectUpdateInfo` member variable. It's better to make the function const-correct to avoid unexpected side effects.
8. Unnecessary member variables: Some member variables, such as `m_futureSynchronizer`, are not necessary and can be removed.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand. However, following best practices and coding conventions can make the code more maintainable and readable.
