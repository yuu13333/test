 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are not consistent. For example, some variable names are camelCase, while others are separate words. It is best to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code for better readability.
2. Add comments:
Some parts of the code, such as the benchmarking sections, are not well-documented. Adding comments to explain what the code is doing and why would make it easier for others to understand.
3. Use const correctness:
In some places, such as the `insertion_int_int` function, the `map` variable is not declared as `const`. It is good practice to use `const` where possible to prevent accidental modifications to the map.
4. Avoid magic numbers:
In some places, such as the `insertion_int_int` function, magic numbers are used (e.g., `100000`). It is better to define constants for these numbers or use variables to make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Use iterators instead of indices:
In some places, such as the `lookup_int_int` function, the index `i` is used to access elements in the map. It is better to use iterators instead of indices to avoid issues with out-of-bounds errors.
6. Use `QMap::constBegin()` and `QMap::constEnd()`:
Instead of using `QMap::begin()` and `QMap::end()`, it is better to use `QMap::constBegin()` and `QMap::constEnd()` to ensure that the map is not modified accidentally.
7. Use `QMap::insert()` instead of `QMap::insertMulti()`:
In some places, such as the `insertion_string_int2()` function, `QMap::insertMulti()` is used. However, `QMap::insert()` is a better choice because it provides better performance and is less prone to errors.
8. Avoid unnecessary copies of the map:
In some places, such as the `ctorStdMap()` function, an unnecessary copy of the map is created
