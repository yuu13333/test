 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for variable names and underscore for function names.
2. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as "map" and "str," are not very descriptive. It's better to use more descriptive names to make the code easier to understand. For example, you can use "intToInsert" and "stringToInsert" instead of "map" and "str."
3. Function documentation:
The code has several functions that are not documented. It's important to add documentation to functions, especially for the benchmark functions, so that others can understand what the functions do and how they are used.
4. Unused variables:
The code has several unused variables, such as "j" in the "iteration" function. It's better to remove unused variables to make the code cleaner and easier to understand.
5. Redundant code:
The code has some redundant code, such as the "insertion_int_intx" and "insertion_int_int_with_hint1" functions. These functions are similar, and the latter function is not needed. It's better to remove redundant code to make the code more concise.
6. Improper use of "const":
The code uses "const" for some function parameters, but the parameters are not actually constant. For example, in the "insertion_int_int" function, the parameter "i" is not constant, but it's declared as "const int i." It's better to use "int i" instead.
7. Unnecessary loops:
The code has some unnecessary loops, such as the loop in the "ctorStdMap" function. The loop is not needed, and the function can be simplified.
8. Unnecessary includes:
The code includes some unnecessary headers, such as "qdebug.h." It's better to remove unnecessary includes to reduce the size of the code.
9. Redundant benchmarks:
The code has some redundant benchmarks, such as the "insertion_int_int2" and "insertion_int_int_with_hint2" functions. These benchmarks are similar, and the latter function is not needed. It's better to remove redundant benchmarks to make the code more concise.
10. Inconsistent indentation
