 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured and well-written, with proper error handling and encryption usage. It uses the Qt framework's built-in SSL/TLS support, which is a good choice for implementing secure communication in a Qt application.

The server's main loop is properly terminated when the `shutdown` function is called, and the `knownClients` list is properly cleared. The `pskRequired` function is used to handle the PSK (Pre-Shared Key) callback, which is a security feature that allows the server to request a client to provide a pre-shared key for authentication.

The `doHandshake` function is used to handle the DTLS handshake process, which includes the client's hello message, the server's response, and the encryption setup. The function properly checks for errors and handles them appropriately.

The `decryptDatagram` function is used to decrypt received datagrams, and it properly checks for errors and handles them appropriately.

Overall, the code seems to be well-implemented and secure. However, it's always a good idea to review code thoroughly and test it extensively to ensure that it meets all security requirements.
