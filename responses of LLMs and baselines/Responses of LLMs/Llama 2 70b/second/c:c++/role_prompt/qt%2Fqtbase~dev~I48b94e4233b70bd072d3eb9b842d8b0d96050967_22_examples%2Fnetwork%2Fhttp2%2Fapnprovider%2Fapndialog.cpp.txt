 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation: The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to explain the purpose and usage of each function, class, and variable.
3. Unused variables: The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `listViewModel` and `currentCertificatePath`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Complicated logic: The code has a complex structure with many interconnected functions and variables. It would be better to break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions, and to use more descriptive variable names to improve readability.
5. Hardcoded paths: The code hardcodes the path to the SSL certificate file. It's better to use a configurable path or to load the certificate from a secure location, such as a keystore or a secure directory.
6. Insecure SSL configuration: The code sets the `QSslSocket::VerifyNone` mode, which disables SSL verification. This could lead to security vulnerabilities if the server's certificate is not properly verified. It's recommended to use a more secure SSL configuration, such as `QSslSocket::VerifyPeer` or `QSslSocket::VerifyPeerAndChain`.
7. Missing error handling: The code does not handle errors properly. It's better to add error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, to handle unexpected errors and provide informative error messages.
8. Dependency on external libraries: The code uses external libraries, such as `QSslCertificate` and `QSslKey`, which may have security vulnerabilities. It's recommended to use the latest versions of these libraries and to keep them up-to-date.

Overall, the code seems to be secure, but it could benefit from some improvements in terms of readability, maintainability, and security.
