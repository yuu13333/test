 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. The code uses the `Q_DECLARE_PRIVATE` and `Q_DISABLE_COPY_MOVE` macros to declare private members and disable copy and move semantics. While this is not a security issue, it's worth noting that these macros are not needed in this case since the class definitions are already private.
2. The `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` class has a `startMonitoring` function that takes a `QHostAddress` parameter. It would be better to use a `QNetworkAddress` parameter instead, since it provides more flexibility and is less prone to errors.
3. The `QNetworkStatusMonitor` class has a `start` function that is not marked as `virtual`. It's a good practice to mark functions as `virtual` when they are intended to be overridden by subclasses.
4. The `QNetworkStatusMonitor` class has a `isNetworkAccesible` function that returns a `bool` value. It would be better to use a more descriptive name for this function, such as `isNetworkReachable`, to avoid confusion with other functions that may have a similar name.
5. The `QNetworkStatusMonitor` class has a `onlineStateChanged` signal that is not marked as `const`. It's a good practice to mark signals as `const` when they are not intended to be modified by the slot functions.
6. The `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` class has a `reachabilityChanged` signal that is not marked as `const`. It's a good practice to mark signals as `const` when they are not intended to be modified by the slot functions.
7. The code uses the `Q_LOGGING_CATEGORY` macro to declare a logging category. It would be better to use a more descriptive name for the logging category, such as `lcNetworkMonitor`, to provide more context for the logs.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, it's always a good idea to review the code regularly to ensure that it remains secure and up-to-date with the latest coding standards.
