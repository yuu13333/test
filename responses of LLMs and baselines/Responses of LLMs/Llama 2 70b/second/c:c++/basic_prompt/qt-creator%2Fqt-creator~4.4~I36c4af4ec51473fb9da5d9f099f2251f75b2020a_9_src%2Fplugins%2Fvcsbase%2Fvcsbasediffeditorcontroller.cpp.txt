 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation: Some functions and classes lack documentation. It's important to add documentation to make the code more readable and understandable for other developers.
3. Unused variables: The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Unnecessary includes: The code includes some headers that are not necessary for the functionality of the class. It's better to remove them to reduce dependencies and improve build times.
5. Minor formatting issues: There are some minor formatting issues, such as inconsistent indentation and missing whitespace, that could be improved to make the code more readable.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices.
