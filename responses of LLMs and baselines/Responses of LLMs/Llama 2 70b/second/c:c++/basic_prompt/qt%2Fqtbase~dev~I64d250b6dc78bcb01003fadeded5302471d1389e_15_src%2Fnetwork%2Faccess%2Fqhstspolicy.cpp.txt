 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks documentation for some functions, such as `QHstsPolicyPrivate` and `QHstsPolicy::operator==`. It's important to include documentation for all functions to make the code easier to understand and use.
3. Unused variables:
The code defines some unused variables, such as `QHstsPolicyPrivate::url` and `QHstsPolicy::d`. It's better to remove these unused variables to reduce code clutter.
4. Unnecessary constructors:
The code includes constructors that are not needed, such as the copy constructor and move constructor. It's better to remove these constructors to reduce code complexity.
5. Missing `const` correctness:
The code misses `const` correctness in some places, such as the `QHstsPolicy::host` function. It's better to add `const` where appropriate to ensure thread safety and prevent accidental modifications.
6. Unnecessary include:
The code includes `QUrl::ComponentFormattingOptions`, but it's not used anywhere. It's better to remove this include to reduce code clutter.
7. Missing error handling:
The code lacks error handling for some functions, such as `QHstsPolicy::setHost` and `QHstsPolicy::setExpiry`. It's better to add error handling to ensure that the code can handle invalid inputs gracefully.
8. Unnecessary `Q_DECL_NOTHROW` macro:
The code includes the `Q_DECL_NOTHROW` macro in some functions, but it's not necessary. The macro is only needed for functions that throw exceptions, and none of the functions in this code throw exceptions.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, addressing these minor issues can make the code more maintainable, readable, and secure.
