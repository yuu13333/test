 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses the Qt namespace, which is not recommended for new projects. Instead, it is recommended to use the Qt:: namespace, which provides better separation of concerns and avoids naming conflicts.

Additionally, the code uses the Q_GLOBAL_STATIC macro, which is not recommended for new projects. Instead, it is recommended to use the Q_DECLARE_METATYPE macro to register the metatype.

Finally, the code uses the QMutexLocker class, which is not recommended for new projects. Instead, it is recommended to use the std::lock_guard class to acquire locks.

Here's an example of how the code could be refactored to address these issues:
```cpp
#include <QInputDevice>
#include <QObject>
#include <QString>
#include <QVector>
#include <QMetaObject>
#include <QBasicMutex>
#include <QMutexLocker>
#include <std::lock_guard>

QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE

class QInputDevicePrivate {
public:
    QInputDevicePrivate(const QString &name, qint64 id, QInputDevice::DeviceType type, const QString &seatName, QObject *parent)
        : name(name), id(id), type(type), seatName(seatName), parent(parent) {}

    QString name;
    qint64 id;
    QInputDevice::DeviceType type;
    QString seatName;
    QObject *parent;
};

QInputDevice::QInputDevice(const QString &name, qint64 id, QInputDevice::DeviceType type, const QString &seatName, QObject *parent)
    : QObject(new QInputDevicePrivate(name, id, type, seatName, parent))
