 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for variable names and underscore for function names.
2. Type annotations and initialization:
Some variables are not initialized properly, and some type annotations are missing. For example, in the `WindowSupport` constructor, `m_shutdown` is not initialized. Also, `m_toggleFullScreenAction` is not initialized before it's used.
3. Function documentation:
Some functions lack documentation. It's a good practice to add a brief description of what the function does, its parameters, return value, and any other relevant information.
4. Code organization:
The code is quite long and complex. It may be beneficial to break it down into smaller functions or classes to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly. For example, if `ActionManager::registerAction` or `ICore::addContextObject` fails, the code doesn't handle the error appropriately. It's a good practice to check for errors and handle them appropriately, for example, by logging the error and continuing gracefully.
6. Unused variables and functions:
Some variables and functions are not used anywhere in the code. For example, `m_dockMenu` and `updateFullScreenAction` are not used. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and improve code readability.
7. Code style:
Some code style issues, such as inconsistent indentation and spacing, can make the code harder to read. It's a good practice to follow a consistent coding style throughout the code.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and I didn't find any significant security defects. However, following the best practices mentioned above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security.
