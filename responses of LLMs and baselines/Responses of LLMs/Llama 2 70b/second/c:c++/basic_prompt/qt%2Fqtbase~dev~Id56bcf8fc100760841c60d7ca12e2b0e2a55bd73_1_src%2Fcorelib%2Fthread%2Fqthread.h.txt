 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few things that could be improved:

1. The code uses C++11/C++14 features, but the version of the C++ standard is not specified. It is recommended to specify the version of the C++ standard to ensure compatibility and avoid potential issues.
2. The code uses the `Q_DECLARE_PRIVATE` macro, which is not a standard C++ feature. It is specific to the Qt library and is used to declare private members of a class. However, it would be better to use the standard C++ `private` keyword to declare private members, as it is more readable and maintainable.
3. The code uses the `Q_CORE_EXPORT` macro, which is not a standard C++ feature.
