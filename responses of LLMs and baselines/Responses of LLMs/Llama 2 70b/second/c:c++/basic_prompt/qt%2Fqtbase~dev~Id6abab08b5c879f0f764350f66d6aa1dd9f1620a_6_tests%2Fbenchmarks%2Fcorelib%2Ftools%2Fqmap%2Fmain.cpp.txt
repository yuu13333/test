 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are some potential issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Unused variables and functions: The code defines some unused variables and functions, such as "ucs4lloWorld" and "ctorStdMap". It's better to remove them to reduce code complexity.
3. Missing documentation: Some functions and classes lack documentation. It's important to add documentation to make the code more understandable and maintainable.
4. Use of "QBENCHMARK" macro: The code uses the "QBENCHMARK" macro to measure the performance of some functions. However, it's not clear what the benchmarks are measuring, and the results are not printed to the console. It's better to use a more descriptive name for the macro and print the results to the console for easier analysis.
5. Use of "QMap" instead of "std::map": The code uses "QMap" instead of "std::map" for some containers. While "QMap" provides some additional functionality, it's not always necessary, and using "std::map" can provide better performance. It's better to use "std::map" when possible and reserve "QMap" for cases where its additional functionality is necessary.
6. Unnecessary loops: Some functions, such as "insertion_int_intx" and "insertion_int_int2", have loops that are not necessary. It's better to remove them and use a more efficient approach.
7. Use of "toStdMap" function: The code uses the "toStdMap" function to convert a "QMap" to a "std::map". However, this function is not necessary, and it's better to use a "std::map" directly instead of converting between containers.
8. Use of "QString" instead of "const char*" : The code uses "QString" instead of "const char*" for some string literals. While "QString" provides some additional functionality, it's not always necessary, and using "const char*" can provide better performance.
