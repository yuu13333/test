 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Missing include guards:
The header file lacks include guards, which can lead to multiple inclusions of the same file and potential issues with circular dependencies. It's recommended to add include guards at the top of the file, for example:
```cpp
#ifndef MINIMAPSETTINGSPAGE_H
#define MINIMAPSETTINGSPAGE_H
```
2. Unused variables and functions:
The code contains a few unused variables and functions, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It's recommended to remove or comment out unused code to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
3. Missing const-correctness:
The member function `displaySettingsChanged` should be declared with the `const` keyword, as it doesn't modify the object. This will ensure that the function doesn't accidentally modify the object and will make the code more readable.
4. Missing documentation:
The code lacks documentation for the member functions and variables. Adding documentation will make the code easier to understand and will help other developers understand the purpose and usage of the code.
5. Non-standard spacing and indentation:
The code uses non-standard spacing and indentation, which can make the code harder to read and understand. It's recommended to follow a consistent coding style throughout the codebase to improve readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and secure. However, addressing the minor issues mentioned above will improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security.
