 No security defects are detected in the code.

The code appears to be well-structured and well-maintained, with clear and consistent naming conventions and commenting. It also uses modern C++ features such as constexpr and decltype to improve code readability and safety.

The code is organized into a single namespace, QAccessibleCache, which contains all the functions and variables related to the accessibility cache. The namespace is properly terminated, and all the functions and variables are properly scoped.

The code uses a combination of static and instance functions, depending on the needs of the functionality being implemented. The instance functions are properly constructed and destructed, and the static functions are properly initialized and cleaned up.

The code also uses smart pointers (unique_ptr) to automatically manage memory, which reduces the risk of memory leaks or undefined behavior due to manual memory management.

The code uses a variety of standard library containers, such as vectors and maps, to store and manipulate data. The containers are properly initialized and cleaned up, and the code uses appropriate iterators to access the data.

The code also includes debugging and logging statements to help diagnose issues and improve performance. The logging statements are properly formatted and include useful information for debugging purposes.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and well-maintained, and it does not contain any obvious security defects.
