 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For consistency, I suggest using camelCase for all variable and function names.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add documentation comments for classes, functions, and variables to provide context and make the code easier to understand.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code maintenance. For example, the "s_pathToLauncher" variable and the "launcherIsNotExecutable" function are not used anywhere in the code.
4. Complicated shutdown process:
The shutdown process of the launcher seems complicated, involving multiple threads, mutexes, and invocations. It may be worth considering simplifying the shutdown process to make it easier to understand and maintain.
5. Hardcoded paths:
The code hardcodes the path to the launcher executable. It's better to use a configurable path or a path that can be determined at runtime to make the code more flexible and portable.
6. Missing error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly in some places. For example, if the "start" method fails, it doesn't provide any error feedback to the user. It's better to handle errors appropriately and provide informative error messages to the user.
7. Unnecessary includes:
The code includes some unnecessary headers, such as "qtcassert.h", which doesn't seem to be used anywhere in the code. It's better to remove them to reduce code clutter.
8. Code organization:
The code organization could be improved. For example, the "LauncherInterfacePrivate" class is defined inside the "LauncherInterface" class, which makes the code harder to read and understand. It's better to define the private class separately and provide a forward declaration in the public class.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, and I don't detect any major security defects. However, following the suggestions above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security.
