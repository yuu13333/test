 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It is recommended to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code to improve readability.
2. Comments:
The code has minimal comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of the code, especially in the `JsonSummaryPage` class, would make it easier for others to understand the code and maintain it.
3. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are very short. It is recommended to use descriptive function names that clearly indicate their purpose, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
4. Variable naming:
Some variable names are descriptive, while others are not. For example, `m_wizard` and `m_fileList` are descriptive, while `generatedProject` and `files` are not. It is recommended to use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into different namespaces, but it would be beneficial to break the long code into smaller functions or classes to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Error handling:
The code has limited error handling. For example, in the `triggerCommit` function, an error message is displayed to the user, but the error is not propagated up the call stack. It is recommended to handle errors appropriately, either by propagating them up the call stack or by logging them.
7. Security:
The code does not appear to have any security vulnerabilities, but it is always a good practice to validate user input and avoid using raw user input in critical sections of the code.
