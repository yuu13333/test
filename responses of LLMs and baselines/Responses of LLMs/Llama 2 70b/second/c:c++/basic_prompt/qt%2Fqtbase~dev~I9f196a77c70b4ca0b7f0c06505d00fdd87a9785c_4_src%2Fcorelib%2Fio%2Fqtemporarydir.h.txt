 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. The code uses both GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 and GNU General Public License version 2.0/3.0. It would be better to clarify which license the code is using, as the two licenses have different requirements and implications.
2. The code includes the QtCore module, but it does not seem to use any Qt-specific functionality. It would be better to remove the inclusion of QtCore and use the standard C++ library instead.
3. The code uses a custom `QTemporaryDirPrivate` class, but it is not clear what this class does or why it is needed. It would be better to provide more documentation or comments to explain the purpose of this class.
4. The code uses `QScopedPointer` to manage memory, but it is not clear why this is necessary. It would be better to provide more documentation or comments to explain the reasoning behind using `QScopedPointer`.
5. The code uses `std::exchange` to transfer ownership of the `d_ptr` member variable, but it is not clear why this is necessary. It would be better to provide more documentation or comments to explain the reasoning behind using `std::exchange`.
6. The code uses `Q_DISABLE_COPY` to disable copying of the `QTemporaryDir` class, but it is not clear why this is necessary. It would be better to provide more documentation or comments to explain the reasoning behind using `Q_DISABLE_COPY`.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written and secure, but there are a few minor issues that could be improved to make the code more maintainable and understandable.
