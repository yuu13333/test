 After analyzing the generated files, I did not find any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code is quite clean and well-structured, and it's good to see that the developer has followed best practices for coding, such as using const correctness, inline comments, and appropriate naming conventions.

The only suggestion I would like to make is to consider using a more secure way of loading the configuration file. Currently, the code uses the `QSettings` class to load the configuration file, which can be vulnerable to attacks such as DNS spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks.

To mitigate this risk, you could consider using a more secure method such as loading the configuration file from a trusted source, such as a secure HTTPS connection, or by using a secure configuration file format, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Overall, the code looks well-written, and I commend the developer for their attention to detail and adherence to best practices.

Solution: Consider using a more secure method for loading the configuration file, such as a trusted HTTPS connection or a secure configuration file format like JWT.
