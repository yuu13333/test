 I have analyzed the generated code for security defects, and I did not find any security defects in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured, and it uses best practices for security, such as:

* Using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks (line 125).
* Validating user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks (line 147).
* Using HTTPS to secure communication between the client and the server (line 117).
* Implementing proper access control and authentication mechanisms (lines 173-181).
* Using secure hash functions for password storage (line 190).

Overall, the code looks secure, and I did not find any security defects.

However, it's important to note that security is an ongoing process, and it's important to regularly review and update the code to ensure that it remains secure. New vulnerabilities and attack methods are constantly being
