 Based on the generated files, I have analyzed the original code for security defects. Here are my findings:

1. Insecure Practices:

The code uses the `QDateTime::currentDateTime()` function to generate a timestamp for the user's session. However, this function can be vulnerable to timestamp manipulation attacks, which can allow an attacker to bypass session expiration mechanisms.

Line Number: 158

Solution: Use a secure timestamp generation mechanism, such as using the `QDateTime::fromTime_t()` function with a secure time source, like the system clock or a trusted NTP server.

2. SQL Injection:

The code uses raw SQL queries to interact with the database, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious SQL code to extract sensitive data or modify the database.

Line Number: 205

Solution: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
