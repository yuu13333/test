 After analyzing the generated files, I did not detect any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the codebase is relatively small, and the functionality is limited to managing windows and actions. Therefore, the potential for security vulnerabilities is lower compared to more complex software systems.

That being said, it's always important to keep security in mind when developing software, and to follow best practices to prevent common security vulnerabilities, such as:

* Input validation: Ensuring that user input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other attacks.
* Password storage: Storing passwords securely, using techniques such as bcrypt, argon2, or PBKDF2, to protect against password cracking attacks.
* Access control: Implementing
