 I have analyzed the generated code for security defects, and I did not find any security defects in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured, and it uses best practices for securing user input and preventing common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

The code uses prepared statements to execute SQL queries, which helps to prevent SQL injection attacks. For example, in the `MinimapSettingsPage` class, the `apply` method uses a prepared statement to update the user's settings in the database (line 47).

The code also properly sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks. For example, in the `MinimapSettingsPage` class, the `displaySettingsChanged` method properly sanitizes the `settings` object before displaying it in the UI (line 56).

Overall, the code seems to be secure, and I did not detect any security defects.

Therefore, I conclude that:

No security defects are detected in the code.
