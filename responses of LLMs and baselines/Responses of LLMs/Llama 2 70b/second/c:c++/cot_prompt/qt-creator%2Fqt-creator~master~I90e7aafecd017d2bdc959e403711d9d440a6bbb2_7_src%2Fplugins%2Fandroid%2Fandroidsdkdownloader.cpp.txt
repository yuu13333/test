 After analyzing the generated code, I did not detect any security defects.

However, I would like to mention that the code uses the `QDir` class to iterate over the files in the SDK directory, which could potentially lead to a directory traversal vulnerability if the SDK directory is not properly sanitized.

Line number: 111

Solution:
To mitigate this risk, the code should validate that the SDK directory is properly formatted and does not contain any ..\ or .. components. Additionally, the code should use the `QDir::root()` method to ensure that the directory is properly rooted.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to address this issue:
```c++
QDir sdkDir(QStandardPaths::writableLocation(QStandardPaths::DownloadLocation));
sdkDir.setFilter(QDir::Files | QDir::NoDotAndDotDot);
sdkDir.setSorting(QDir::Name | QDir::IgnoreCase);

QFileInfoList files = sdkDir.entryInfoList();
```
By setting the filter to `QDir::Files | QDir::NoDotAndDotDot`, the code ensures that only files (and not directories) are iterated over, and that the `.` and `..` directories are ignored. Additionally, by setting the sorting to `QDir::Name | QDir::IgnoreCase`, the code ensures that the files are sorted alphabetically, which can help prevent directory traversal attacks.

Overall, while no security defects were detected in the code, it's important to keep in mind potential security risks and take appropriate measures to mitigate them.
