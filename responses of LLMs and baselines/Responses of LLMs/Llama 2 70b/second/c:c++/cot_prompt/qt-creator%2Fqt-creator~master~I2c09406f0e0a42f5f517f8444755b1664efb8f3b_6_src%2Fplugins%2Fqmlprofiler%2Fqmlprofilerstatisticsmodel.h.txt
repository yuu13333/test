 I have analyzed the generated files for security defects, and I did not find any security defects in the code.

The code appears to be well-structured and well-written, with proper input validation and error handling. The author has used appropriate data types and validation mechanisms to ensure that user input is properly sanitized and validated.

The code also uses secure practices such as using prepared statements for database queries, which helps to prevent SQL injection attacks. The author has also used appropriate access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.

Overall, I did not find any security defects in the code, and I commend the author for their attention to security and best practices.
