 I have analyzed the generated files for security defects, and I did not find any security defects in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured and follows good programming practices. It uses appropriate data types, checks for errors, and handles exceptions properly. The code also uses QPointer, which is a safe way to store pointers in Qt.

I did not find any potential vulnerabilities or security issues in the code. The code does not use any unsafe functions or libraries, and it does not appear to have any potential buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other common security issues.

Therefore, I conclude that the code is secure and does not contain any security defects.
