 After analyzing the generated files, I did not find any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code uses the `QSharedPointer` class to manage the lifetime of objects, which is a good practice for avoiding memory leaks and bugs. Additionally, the code uses const correctness to ensure that objects are not modified unnecessarily, which is a good practice for maintaining code integrity and preventing unintended side effects.

The code also uses the `QComboBox` and `QSpinBox` classes to implement user input validation, which is a good practice for ensuring that user input is properly sanitized and validated.

Overall, the code seems to follow good coding practices and does not contain any obvious security defects.

Therefore, I conclude that:

No security defects are detected in the code.
