 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out some minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some member variables start with an uppercase letter (e.g., "m_name"), while others start with a lowercase letter (e.g., "m_checkedValue"). It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Use of "override" keyword:
In some places, the "override" keyword is missing, which can lead to confusion when a method with the same name and signature is defined in a base class. For example, in the "PathChooserField" class, the "setup" method does not have the "override" keyword, even though it overrides the same method in the "Field" class.
3. Use of "const" correctness:
In some places, the "const" keyword is not used correctly. For example, in the "PathChooserField" class, the "m_path" member variable is not declared as "const", even though it does not change after construction. It's better to declare it as "const" to ensure that it does not get modified accidentally.
4. Use of "QVariant" instead of "QString":
In some places, "QVariant" is used instead of "QString" for storing string data. While this is not wrong, it's better to use "QString" for string data to avoid confusion and make the code more readable.
5. Missing "Q_DECLARE_PRIVATE" macro:
The "Q_DECLARE_PRIVATE" macro is missing in some places, which can lead to issues with the declaration of private members. It's better to use this macro to ensure that private members are properly declared and hidden from the outside world.
6. Unused variables and methods:
There are some unused variables and methods in the code, such as "m_factor" in the "SpacerField" class and the "parseData" method in the "LabelField" class. It's better to remove these unused elements to make the code more concise and easier to maintain.
7. Missing documentation:
Some classes and methods lack documentation, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand the code and its purpose. It's better to add documentation comments to the code to make it more readable and maintainable.
8. Use of "std::unique_ptr" instead of "QSharedPointer":
In the "ComboBoxField" class, "std::unique_ptr" is used instead of "QSharedPointer". While this is not wrong, it's better to use "QSharedPointer" to ensure that the memory management is handled correctly and to avoid issues with thread safety.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, there are a few minor issues that can be improved to make the code more consistent, readable, and maintainable.
