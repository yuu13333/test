 I have reviewed the code and found a few potential security defects. Here are my findings:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
In the `EmrunRunConfiguration` class, the `updateConfiguration` function is called twice: once in the constructor and once in the `WebBrowserSelectionAspect` changed signal handler. The second call to `updateConfiguration` is not necessary and can be removed.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
The `EmrunRunWorker` class uses a `PortsGatherer` instance to gather the ports used by the emrun command. However, the `PortsGatherer` instance is not properly cleaned up when the `EmrunRunWorker` is destroyed. This can lead to a resource leak.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
The `EmrunRunWorker` class uses a `CommandLine` instance to represent the emrun command. However, the `CommandLine` instance is not properly cleaned up when the `EmrunRunWorker` is destroyed. This can lead to a resource leak.
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
In the `emrunCommand` function, the `html` parameter is constructed by appending the project display name to the build directory path. However, this can lead to a path traversal vulnerability if the project display name contains directory separators.
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
The `EmrunRunWorker` class does not properly handle errors when starting the emrun command. If the emrun command fails to start, the `start` function will crash.
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
The `EmrunRunWorker` class does not properly check the exit code of the emrun command. If the emrun command fails, the `start` function will crash.
7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
In the `EmrunRunConfiguration` class, the `effectiveEmrunCall` aspect is compared to the `emrunCommand` function using `==`. However, this comparison is incorrect because the `emrunCommand` function returns a new `CommandLine` instance every time it is called.
8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
The `EmrunRunWorker` class does not properly handle exceptions when starting the emrun command. If an exception is thrown, the `start` function will crash.
9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
The `EmrunRunWorker` class does not properly neutralize user input when constructing the emrun command. This can lead to a command injection vulnerability.
10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
The code does not adhere to the coding standards for brace placement, indentation, and naming conventions.

To fix these defects, I recommend the following changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary call to `updateConfiguration` in the `EmrunRunConfiguration` constructor.
2. Properly clean up the `PortsGatherer` instance in the `EmrunRunWorker` destructor.
3. Properly clean up the `CommandLine` instance in the `EmrunRunWorker` destructor.
4. Use a safer method to construct the `html` parameter, such as using a `QDir` instance to append the project display name to the build directory path.
5. Handle errors when starting the emrun command and provide a meaningful error message.
6. Check the exit code of the emrun command and provide a meaningful error message if the command fails.
7. Use a safer method to compare the `effectiveEmrunCall` aspect to the `emrunCommand` function, such as using a `QString` comparison.
8. Handle exceptions when starting the emrun command and provide a meaningful error message.
9. Neutralize user input when constructing the emrun command using a `QString` instance.
10. Follow coding standards for brace placement, indentation, and naming conventions.
