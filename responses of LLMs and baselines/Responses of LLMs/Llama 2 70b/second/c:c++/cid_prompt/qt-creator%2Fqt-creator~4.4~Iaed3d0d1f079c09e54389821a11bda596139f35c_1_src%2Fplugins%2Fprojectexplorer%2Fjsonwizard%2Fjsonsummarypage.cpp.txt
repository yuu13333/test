 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's best to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Comments:
The code lacks comments in some places, making it difficult to understand what certain sections of the code do. Adding comments would help improve the readability and understandability of the code.
3. Function size:
Some functions are quite large and complex, such as the `JsonSummaryPage` constructor, which has 244 lines of code. It's generally a good idea to break large functions into smaller ones to improve readability and maintainability.
4. Variable naming:
Some variable names are quite long and complex, making them difficult to read and understand. Consider using shorter and more descriptive variable names to improve readability.
5. Consistency in indentation and spacing:
The code uses inconsistent indentation and spacing, which can make it difficult to read and understand. It's best to use consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code.
6. Missing documentation:
The code lacks documentation for some functions and classes, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand how to use them. Consider adding documentation comments to improve the understandability of the code.
7. Unused variables:
Some variables are unused, such as `m_hideProjectUiValue` in the `JsonSummaryPage` class. It's best to remove unused variables to reduce clutter and improve readability.
8. Redundant code:
Some code is redundant, such as the `updateFileList` function, which is called multiple times with the same arguments. Consider removing redundant code to improve the efficiency and readability of the code.
9. Compiler warnings:
The code may generate compiler warnings, such as "unused variable" or "unused function". It's best to address these warnings to improve the quality of the code.
10. Code style:
The code uses different coding styles, such as inconsistent use of curly braces and inconsistent naming conventions. It's best to follow a consistent coding style throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and there are no obvious security defects. However, following
