 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It would be helpful to add comments and documentation to the functions, classes, and variables to make the code more readable and understandable.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions, such as "m_extraCompilersFutureWatchers" and "checkForExtraCompilersFinished()". It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and make the code more maintainable.
4. Compiler warnings:
The code may generate compiler warnings, such as "unused variable" or "unused function". It's better to address these warnings and fix them to ensure that the code is error-free.
5. Error handling:
The code has limited error handling. It's better to add more error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected errors and exceptions gracefully.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to maintain and read. It's better to break the code into smaller files and modules to make it more manageable.
7. Use of QPointer:
The code uses QPointer, which can be a source of memory leaks. It's better to use smart pointers or unique_ptr instead to avoid memory leaks.
8. Use of QFuture:
The code uses QFuture, which can be a source of race conditions. It's better to use std::future or QFuture<T> instead to avoid race conditions.
9. Use of QMetaObject:
The code uses QMetaObject, which can be a source of performance issues. It's better to avoid using QMetaObject and instead use the Qt meta-object system.
10. Use of deprecated APIs:
The code uses some deprecated APIs, such as QFutureWatcher<ProjectInfo>::finished. It's better to use the recommended APIs instead to ensure that the code is future-proof.
