 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses some legacy Qt APIs that are deprecated and will be removed in future versions of Qt. For example, the use of `Q_GLOBAL_STATIC` and `QBasicMutex` is discouraged in favor of `QMutex` and `QMutexLocker`. Also, the use of `QInputDevicePrivate` is not necessary, and the code can be simplified by using the `QInputDevice` class directly.

Additionally, the code uses a `QVector` to store a list of `QInputDevice` pointers, but it is not necessary to use a vector for this purpose. A `QList` would be sufficient, and it would be easier to read and maintain.

Here's an example of how the code could be simplified:
```c++
#include <QInputDevice>
#include <QMutex>
#include <QMutexLocker>

QInputDevice::QInputDevice(const QString &name, qint64 id, QInput
