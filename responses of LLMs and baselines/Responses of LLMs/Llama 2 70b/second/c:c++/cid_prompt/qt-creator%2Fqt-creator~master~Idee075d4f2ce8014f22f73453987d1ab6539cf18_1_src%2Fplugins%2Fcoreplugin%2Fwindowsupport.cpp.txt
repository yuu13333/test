 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For consistency, I recommend using camelCase for variable and function names, as it is the conventional naming style for Qt.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add documentation to classes, functions, and variables to make the code readable and understandable. Consider using Doxygen or another documentation tool to add comments and generate documentation.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions, such as `m_toggleFullScreenAction` and `updateFullScreenAction()`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code maintenance.
4. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple namespaces, but some functions and variables are not properly nested. Consider reorganizing the code to improve its structure and readability. For example, move the `WindowList` functions and variables inside the `Internal` namespace.
5. Minor issues:
There are some minor issues, such as missing `const` correctness, unnecessary `QObject::connect` calls, and redundant `QTC_ASSERT` statements. It's recommended to address these issues to improve code quality.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and secure. However, following the suggestions above will make the code more maintainable, readable, and consistent with Qt's coding standards.
