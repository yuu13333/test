 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing documentation:
The code lacks proper documentation. It's essential to add comments and documentation to the code to make it easier for others to understand and maintain.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and make the code more maintainable.
4. Complicated shutdown process:
The shutdown process of the shell process is a bit complicated. It might be better to simplify it by using a single method that takes care of all the necessary steps.
5. Hardcoded shell command:
The code hardcodes the shell command as "bash". It might be better to make it a configurable option to allow for different shells to be used.
6. Missing error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly. It's better to add proper error handling to ensure that the code can recover grace
