 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as "ucs4lloWorld," are difficult to understand. It's better to use descriptive variable names that clearly convey their purpose.
3. Function documentation:
Some functions, such as "insertion_int_intx," lack documentation. It's helpful to add a brief description of the function's purpose and parameters to aid in understanding the code.
4. Code organization:
The code has many functions that are not necessarily related to each other. It's better to group related functions together in a separate class or module to improve code organization and reduce the risk of conflicts.
5. Error handling:
The code does not handle errors properly. For example, in the "insertion_int_int" function, if the map.insert() function fails, it will not be handled properly. It's better to add error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, to handle such situations.
6. Benchmarking:
The code uses QBENCHMARK to measure the performance of various functions. However, it's not clear how the
