 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses a mix of both Qt and C++ standard library containers, which may not be the most efficient or effective way to write the code. It would be better to stick to one container library throughout the code to avoid any potential issues that may arise from mixing different libraries.

Additionally, some of the benchmark functions, such as `insertion_int_intx()` and `insertion_int_int2()`, seem to be duplicated with minor variations. It would be better to merge these functions into a single function and use a parameter to control the variation. This would make the code more concise and easier to maintain.

Finally, the `ctorStdMap()` function is not actually testing anything, but instead, it is just creating an empty map and then immediately destructing it. This function can be removed entirely, as it is not providing any valuable information or testing any specific functionality.
