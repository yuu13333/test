 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code is quite old (it's using Qt 5.2, which is from 2012) and it's missing some includes that are usually included in modern Qt code (e.g. `QObject` and `QMetaObject`).

Additionally, the code is using some deprecated APIs (e.g. `QAbstractEventDispatcher::processEvents()`) and some APIs that are not recommended to use (e.g. `QCoreApplication::sendSpontaneousEvent()`).

It's also worth mentioning that the code is missing some necessary includes for some of the functions it's using (e.g. `QString::fromUtf8()`).

It's also worth noting that the code is using `QPrivateSignal` which is not a public API and it's not recommended to use it.

It's recommended to update the code to a more modern version of Qt and to follow the best practices for Qt development.
