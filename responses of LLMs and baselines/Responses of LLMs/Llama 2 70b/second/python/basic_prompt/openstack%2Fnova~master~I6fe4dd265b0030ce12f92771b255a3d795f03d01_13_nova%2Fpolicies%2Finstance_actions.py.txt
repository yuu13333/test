 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The docstrings in the code are not consistent. Some docstrings are written in sentence case, while others are in title case. It's better to use sentence case for docstrings, as it's more readable.
3. Line breaks:
Some lines are very long and could be broken up into shorter lines for better readability. For example, the last line of the code, `return instance_actions_policies`, could be moved to a new line for better readability.
4. Indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines have four spaces of indentation, while others have eight. It's better to use four spaces of indentation consistently throughout the code.
5. Comments:
The code has very few comments. It's a good practice to add comments to explain the purpose of the code, especially for complex logic. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
6. Function naming:
The function `list_rules()` is not very descriptive. It's better to use a more descriptive name that indicates what the function does, such as `get_instance_action_policies()`.
7. Variable naming:
The variable `DEPRECATED_INSTANCE_ACTION_POLICY` is not very descriptive. It's better to use a more descriptive name that indicates what the variable represents, such as `deprecated_instance_action_policy`.
8. Constant naming:
The constant `BASE_POLICY_NAME` is not very descriptive. It's better to use a more descriptive name that indicates what the constant represents, such as `BASE_INSTANCE_ACTION_POLICY_NAME`.

Overall, the code is well-structured and easy to read. With a few improvements in naming conventions, docstrings, line breaks, indentation, comments, function naming, variable naming, and constant naming, the code can be even better.
