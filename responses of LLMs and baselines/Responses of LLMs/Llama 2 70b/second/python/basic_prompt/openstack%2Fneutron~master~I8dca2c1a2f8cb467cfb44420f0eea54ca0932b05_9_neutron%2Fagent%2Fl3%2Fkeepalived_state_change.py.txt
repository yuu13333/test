 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. Adding docstrings can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports some modules that are not used, such as `httplib2` and `six.moves`. It's better to remove unused imports to reduce clutter and minimize the risk of unintended dependencies.
4. Unnecessary blank lines:
There are several blank lines in the code that can be removed to make it more concise.
5. Use of `os.path.join()`:
Instead of using `os.path.join()` to concatenate path components, consider using the `pathlib` module, which provides a more Pythonic way of working with paths.
6. Use of `open()` instead of `with`:
In some places, the code uses `open()` to open a file without closing it properly. It's better to use a `with` statement to ensure that the file is properly closed, even if an exception is raised.
7. Missing error handling:
In some places, the code does not handle errors properly. For example, in the `send_garp()` function, there is no error handling for the `ip_lib.send_ip_addr_adv_notif()` call. If an error occurs, the function will raise an exception without proper error handling.
8. Use of `log_exception=False`:
In some places, the code sets `log_exception=False` when calling `ip_lib.send_ip_addr_adv_notif()`. This can suppress error messages that could be useful for debugging purposes. Instead, consider logging the exception and continuing to execute the rest of the code.
9. Use of `privileged.default.set_client_mode(False)`:
The code sets `privileged.default.set_client_mode(False)` without proper explanation or justification. If this line is necessary, consider adding a comment to explain its purpose.

Overall, the code seems well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, addressing these minor issues can improve its readability, maintainability, and security.
