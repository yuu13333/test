 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent indentation: The indentation in the code is inconsistent, with some lines having 4 spaces and others having 8 spaces. It is recommended to use a consistent indentation of 4 spaces throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings: Some functions and variables lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It is recommended to add docstrings for the following:
	* `_get_config_files` function
	* `_setup_service` function
	* `error_application` function
	* `init_application` function
	* `service_ref` variable
3. Unused variables: The `service_ref` variable is assigned but never used. It is recommended to remove the unused variable.
4. Unnecessary imports: The `oslo_config` and `oslo_log` modules are imported, but their functions are not used in the code. It is recommended to remove the unnecessary imports.
5. Missing `os.path.join` argument: In the `deploy.loadapp` function call, the `config` argument is not properly joined with the `name` argument. It is recommended to use `os.path.join` to concatenate the two arguments.
6. Unnecessary `try`-`except` block: The `try`-`except` block around the `_setup_service` function call is not necessary, as the function does not raise any exceptions. It is recommended to remove the unnecessary block.
7. Unused `logging.setup` function: The `logging.setup` function is called, but its result is not used. It is recommended to remove the unused function call.
8. Unused `service.setup_profiler` function: The `service.setup_profiler` function is called, but its result is not used. It is recommended to remove the unused function call.
9. Unnecessary `conf_files` list: The `conf_files` list is created but only the first element is used. It is recommended to remove the unnecessary list and use the first element directly.

With these minor issues and suggestions addressed, the code would look like this:
