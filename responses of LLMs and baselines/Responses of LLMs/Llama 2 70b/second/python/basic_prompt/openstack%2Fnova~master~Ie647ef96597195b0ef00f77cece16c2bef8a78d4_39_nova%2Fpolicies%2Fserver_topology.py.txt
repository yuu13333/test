 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for the functions and classes. Docstrings help in understanding the purpose and parameters of a function or class, making the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Type hints:
The code doesn't use type hints for function parameters and return types. Type hints can help in catching type-related errors at runtime and make the code more readable.
4. Default values:
The `list_rules()` function doesn't have a default value for the `server_id` parameter. It's better to provide a default value or validate the input to avoid potential errors.
5. Path traversal:
The code uses a hardcoded path `/servers/{server_id}/topology` in the `policy.DocumentedRuleDefault` definitions. It's better to use a variable or a configuration setting for the path to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
6. Missing permissions:
The code doesn't check for the necessary permissions for the `list_rules()` function. It's better to add a permission check to ensure that only authorized users can access the function.
7. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors properly. It's better to add try-except blocks to handle errors and provide meaningful error messages to the user.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and the policies are defined correctly. However, following best practices and addressing the above-mentioned points can make the code more maintainable, readable, and secure.
