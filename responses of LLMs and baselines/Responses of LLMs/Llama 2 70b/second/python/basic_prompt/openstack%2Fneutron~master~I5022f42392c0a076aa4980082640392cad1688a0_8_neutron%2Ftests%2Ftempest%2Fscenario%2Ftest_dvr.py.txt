 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's a good practice to use type hints and annotations for all function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will help catch type-related errors at runtime and make the code more readable.
3. Docstrings:
The code has docstrings for some functions, but not for all. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions, even if they are trivial. This will help provide context and make the code more understandable.
4. Function signature:
The function `check_connectivity_snat_down` has a long signature with many arguments. It's a good practice to break down long functions into smaller functions each with a single responsibility. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Constant naming:
The code uses constants that are not explicitly defined. It's a good practice to define constants explicitly, even if they are used only once. This will make the code more readable and avoid magic numbers.
6. Exception handling:
The code does not handle exceptions properly. It's a good practice to handle exceptions appropriately, especially when dealing with network operations. This will help prevent the code from crashing unexpectedly and provide better error messages.
7. Test organization:
The code has multiple test cases in a single class. It's a good practice to have a separate class for each test case. This will make the code more organized and easier to maintain.
8. Test naming:
The code uses inconsistent naming conventions for test methods. It's a good practice to use descriptive names for test methods that indicate the test purpose and scope. This will make the code more readable and help identify the test purpose quickly.
