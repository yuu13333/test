 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent coding style:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses Python 2.7, which doesn't have built-in type hints and annotations. However, it's a good practice to add type hints and annotations to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. docstrings:
The code has very few docstrings. It's a good practice to add docstrings to functions, classes, and methods to provide a brief description of what they do and what their purpose is.
4. Function naming:
Some of the function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are very short. It's a good practice to use descriptive and meaningful function names that clearly convey what the function does.
5. Variable naming:
Some of the variable names are quite long and descriptive, while others are very short. It's a good practice to use descriptive and meaningful variable names that clearly convey what the variable represents.
6. Consistent indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's a good practice to use consistent indentation throughout the code.
7. Comments:
The code has very few comments. It's a good practice to add comments to explain the purpose of the code, especially in complex sections.
8. Testing:
The code has a test case, but it's not exhaustive. It's a good practice to add more test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to read. However, following the best practices mentioned above can make the code more maintainable, readable, and secure.
