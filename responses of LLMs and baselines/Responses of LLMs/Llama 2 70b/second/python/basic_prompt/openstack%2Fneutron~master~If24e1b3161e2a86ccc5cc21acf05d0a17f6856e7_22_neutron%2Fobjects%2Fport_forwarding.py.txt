 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's maintainability and readability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it can make the code harder to read and understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future. It's generally a good idea to stick to a single naming convention throughout the codebase.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the functions and classes in the code do not have docstrings. Docstrings are important for providing context and explanations of the code's purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can help other developers understand the code more easily and reduce the risk of misunderstandings or incorrect usage.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports the `itertools` module, but it does not seem to be used anywhere. Unused imports can make the code harder to read and may introduce unnecessary dependencies. It's a good idea to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
4. Unnecessary complexity:
The `modify_fields_from_db` and `modify_fields_to_db` methods seem to be overly complex, with multiple nested if-else statements and manual manipulation of attribute names. This complexity can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It may be worth considering simplifying these methods or refactoring them to use a more straightforward approach.

Overall, while there are no direct security defects in the code, addressing these minor issues can help improve the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality.
