 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the variables and functions lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all public variables and functions.
3. Unused variables:
The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `UPDATED_TIMESTAMP` and `REQUIRED_EXTENSIONS`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and reduce code clutter.
4. Unnecessary comments:
Some comments are not necessary and can be removed, such as the comment on line 11 that simply states the License under which the code is licensed.
5. Missing whitespace:
The code lacks whitespace in some places, such as between the `SUB_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP` and `ACTION_MAP` definitions. Adding whitespace can make the code more readable.
6. Redundant keys in dictionaries:
The `RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP`, `SUB_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP`, `ACTION_MAP`, and `ACTION_STATUS` dictionaries all have empty keys, which can be removed.
7. Unnecessary blank lines:
There are some unnecessary blank lines in the code, such as between the `SUB_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP` and `ACTION_MAP` definitions. Removing them can make the code more concise.

Here's an example of how the code could be improved:

# Whether or not this extension is simply signaling behavior to the user
# or it actively modifies the attribute map.
IS_SHIM_EXTENSION = True

# Whether the extension is marking the adoption of standardattr model for

# The name of the extension.

# The description of the extension.
DESCRIPTION = "Provides secuirty groups filtering when listing ports"

# A timestamp of when the extension was introduced.
INTRODUCTION_TIMESTAMP = '2018-01-09T09:00:00-00:00'

# The resource attribute map for the extension.
RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP = {}

# The subresource attribute map for the extension.
SUB_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP = {}

# The action map.

# The action status.
ACTION_STATUS = {}

# The list of required extensions.

# The list of optional extensions.
OPTIONAL_EXTENSIONS = []
```
This code is more concise and easier to read, with improved naming conventions and removed unnecessary comments and variables.
