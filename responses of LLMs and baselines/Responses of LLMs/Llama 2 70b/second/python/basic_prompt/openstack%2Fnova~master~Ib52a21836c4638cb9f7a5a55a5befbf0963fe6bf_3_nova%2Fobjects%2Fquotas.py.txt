 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few observations that could be improved:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
3. Docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and any exceptions they may raise. Adding docstrings can help developers understand the code without having to read through the implementation.
4. Function signature:
The `ids_from_instance` function has a complex signature with multiple optional parameters. It may be worth considering breaking this function into smaller functions with simpler signatures, making it easier to understand and test.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple classes and functions, but some functions seem to be duplicates or have similar functionality. For example, the `ids_from_instance` and `ids_from_security_group` functions have similar implementation. It may be worth considering merging these functions or reorganizing the code to reduce duplication.
6. Comments:
Some parts of the code have comments that are not clear or outdated. For example, the `create_limit` and `update_limit` functions have comments that suggest they are not well-suited for the current quota system. It may be worth considering updating these comments or removing them if they are no longer relevant.
7. Test coverage:
The code has limited test coverage, with only a few test cases for the `Quotas` class. Adding more test cases can help ensure the code functions correctly and catch any defects or bugs.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, there are opportunities for improvement in terms of code organization, readability, and maintainability.
