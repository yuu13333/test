 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that may improve the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent indentation: The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines have 4 spaces, while others have 8 or 12. It's better to choose a consistent indentation size (e.g., 4 spaces) and stick to it throughout the code.
2. Line length: Some lines are quite long (e.g., line 41), which can make the code harder to read. It's a good practice to limit line length to 79 characters or less.
3. Variable naming: Some variable names are quite long and complex (e.g., `self.useFixture(nova_fixtures.NeutronFixture(self))`). It's better to use shorter and more descriptive variable names to make the code easier to read.
4. Comments: The code has very few comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of the code and the fixtures used can make the code easier to understand and maintain.
5. fixtures: The code uses both `nova_fixtures` and `nova.tests.unit.image.fake` fixtures. It's better to use a single fixture for all the tests in the class, rather than mixing them.
6. Method naming: The method naming is not very descriptive (e.g., `test_local_delete_removes_allocations`). It's better to use more descriptive method names that indicate the purpose of the test.
7. Test case organization: The test case is not organized in a logical way. It's better to group related test cases together and separate them with descriptive headings.
8. Missing docstring: The test class is missing a docstring that describes the purpose of the class and its methods. It's a good practice to add a docstring to the test class and its methods.

These are minor issues, and the code overall looks well-structured and easy to understand.
