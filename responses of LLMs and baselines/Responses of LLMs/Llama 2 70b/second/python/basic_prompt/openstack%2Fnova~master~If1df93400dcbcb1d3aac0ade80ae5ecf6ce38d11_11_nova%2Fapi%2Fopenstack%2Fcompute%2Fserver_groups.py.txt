 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are a few observations that could be improved or optimized:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
3. docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. Adding docstrings can help developers understand the code better and make it easier to maintain.
4. Consistency in exception handling:
The code uses a mix of try-except blocks and try-except-finally blocks. It's better to stick to a single approach for consistency and readability.
5. Consistency in quota check:
The code has multiple quota check logic scattered throughout the code. It's better to extract the quota check logic into a separate function and call it consistently wherever necessary.
6. Use of 'context' variable:
The code uses a 'context' variable that is not explicitly defined. It's better to define the context variable explicitly and provide type hints to avoid confusion.
7. Use of 'nova' module:
The code imports the 'nova' module but doesn't use it explicitly. It's better to remove the unused import statement to avoid confusion.
8. Use of 'objects' module:
The code imports the 'objects' module, but some of the objects are not used. It's better to remove the unused import statements to avoid confusion.
9. Use of 'local_limit' variable:
The code uses a 'local_limit' variable that is not explicitly defined. It's better to define the variable explicitly and provide type hints to avoid confusion.
10. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple modules, but some functions and classes are not properly organized. It's better to organize the code into separate modules and classes for better readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and security defects are detected. However, following best practices and optimizing the code can make it more maintainable and readable.
