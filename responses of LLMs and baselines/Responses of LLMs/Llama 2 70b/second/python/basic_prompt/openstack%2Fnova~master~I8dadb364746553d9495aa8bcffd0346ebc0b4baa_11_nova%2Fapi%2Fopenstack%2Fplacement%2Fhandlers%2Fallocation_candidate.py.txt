 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Error handling:
The code catches `jsonschema.ValidationError` and raises a `HTTPBadRequest` with a generic message that doesn't provide any details about the error. It's better to provide more specific error messages and handle errors appropriately, especially when it comes to validation errors.
3. Input validation:
The code uses `jsonschema.validate()` to validate the query string parameters, but it's not enough to just validate the schema. It's also important to validate the input data types, ranges, and formats. For example, the `resources` parameter should be a list of strings, and each string should match a specific pattern (e.g., `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`).
4. Security:
The code uses `util.normalize_resources_qs_param()` to normalize the `resources` parameter, but it's not clear what this function does or whether it's sufficient to prevent security vulnerabilities. It's recommended to review this function and ensure that it properly sanitizes and validates the input data.
5. Code organization:
The code is quite long and complex, with many nested functions and logic. It's better to break the code into smaller, more manageable functions, and use descriptive variable names and function descriptions to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Comments:
The code has minimal comments, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and logic of the code. It's recommended to add more comments to explain the code and make it easier for others to understand and maintain.
7. Testing:
The code doesn't seem to have any tests, which is a security risk in itself. It's important to write unit tests and integration tests to ensure that the code works as expected and to catch any bugs or security vulnerabilities early on.

Overall, while the code appears to be secure, there are some areas where it can be improved for better readability, maintainability, and security.
