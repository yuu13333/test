 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not annotated with type hints. Adding type hints can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for the functions and classes. Docstrings can provide a brief description of the function or class, making it easier for others to understand the code.
4. Error handling:
The code raises a generic "RFBAuthHandshakeFailed" exception for all errors. It's better to define specific exception classes for different error scenarios, making it easier to handle errors appropriately.
5. SSL/TLS configuration:
The code uses the `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` constant to specify the SSL/TLS version. However, it's better to use the `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS` constant and let the SSL/TLS library negotiate the highest supported version.
6. Certificate validation:
The code doesn't validate the server's certificate. It's recommended to validate the certificate to ensure the connection is secure.
7. Logging:
The code logs sensitive information such as the server's certificate and private key. It's better to avoid logging sensitive information and instead log only the necessary information for troubleshooting purposes.
