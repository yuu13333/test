 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, the code quality could be improved in several ways:

1. Consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations: The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's better to add type hints and annotations for all function parameters, return types, and variable declarations to improve code readability and maintainability.
3. Docstrings: The code lacks docstrings for most functions and classes. Docstrings help provide context and information about the purpose and usage of the code, making it easier for others to understand and maintain.
4. Function signature: The `test_parallel_evacuate_with_server_group` function has a complex signature with many arguments. It's better to break down the function into smaller functions each with a single responsibility, making the code easier to read and maintain.
5. Code organization: The code is organized into a single file, making it difficult to locate specific functions or classes. It's better to break down the code into smaller modules or classes, each with its own responsibilities, to improve code organization and maintainability.
6. Comments: The code lacks clear and concise comments that explain the purpose and usage of the code. Add comments to help others understand the code and its intent.
7. Error handling: The code doesn't handle errors and exceptions properly. It's better to add try-except blocks and handle errors and exceptions appropriately, to prevent the code from crashing or producing unexpected behavior.
8. Code style: The code uses inconsistent indentation and spacing. It's better to follow a consistent coding style throughout the code to improve readability.

Overall, while the code appears to be functional, it could benefit from improvements in code quality, organization, and readability.
