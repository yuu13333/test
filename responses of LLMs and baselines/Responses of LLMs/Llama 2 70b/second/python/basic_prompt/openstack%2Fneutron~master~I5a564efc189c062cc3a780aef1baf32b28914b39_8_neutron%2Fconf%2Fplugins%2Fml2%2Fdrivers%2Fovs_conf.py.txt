 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses some deprecated options and features, such as the 'prevent_arp_spoofing' option, which is deprecated and will be removed in Ocata. It's recommended to remove this option and use the port security extension instead.

Additionally, the 'drop_flows_on_start' option is set to False by default, which means that the flow table will not be reset on start. This may cause brief traffic interruption. It's recommended to set this option to True to avoid any potential issues.

Finally, the 'tunnel_csum' option is set to False by default, which means that the tunnel header checksum will not be set on outgoing IP packets carrying GRE/VXLAN tunnels. It's recommended to set this option to True to ensure that the checksum is correctly set.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and secure, but it's important to address the deprecated features and options to ensure that the code remains secure and up-to-date.
