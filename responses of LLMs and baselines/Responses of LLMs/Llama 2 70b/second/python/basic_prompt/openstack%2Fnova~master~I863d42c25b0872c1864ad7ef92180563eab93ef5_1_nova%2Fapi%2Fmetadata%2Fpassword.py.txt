 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have a few suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent coding style:
The code uses both snake_case and camelCase for variable and function names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not annotated. Adding type hints and annotations will make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Function docstrings:
The functions lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and any other relevant information. Adding docstrings will make the code more understandable and easier to use.
4. Error handling:
The code raises bare exceptions without providing any context or error messages. It's better to catch specific exceptions and provide error messages that help the user understand what went wrong.
5. Consistent indentation:
The indentation of the code is not consistent. Some lines have four spaces, while others have six. It's better to use a consistent number of spaces for indentation.
6. Unused imports:
The code imports the `six` module but doesn't use it anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid cluttering the code.
7. Unnecessary blank lines:
There are several blank lines in the code that can be removed to make it more concise.
8. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as `CHUNKS` and `CHUNK_LENGTH`, are not very descriptive. It's better to use more descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand.
