 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential improvements that could be made to the code:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase convention, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. Some functions and variables have type hints, while others don't. It's better to add type hints and annotations for all functions and variables to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions and methods. Docstrings are useful for providing a brief description of the function or method, its purpose, and any parameters or return values. Adding docstrings can help make the code more understandable and easier to use.
4. Function signature:
The `select_destinations` function takes a `ctxt` parameter, which is not used anywhere in the function. It's better to remove the unused parameter to simplify the function signature.
5. Consistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is generally consistent, but there are a few places where the indentation is incorrect. For example, the `return` statement in the `select_destinations` function is not indented correctly. It's better to ensure consistent indentation throughout the code.
6. Comments:
The code has helpful comments that explain the purpose of the functions and methods. However, there are a few places where the comments could be more detailed or clearer. For example, the `update_aggregates` function could benefit from a more detailed comment explaining what aggregates are and why they are being updated.
7. Error handling:
The code has a few places where error handling could be improved. For example, in the `select_destinations` function, there is a catch-all `except` block that simply raises a `NoValidHost` exception without providing any useful information about the error. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, rather than relying on a catch-all block.
8. Code organization:
The code is organized into several functions and methods, but there are a few places where the organization could be improved. For example, the `update_aggregates` and `delete_aggregate` functions could be grouped together into a separate module or class, since they relate to aggregate management.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and secure. However, by addressing these suggestions, the code could be even more maintainable, readable, and efficient.
