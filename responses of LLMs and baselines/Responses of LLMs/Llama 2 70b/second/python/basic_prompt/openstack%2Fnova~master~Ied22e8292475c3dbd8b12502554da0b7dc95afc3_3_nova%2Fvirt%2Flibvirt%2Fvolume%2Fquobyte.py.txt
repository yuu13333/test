 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's functionality or readability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this doesn't necessarily affect security, it may make the code harder to read and understand. It's generally a good idea to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and variables lack docstrings, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can improve the code's readability and make it easier for others to work with.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports several modules that don't seem to be used anywhere, such as `nova.conf`, `nova.i18n`, and `nova.utils`. Unused imports can make the code harder to read and may lead to unnecessary dependencies. It's a good idea to remove unused imports to simplify the code.
4. Unnecessary variables:
Some variables, such as `SOURCE_PROTOCOL` and `SOURCE_TYPE`, are defined but never used. Removing unused variables can simplify the code and reduce clutter.
5. Complexity:
The code has a high level of complexity, with many interdependent functions and variables. While this doesn't necessarily impact security, it can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Consider breaking down the code into smaller, more manageable functions or modules to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Lack of error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors very well, with many functions throwing `nova_exception.InternalError` without providing much context. It's a good idea to improve error handling by providing more specific error messages and handling exceptions more gracefully.
7. Use of `utils.execute()`:
The code uses `utils.execute()` to run commands, which can be a security risk if the commands being executed are not properly sanitized. Make sure to use safe functions like `subprocess.check_output()` or `subprocess.run()` instead, which automatically sanitize input and avoid shell injection vulnerabilities.

Overall, while there are no direct security defects in the code, addressing these issues can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security posture.
