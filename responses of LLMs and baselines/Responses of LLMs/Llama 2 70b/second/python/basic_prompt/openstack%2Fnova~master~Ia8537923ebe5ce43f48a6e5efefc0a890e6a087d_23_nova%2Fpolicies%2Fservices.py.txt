 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The code has docstrings for the policies, but they are not consistent. Some docstrings are missing, and some have incorrect formatting. It's better to have consistent and properly formatted docstrings for all policies.
3. Deprecated rules:
The code has deprecated rules with a reason and a version number. However, it's missing a clear plan for how to handle deprecated rules in the future. It's better to have a clear plan for deprecating rules, such as a timeline for when they will be removed and a process for updating the code to remove them.
4. Scope types:
The code uses scope_types=['system'] for all policies. It's better to use a more specific scope type, such as scope_types=['system', 'project'], to limit the scope of the policies to only the system or project level.
5. Missing permissions:
The code has policies with operations that don't have any permissions associated with them. For example, the 'GET' operation in the 'list' policy doesn't have any permissions. It's better to add permissions to all operations to ensure that the policies are properly enforced.
6. Unused variables:
The code has unused variables, such as 'DEPRECATED_SERVICE_POLICY' and 'DEPRECATED_REASON'. It's better to remove unused variables to keep the code clean and maintainable.
7. Consistency in indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation. It's better to have consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.
8. Trailing commas:
The code has trailing commas in some list definitions. It's better to remove trailing commas to avoid potential issues in the future.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand. However, it's important to address the points mentioned above to ensure that the code is consistent, maintainable, and secure.
