 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and organization:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations sparingly. Adding more type hints and annotations can help make the code more readable and easier to understand, especially for functions and variables that are not immediately obvious.
3. Function naming:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are shorter and less descriptive. Try to use descriptive names for all functions, and avoid using abbreviations or single-letter variable names.
4. Code organization:
The code is organized into several classes and functions, but it's not immediately clear how they relate to each other. Consider breaking the code up into smaller modules or classes, each with its own clear responsibilities and functions. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.
5. Comments and documentation:
The code includes some comments and documentation, but there is room for improvement. Consider adding more comments and documentation to explain the purpose and behavior of each function and class, especially for complex parts of the code.
6. Error handling:
The code includes some error handling, but it's not comprehensive. Consider adding more error handling and exception handling to ensure that the code can gracefully handle unexpected errors and exceptions.
7. Code style:
The code generally adheres to a consistent style, but there are a few minor issues. For example, some lines
