 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for class names and snake_case for variable names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand, and will also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The code can benefit from adding docstrings for functions, classes, and variables. Docstrings provide a brief description of what the code does, which can help others understand the code without having to read through it line by line.
4. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have a single newline character at the end of their signature, while others have multiple newline characters. It's better to be consistent with the number of newline characters used in function signatures.
5. Trailing commas:
Some function signatures have trailing commas, while others do not. It's better to be consistent with using or not using trailing commas in function signatures.
6. Variable naming:
Some variable names are descriptive, while others are not. It's better to use descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand. For example, instead of using `f`, `permitted_auth_types_cnt`, and `client_auth`, consider using `auth_types_count`, `permitted_auth_types_count`, and `client_auth_type`.
7. Function logic:
The `connect` function has a complex logic that is difficult to follow. Consider breaking down the function into smaller functions each with a single responsibility, this will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
8. Error handling:
The code has a few places where it raises an exception without properly handling it. Consider adding proper error handling mechanisms, such as catch blocks, to handle unexpected errors gracefully.
9. Code organization:
The code is organized in a way that makes it difficult to follow. Consider reorganizing the code to group related functions and variables together, this will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
10. Code style:
The code has a few places where the style is not consistent, for example, some lines are too long, and some indentation is not correct. Consider using a consistent code style throughout the code.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and it's good to see that it's using security-related libraries and following security best practices. With the suggested improvements, the code can become more readable, maintainable, and secure.
