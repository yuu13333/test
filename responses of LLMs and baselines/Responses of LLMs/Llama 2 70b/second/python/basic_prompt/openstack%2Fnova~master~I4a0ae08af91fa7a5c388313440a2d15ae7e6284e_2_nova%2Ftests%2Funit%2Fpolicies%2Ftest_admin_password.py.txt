 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's a good practice to use type hints and annotations for all function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Docstrings:
The code doesn't have docstrings for most of the functions, including the test methods. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions, especially for test methods, to explain what the function does and what it tests.
4. Mocking:
The code uses the `mock` library to mock the `get_instance` function, but it doesn't use the `mock.patch` function to mock the `API.set_admin_password` function. Instead, it uses a raw `mock.patch` object. It's better to use the `mock.patch` function to mock the function and specify the mock behavior.
5. Test organization:
The code has two test classes, `AdminPasswordPolicyTest` and `AdminPasswordScopeTypePolicyTest`, that test similar functionality. It's better to organize the tests into a single class and use test methods with descriptive names to test different scenarios. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
6. Test scoping:
The code sets up a fake instance and a fake request object in the `setUp` method, but it doesn't use them in the `test_change_password_policy` method. Instead, it creates new instances of the `fakes.HTTPRequest` and `fake_instance` classes. It's better to use the instances created in the `setUp` method to avoid code duplication.
7. Code style:
The code uses a mix of 4-space and 8-space indentation. It's better to use a consistent indentation size throughout the code.
8. Unused imports:
The code imports the `timeutils` module, but it's not used anywhere. It's better to remove the unused import to avoid cluttering the code.
