 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variable names are camelCase, while others are separated by underscores. It is better to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code for easier readability and maintenance.
2. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Adding comments to explain the purpose of each section, function, and variable will help in understanding the code better. It will also make it easier for others to contribute to the codebase.
3. Function naming:
Some function names are not descriptive, making it difficult to understand their purpose. For example, `docker_build` and `docker_run` could be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `build_docker_image` and `start_docker_container`.
4. Error handling:
The code uses `exit(-1)` to terminate the program when an error occurs. Instead, it's better to use a more robust error handling mechanism, such as raising custom exceptions or using the `sys.exit` function.
5. Security:
Although there are no security defects in the code, it's essential to note that Docker images and containers can have security vulnerabilities. It's recommended to use the latest version of Docker and keep the images and containers up-to-date. Additionally, it's a good practice to run the containers with minimal privileges and use tools like Docker Content Trust to ensure the integrity of the images.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to maintain and scale. It's recommended to break the code into smaller modules or files, each with its own specific functionality. This will make it easier to understand, test, and maintain the codebase.
7. Testing:
The code has a testing function called `docker_exec`, which checks if the container is ready for testing. However, it's not clear how this function is being called or if it's being used at all. It's recommended to add more tests to the codebase to ensure its functionality and reliability.
8. Environment variables:
The code uses environment variables to store sensitive information such as passwords. It's recommended to use secure ways of storing and retrieving sensitive information, such as using Docker secrets or environment variables with encrypted values.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and the functionality appears to be sound. However, following the best practices mentioned above will make the code more maintainable, secure, and easier to understand.
