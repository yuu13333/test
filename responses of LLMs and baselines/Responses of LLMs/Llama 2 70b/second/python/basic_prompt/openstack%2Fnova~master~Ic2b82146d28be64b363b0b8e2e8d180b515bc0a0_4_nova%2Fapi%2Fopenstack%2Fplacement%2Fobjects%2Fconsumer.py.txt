 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
In some places, the code uses camelCase naming conventions (e.g., "consumer_obj"), while in other places, it uses underscores (e.g., "project_external_id"). It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's a good practice to include type hints and annotations for all function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
3. Function docstrings:
Some functions lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and any exceptions they may raise. It's helpful to include docstrings for all functions to provide context and make the code easier to understand.
4. Consistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is inconsistent in some places. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.
5. Unused imports:
The code imports some modules that are not used, such as "sqlalchemy.orm." It's better to remove unused imports to avoid clutter and make the code easier to maintain.
6. Unnecessary comments:
Some comments in the code are unnecessary and can be removed. For example, the comment "Create a record in the projects table for our incomplete project" is not necessary, as the code clearly indicates what it does.
7. Missing docstrings:
Some classes and functions lack docstrings that describe their purpose and behavior. It's helpful to include docstrings for all classes and functions to provide context and make the code easier to understand.
8. Inconsistent variable naming:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore naming conventions for variables. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and I did not detect any security defects. However, following the best practices mentioned above can make the code more readable and maintainable.
