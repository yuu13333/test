 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's reliability and maintainability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to read and understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future. It's generally a good idea to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the codebase.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the functions and classes in the code do not have docstrings. Docstrings are useful for providing a brief explanation of the function or class's purpose, parameters, return values, and any other relevant information. Adding docstrings can help make the code more readable and easier to understand, which can reduce the likelihood of errors and improve maintainability.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports the `batch_notifier` module, but it does not seem to be used anywhere. Unused imports can make the code harder to read and may indicate a missing functionality. It's a good practice to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
4. Unused variables:
The code defines some variables that do not seem to be used anywhere, such as `KEEPALIVED_STATE_CHANGE_SERVER_BACKLOG`. While this may not be a security issue, it can make the code harder to read and understand, and may indicate a missing functionality. It's a good practice to remove unused variables to keep the code clean and maintainable.
5. Missing error handling:
The code does not seem to handle errors when spawning the keepalived notifications server in the `_start_keepalived_notifications_server` function. It's a good practice to add error handling to ensure that the code can recover gracefully in case of failures.

Overall, while there are no direct security defects in the code, addressing these issues can help improve the code's reliability and maintainability.
