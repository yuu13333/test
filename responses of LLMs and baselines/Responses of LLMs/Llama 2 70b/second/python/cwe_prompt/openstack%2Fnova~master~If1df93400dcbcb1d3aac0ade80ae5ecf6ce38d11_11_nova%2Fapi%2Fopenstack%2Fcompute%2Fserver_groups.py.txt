 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, it's worth noting that the codebase has undergone significant changes since the last release, and a thorough security review would still be beneficial to ensure that the code meets the latest security standards.

Additionally, it's always a good practice to perform security testing and code reviews regularly, even for open-source projects with a large and active community like Nova. This helps to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities before they become a problem.
