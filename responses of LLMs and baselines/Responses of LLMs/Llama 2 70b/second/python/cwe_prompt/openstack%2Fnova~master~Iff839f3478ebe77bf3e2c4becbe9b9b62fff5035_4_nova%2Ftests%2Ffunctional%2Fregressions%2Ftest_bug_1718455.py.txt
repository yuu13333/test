 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in code formatting:
The code uses both 4-space and 8-space indentations. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Comments and docstrings:
The code has minimal comments and docstrings. Adding more comments and docstrings can help make the code more readable and understandable.
3. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as `flavors` and `servers`, are not very descriptive. Consider using more descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand.
4. Function naming:
The function names are descriptive, but they are also quite long. Consider using shorter function names that still convey the same meaning.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into several modules, but some of the modules have a lot of functions. Consider breaking down the larger modules into smaller ones to make the code easier to navigate.
6. Testing:
The code has a good amount of test coverage, but it's always a good idea to add more tests to ensure that the code is comprehensive and robust.
7. Code style:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case variable naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
8. Unused code:
The code has some unused imports and variables. Consider removing them to make the code more concise and easier to read.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand. With a few improvements, it can become even better.
