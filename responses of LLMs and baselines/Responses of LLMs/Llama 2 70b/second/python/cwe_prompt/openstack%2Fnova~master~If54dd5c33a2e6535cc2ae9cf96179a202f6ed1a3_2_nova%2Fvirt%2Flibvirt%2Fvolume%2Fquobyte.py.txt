 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's functionality or performance:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to read and maintain. It's generally a good idea to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code.
2. Unused imports:
The code imports the `six` module, but it doesn't seem to be used anywhere. Unused imports can make the code harder to understand and may lead to unnecessary dependencies. It's a good practice to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
3. Unnecessary complexity:
The `is_systemd()` function seems to be overly complex. It checks if the host is running systemd, but it does so by executing a command that may not be necessary in all cases. Instead, the function could simply check if the `systemd` executable exists or if the `systemctl` command is available. This would make the function more straightforward and efficient.
4. Redundant logging:
The code logs the same message multiple times in different places, such as "Mounted volume: %s" and "Trying to disconnected unmounted volume at %s". While this may not be a security issue, it could make the logs harder to read and understand. It's generally a good idea to minimize redundant logging and only log relevant information once.
5. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and variables lack docstrings that describe their purpose and usage. Docstrings are important for code readability and can help other developers understand the code more easily. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions and variables that are not self-explanatory.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, there are some areas where the code could be improved for better readability, maintainability, and performance.
