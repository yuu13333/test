 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out some minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent indentation: The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines have four spaces, while others have eight. It is recommended to use a consistent number of spaces for indentation to make the code more readable.
2. Variable naming: Some variable names, such as 'KEEPALIVED_STATE_CHANGE_SERVER_BACKLOG', are quite long and difficult to read. It would be better to use shorter and more descriptive variable names.
3. Function naming: Some function names, such as 'enqueue_state_change', are not very descriptive. It would be better to use more descriptive function names to indicate their purpose.
4. Type hints: Some function parameters and variables do not have type hints. Adding type hints can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
5. Docstrings: Some functions and classes do not have docstrings. Adding docstrings can provide information about the purpose and usage of the functions and classes.
6. Code organization: The code is organized into multiple classes and functions, but it would be better to group related functions and variables into separate modules or classes. This would make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
7. Error handling: The code does not handle errors very well. It would be better to add try-except blocks to handle errors and provide meaningful error messages.
8. Testing: The code does not have any testing functions. It would be better to add testing functions to ensure that the code works correctly and to catch any bugs.

Overall, the code appears to be well-struct
