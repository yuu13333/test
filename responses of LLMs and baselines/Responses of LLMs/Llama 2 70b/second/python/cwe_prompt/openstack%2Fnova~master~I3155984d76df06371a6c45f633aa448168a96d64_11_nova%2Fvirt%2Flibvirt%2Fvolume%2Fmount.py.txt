 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code doesn't have type hints or annotations for function parameters, return types, or variable declarations. Adding type hints and annotations can make the code more readable and easier to understand, and can also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The code doesn't have docstrings for functions or classes. Docstrings can provide information about the purpose and usage of functions and classes, which can help other developers understand the code better.
4. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors very well. For example, in the `mount` method, if the mount command fails, the code raises an exception without providing any useful error message. It's better to catch specific errors and provide meaningful error messages.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to manage and maintain. It's better to break the code into smaller modules or classes, each with its own responsibilities and functions.
6. Comments:
The code has very few comments. Adding comments can help explain the purpose and usage of functions, methods, and classes, and can make the code easier to understand.
7. Code style:
The code uses inconsistent indentation and spacing. It's better to follow a consistent coding style throughout the code.
8. Testing:
The code doesn't seem to have any tests. Adding tests can help ensure that the code works correctly and can catch bugs before they reach production.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there are some areas where it can be improved to make it more readable, maintainable, and secure.
