 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improving the code's readability and maintainability:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable and method names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code doesn't have type hints or annotations for function parameters, return types, or variable types. Adding type hints and annotations can make the code easier to understand and help catch type-related errors.
3. Docstrings:
The code doesn't have docstrings for functions, classes, or modules. Docstrings can help provide context and explain the purpose of the code, making it easier for others to understand and maintain.
4. Modularity:
The code is tightly coupled, with many methods and variables defined inside a single class. It's better to break the code into smaller, modular classes and functions to improve maintainability and reusability.
5. Comments:
The code has minimal comments. Adding comments can help explain the purpose of the code and make it easier to understand.
6. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors well. It's better to handle errors appropriately, with clear error messages and proper logging.
7. Consistent indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to use consistent indentation to make the code easier to read.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but following best practices for naming conventions, type hints, docstrings, modularity, comments, error handling, and indentation can make it more maintainable and easier to understand.
