 I have reviewed the provided code and have identified a potential security defect.

The defect is related to the use of the `time.time()` function to measure the time interval between calls to the `Throttler` class's `call()` method. Specifically, the `time.time()` function can be vulnerable to attacks that manipulate the system clock, such as clock skew or clock tampering.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the system clock to make it appear as though a certain amount of time has passed, when in reality, it has not. This could allow the attacker to bypass the throttling mechanism and make more frequent calls to the `function` than intended.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more secure method for measuring time intervals, such as using the `timeutils.is_older_than()` function, which is already being used in the `is_agent_down()` function. This function uses a monotonic clock, which is less susceptible to clock manipulation attacks.

Here's an example of how the `Throttler` class could be modified to use the `timeutils.is_older_than()` function:
```python
class Throttler(object):
    def __init__(self, threshold=0):
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.last_time_called = timeutils.monotonic_time() - threshold

    def call(self, function, *args, **kwargs):
        # Check if another thread hasn't already scheduled 'function' to run.
        # If it has been, then it will do so in less than 'self.threshold'
        # seconds.
        if not self.is_deferred:
            time_since_last_call = timeutils.is_older_than(
                timeutils.monotonic_time(),
                self.last_time_called + self.threshold)
            if time_since_last_call:
                # We're in timeout, so we should throttle future calls.
                self.is_deferred = True
                time_to_wait = self.threshold - time_since_last_call
                eventlet.sleep(time_to_wait)

            self.last_time_called = timeutils.monotonic_time()
            try:
                function(*args, **kwargs)
            finally:
                self.is_deferred = False
```
By making this change, the `Throttler` class will be less vulnerable to clock manipulation attacks, and the security defect will be mitigated.
