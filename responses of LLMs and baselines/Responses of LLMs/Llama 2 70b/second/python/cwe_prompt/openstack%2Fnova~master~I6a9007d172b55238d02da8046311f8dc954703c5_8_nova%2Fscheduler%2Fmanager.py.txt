 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
In some places, the naming conventions are not consistent. For example, in the `select_destinations` method, the variable `alloc_reqs_by_rp_uuid` is defined, but in the `update_aggregates` method, the variable `aggregates` is defined without the underscore prefix. It is recommended to use consistent naming conventions throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations in some places, but not consistently. It is recommended to use type hints and annotations consistently throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.
3. docstrings:
Some methods lack docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It is recommended to add docstrings for all methods, including a brief description of the method, its purpose, and any parameters or return values.
4. Error handling:
The code uses `exception.NoValidHost` to indicate that no valid host was found. However, it is not clear what the caller should do in this case. It is recommended to provide more information about how the caller should handle this error, such as logging an error message or providing a default host.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into several methods, but some methods are quite long and complex. It is recommended to break down the longer methods into smaller methods to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Comments:
Some places in the code have comments that are not clear or up-to-date. It is recommended to review and update the comments to ensure that they accurately reflect the code's purpose and usage.
7. Code style:
Some places in the code have inconsistent indentation or spacing. It is recommended to follow a consistent coding style throughout the code to improve readability.
8. Testing:
The code does not include any tests. It is recommended to add tests to ensure that the code functions correctly and to catch any bugs early in the development process.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and there are no obvious security defects. However, following the recommendations above can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality.
