 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints: The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
3. Error handling: The code catches some specific exceptions, such as `jsonschema.ValidationError` and `exception.ResourceClassNotFound`, but it doesn't handle other potential exceptions that might occur. It's a good practice to handle all exceptions and provide informative error messages.
4. Security: The code uses `jsonutils.dumps()` to serialize data to JSON. However, it's better to use `jsonutils.encode()` instead, which takes an additional argument for the encoding scheme, making it more secure.
5. Code organization: The code is organized into different sections, but some functions are quite long. It's a good practice to break long functions into smaller ones, each with a single responsibility, to improve code readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, it's always a good idea to keep improving and refining the code to make it more secure, readable, and maintainable.
