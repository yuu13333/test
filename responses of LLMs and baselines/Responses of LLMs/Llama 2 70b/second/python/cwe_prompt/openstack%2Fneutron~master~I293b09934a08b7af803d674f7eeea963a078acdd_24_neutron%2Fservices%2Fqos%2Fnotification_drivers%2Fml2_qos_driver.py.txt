 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses a number of global variables and functions, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain. It would be better to use a more modular and functional programming approach, where each function has a clear and limited scope, and dependencies are explicitly passed as arguments.

Additionally, some of the function names are quite long and complex, which can make them difficult to read and understand. It would be better to use shorter and more descriptive function names, and to use consistent naming conventions throughout the code.

Finally, the code uses a number of commented-out lines and code blocks, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain. It would be better to remove these comments and unused code, or to use a version control system to track changes and maintain a history of the code.
