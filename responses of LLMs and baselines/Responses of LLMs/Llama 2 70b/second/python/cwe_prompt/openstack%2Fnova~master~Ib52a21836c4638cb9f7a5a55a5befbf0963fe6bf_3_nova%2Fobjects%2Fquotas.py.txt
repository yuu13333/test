 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out some minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some method names use camelCase convention (e.g., "ids_from_instance"), while others use underscores (e.g., "limit_check_project_and_user"). It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. For example, the "ids_from_instance" function has no type hints, while other functions have type hints for their parameters and return types. It's better to use type hints and annotations consistently throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.
3. Function signature:
The "ids_from_instance" function takes two parameters, "context" and "instance," but only uses the "instance" parameter. The unused "context" parameter can be removed to simplify the function signature.
4. Code organization:
The code is organized using a mix of functional programming and object-oriented programming techniques. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it may make the code harder to understand and maintain. It's worth considering organizing the code into smaller, more focused functions or classes to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Comments and docstrings:
The code has minimal comments and docstrings. Adding more comments and docstrings can help improve the readability and understandability of the code, especially for other developers who may need to work with the code in the future.
6. Error handling:
The "check_deltas" function catches the "OverQuota" exception but does not handle it appropriately. Instead of raising the exception again, it's better to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.
7. Code style:
The code uses inconsistent indentation and spacing. It's better to follow a consistent coding style throughout the code to improve readability.

Overall, while the code appears to be secure, following best practices for code organization, naming conventions, type hints, and error handling can improve its readability and maintainability.
