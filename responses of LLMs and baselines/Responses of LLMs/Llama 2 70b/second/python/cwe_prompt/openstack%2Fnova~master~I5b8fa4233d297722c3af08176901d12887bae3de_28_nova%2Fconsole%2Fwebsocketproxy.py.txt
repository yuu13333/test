 No security defects are detected in the code.

Nevertheless, here are some observations and suggestions for improving the code quality and security:

1. Consistent coding style:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Comments and documentation:
The code has minimal comments and documentation. Adding clear and concise comments and docstrings can help understand the code's purpose, parameters, and return values, making it easier to maintain and modify.
3. Error handling and logging:
The code has a few places where exceptions are raised without proper error handling or logging. It's essential to handle exceptions appropriately, log the errors, and provide informative error messages to the user.
4. Security-related imports:
The code imports `cookie` and `mask_token` modules, which are not used anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to minimize the attack surface and reduce potential vulnerabilities.
5. Token validation:
The code validates the token passed in the request's `GET` method. However, it's not clear how the token is generated and validated. It's recommended to use a secure token generation and validation mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT, to ensure the token's authenticity and integrity.
6. Origin validation:
The code validates the `Origin` header to ensure it matches one of the allowed origins. However, it's not clear how the allowed origins are configured. It's recommended to use a secure mechanism, such as a whitelist or blacklist, to manage the allowed origins.
7. Socket creation and handling:
The code creates a socket using the `socket()` method and handles it directly. It's better to use a secure socket creation and handling mechanism, such as `ssl.create_default_context()` and `ssl.SSLSocket()`, to ensure the communication is encrypted and secure.
8. Information disclosure:
The code logs sensitive information, such as the client's IP address and the proxy's access URL, at the debug level. It's recommended to avoid logging sensitive information and instead log only the necessary information at a lower log level, such as `INFO`.

By addressing these observations and suggestions, the code's security and quality can be improved, reducing potential vulnerabilities and enhancing its overall stability and maintainability.
