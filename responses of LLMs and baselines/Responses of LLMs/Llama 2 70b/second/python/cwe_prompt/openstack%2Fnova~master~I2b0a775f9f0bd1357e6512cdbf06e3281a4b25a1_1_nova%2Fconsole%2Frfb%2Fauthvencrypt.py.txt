 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose and parameters. Adding docstrings can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused imports:
The code imports the `enum` module, but it doesn't seem to be used anywhere. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid cluttering the code.
4. Unnecessary blank lines:
There are several blank lines in the code that can be removed to make it more concise.
5. Compare with constants using `is`:
In line 107, `AuthVeNCryptSubtype.X509NONE not in sub_types` can be replaced with `AuthVeNCryptSubtype.X509NONE is not sub_types`. This is a more Pythonic way to compare with constants.
6. Use consistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is inconsistent. It's better to use consistent indentation to make the code more readable.
7. Use `str.format()` instead of `%`:
In line 141, `reason = _("Error establishing TLS connection to server: %s") % (six.text_type(e)))` can be replaced with `reason = _("Error establishing TLS connection to server: {}").format(six.text_type(e))`. This is a more Pythonic way to format strings.
8. Use `ssl.create_default_context()` instead of `ssl.wrap_socket()`:
In line 138, `wrapped_sock = ssl.wrap_socket(compute_sock, ...)` can be replaced with `context = ssl.create_default_context(); wrapped_sock = context.wrap_socket(compute_sock, ...)`. This is a more Pythonic way to create an SSL context and wrap a socket.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and secure. However, following these best practices can make it more readable, maintainable, and secure.
