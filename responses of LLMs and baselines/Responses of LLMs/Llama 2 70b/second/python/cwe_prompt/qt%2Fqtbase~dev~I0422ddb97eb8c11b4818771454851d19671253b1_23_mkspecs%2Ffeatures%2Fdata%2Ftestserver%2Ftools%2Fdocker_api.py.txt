 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and consistency.
2. Missing docstrings: Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and other relevant information. Adding docstrings can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Unused variables: The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `maintainer` in the `DockerConfig` class. It's better to remove unused variables to reduce code clutter and minimize potential bugs.
4. Complexity: Some functions, such as `docker_build` and `docker_run`, have a high cyclomatic complexity. It's better to break down these functions into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Error handling: The code uses `exit(-1)` to terminate the program when an error occurs. Instead, it's better to use specific error handling mechanisms, such as raising exceptions or logging errors, to handle errors in a more structured way.
6. Insecure commands: The code uses `check_call` and `check_output` to execute commands that may be insecure, such as `docker run` with the `-h` flag. It's better to use secure alternatives, such as `subprocess.run` with the `shell=True` argument, to avoid potential command injection vulnerabilities.
7. Missing tests: The code lacks tests for some functions, such as `docker_exec` and `docker_rmi`. It's better to add tests for these functions to ensure their correctness and reliability.
8. Code organization: The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to manage and maintain. It's better to split the code into smaller files or modules to improve code organization and reusability.

Overall, the code appears to be secure, but following these best practices can improve its quality, readability, and maintainability.
