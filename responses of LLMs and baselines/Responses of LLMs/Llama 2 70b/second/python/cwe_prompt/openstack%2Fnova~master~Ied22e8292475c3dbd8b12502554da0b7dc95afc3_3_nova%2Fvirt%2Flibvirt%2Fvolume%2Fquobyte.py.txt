 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints:
The function signatures could benefit from type hints for the input parameters and return types. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Error handling:
The code catches generic exceptions like `Exception` and `OSError`, but it's better to catch specific exceptions like `nova_exception.InternalError` instead. This will make the error handling more targeted and informative.
4. Logging:
The code uses `LOG.debug()` and `LOG.info()` for logging, but it's better to use a more specific log level like `LOG.trace()` or `LOG.warning()` depending on the context.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into separate functions, which is good. However, it might be beneficial to group related functions together into modules or classes for better maintainability.
6. Comments:
The code has adequate comments, but it's always a good idea to have more comments to explain the purpose of the code and any assumptions made. This will make the code easier to understand for other developers.
7. Testing:
It's essential to have thorough tests for the code to ensure it works correctly in different scenarios. Writing test cases for edge cases and exception handling will help improve the code's reliability.
8. Security:
The code uses `os.access()` to check if a file is writable, but it's not enough to ensure that the file is indeed writable by the current user. It's better to use `os.path.exists()` and `os.path.iswritable()` instead to check if the file exists and is writable by the current user.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to follow. With a few improvements, it can become even more maintainable, readable, and secure.
