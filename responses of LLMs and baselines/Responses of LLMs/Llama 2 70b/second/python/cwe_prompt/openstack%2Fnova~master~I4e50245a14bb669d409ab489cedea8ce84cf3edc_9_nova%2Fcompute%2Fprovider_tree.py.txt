 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the code's reliability and maintainability:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it could make the code harder to read and understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future. It's generally a good idea to stick to a single naming convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings: Some of the functions and classes in the code do not have docstrings. Docstrings are important for providing context and information about the purpose and behavior of the code. Adding docstrings can help other developers understand the code more easily and reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings or errors.
3. Unused imports: The code imports the `logging` module, but it does not seem to be used anywhere. Unused imports can make the code harder to read and may introduce unnecessary dependencies. It's generally a good idea to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.
4. Unnecessary comments: Some of the comments in the code seem to be unnecessary or redundant. While comments are important for explaining the code, unnecessary comments can make the code harder to read and may introduce confusion. It's generally a good idea to remove unnecessary comments and focus on adding clear and concise comments that explain the code's purpose and behavior.

Overall, while there are no direct security defects in the code, addressing these issues can help improve the code's readability, maintainability, and reliability.
