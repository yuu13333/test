 I have reviewed the code and did not detect any security defects. The code seems to be well-structured and follows good coding practices.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. Line 14: The `ALIAS` constant is defined without any description or comment. It would be helpful to add a brief description of what this constant represents.
2. Line 18: The `IS_SHIM_EXTENSION` constant is defined without any description or comment. It would be helpful to add a brief description of what this constant represents.
3. Line 24: The `IS_STANDARD_ATTR_EXTENSION` constant is defined without any description or comment. It would be helpful to add a brief description of what this constant represents.
4. Line 35: The `UPDATED_TIMESTAMP` constant is defined without any description or comment. It would be helpful to add a brief description of what this constant represents.
5. Line 47: The `ACTION_MAP` constant is defined without any description or comment. It would be helpful to add a brief description of what this constant represents.
6. Line 51: The `ACTION_STATUS` constant is defined without any description or comment. It would be helpful to add a brief description of what this constant represents.
7. Line 55: The `REQUIRED_EXTENSIONS` constant is defined without any description or comment. It would be helpful to add a brief description of what this constant represents.
8. Line 59: The `OPTIONAL_EXTENSIONS` constant is defined without any description or comment. It would be helpful to add a brief description of what this constant represents.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, and I did not detect any security defects.
