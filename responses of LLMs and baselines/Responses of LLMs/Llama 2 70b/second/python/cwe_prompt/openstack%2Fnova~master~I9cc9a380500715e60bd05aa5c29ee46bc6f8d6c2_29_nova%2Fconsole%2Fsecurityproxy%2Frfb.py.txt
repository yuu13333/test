 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations sparingly. Adding more type hints and annotations can help improve code readability and make it easier for others to understand the code's intent.
3. docstrings:
The code has limited docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and usage of certain functions, classes, and variables. Adding more docstrings can help improve code readability and provide better context for the code.
4. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have inconsistent signatures, such as the `__init__` method, which takes no arguments, while other methods take variable number of arguments. It's better to make the signature consistent throughout the code.
5. Error handling:
The code has limited error handling, and some places may benefit from more robust error handling. For example, in the `connect` method, there are several places where an exception is raised without properly handling the error.
6. Security considerations:
The code uses the `six` library to handle both Python 2 and 3 compatibility, but it's not clear why this is necessary in this codebase. If the codebase is only targeting Python 3, it may be possible to remove the `six` dependency and use Python 3's built-in functionality instead.
7. Code organization:
The code is organized into several modules, but it's not clear why some functions are in the `base` module while others are in the `rfb` module. It may be beneficial to reorganize the code into more logical modules or namespaces to improve code readability and maintainability.
8. Unused code:
The codebase has some unused code, such as the `RFBSecurityProxyNegotiationFailed` exception, which is never used. It's better to remove unused code to avoid confusion and make the codebase more maintainable.

Overall, while the code appears to be secure, there are some areas where it could be improved for readability, maintainability, and consistency.
