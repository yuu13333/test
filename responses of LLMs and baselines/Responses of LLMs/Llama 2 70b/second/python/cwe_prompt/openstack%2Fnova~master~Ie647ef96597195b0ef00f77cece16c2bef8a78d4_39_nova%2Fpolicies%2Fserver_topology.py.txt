 I have reviewed the code and found a potential security defect.

The defect is related to the use of the `base.RULE_ADMIN_OR_OWNER` and `base.RULE_ADMIN_API` constants in the `policy.DocumentedRuleDefault` definitions. These constants are used to define the authorization rules for the policies, but they are not properly defined in the code.

The `base.RULE_ADMIN_OR_OWNER` constant is defined as `('admin_or_owner', 'admin_or_owner')`, but it is not properly imported or defined in the code. Similarly, the `base.RULE_ADMIN_API` constant is defined as `('admin_api', 'admin_api')`, but it is not properly imported or defined in the code.

This lack of proper definition and import of the authorization constants could lead to a situation where the policies are not properly authorized, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The solution is to properly import and define the authorization constants in the code, for example:
```
from nova.policies import base

BASE_POLICY_NAME = 'os_compute_api:servers:topology:%s'

server_topology_policies = [
    policy.DocumentedRuleDefault(
        BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'index',
        base.RULE_ADMIN_OR_OWNER,  # Import and use the proper authorization constant
        "Show NUMA topology data of a given server",
        [
            {
                'method': 'GET',
                'path': '/servers/{server_id}/topology'
            }
        ]),
    policy.DocumentedRuleDefault(
        # control host NUMA node and cpu pinning information
        BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'host_info:index',
        base.RULE_ADMIN_API,  # Import and use the proper authorization constant
        "List host NUMA id and cpu pinning information of given server",
        [
            {
                'method': 'GET',
                'path': '/servers/{server_id}/topology'
            }
        ]),
]
```
In addition, it's good practice to use constants for the policy names, instead of hardcoding them. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.

No other security defects were detected in the code.
