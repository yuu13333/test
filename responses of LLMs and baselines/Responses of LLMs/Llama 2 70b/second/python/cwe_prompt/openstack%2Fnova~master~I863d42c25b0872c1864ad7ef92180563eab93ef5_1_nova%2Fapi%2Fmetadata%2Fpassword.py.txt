 I have reviewed the code and found a potential security defect.

Line 41:
The `convert_password` function takes a raw password as input and stores it as system metadata in the format of `password_0`, `password_1`, `password_2`, and `password_3`. This means that an attacker with access to the system metadata can easily retrieve the plaintext password by reading the values of these keys.

It is recommended to use a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt, argon2, or PBKDF2, to store passwords securely. These algorithms are specifically designed to slow down the process of password cracking and make it more difficult for attackers to retrieve the plaintext password.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `convert_password` function to use a secure password hashing algorithm instead of storing the plaintext password in system metadata. Here's an example of how you can modify the function to use bcrypt:
```python
import bcrypt

def convert_password(context, password):
    """Stores password as system_metadata items.

    Password is stored with the keys 'password_0' -> 'password_3'.
    """
    password = password or ''
    if six.PY3 and isinstance(password, bytes):
        password = password.decode('utf-8')

    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password, salt)

    meta = {}
    for i in range(CHUNKS):
        meta['password_%d' % i] = hashed_password[:CHUNK_LENGTH]
        hashed_password = hashed_password[CHUNK_LENGTH:]

    return meta
```
In this modified implementation, the `bcrypt` library is used to generate a salt and hash the password. The hashed password is then stored in system metadata in the format of `password_0`, `password_1`, `password_2`, and `password_3`.

By using a secure password hashing algorithm, you can ensure that the plaintext password is not easily accessible to attackers, even if they gain access to the system metadata.
