 I have analyzed the provided code and found a potential security vulnerability.

The function `create_process` creates a new process using the `subprocess` module, and it inherits the environment of the parent process. However, it does not perform any sanitization or validation of the input command, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious commands into the `cmd` parameter of the `create_process` function. For example, they can inject a command that spawns a shell, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the target system.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to perform sanitization and validation of the input command. For example, you can use the `argparse` module to parse the command and its arguments, and validate that the input is in a specific format. Additionally, you can use the `subprocess.check_output` function to execute the command in a secure manner, which will automatically sanitize the input and prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

Here's an example of how the `create_process` function can be modified to mitigate the vulnerability:
```python
import subprocess
import argparse

def create_process(cmd, run_as_root=False, addl_env=None):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('cmd', nargs='+', help='Command to execute')
    args = parser.parse_args(cmd)

    if not run_as_root and not subprocess.check_output(args.cmd, shell=False, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, env=os.environ).strip():
        raise exceptions.ProcessExecutionError('Command execution failed: ' + args.cmd[0])

    return subprocess.Popen(args.cmd, shell=False, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, env=os.environ)
```
In this modified implementation, the `argparse` module is used to parse the input command and its arguments. The `subprocess.check_output` function is used to execute the command in a secure manner, which will sanitize the input and prevent command injection vulnerabilities. The `run_as_root` parameter is also checked to ensure that the command is not executed with elevated privileges if it is not necessary.

I hope this helps to mitigate the security vulnerability in your code. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.
