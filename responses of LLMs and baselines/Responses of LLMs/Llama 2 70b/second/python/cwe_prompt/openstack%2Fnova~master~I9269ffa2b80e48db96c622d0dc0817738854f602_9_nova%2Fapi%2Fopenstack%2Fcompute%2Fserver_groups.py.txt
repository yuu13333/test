 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few potential issues that may not be directly related to security but could still impact the functionality of the code:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this may not be a security issue, it can make the code harder to read and understand. It's generally a good idea to stick to a single naming convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some of the functions and classes in the code do not have docstrings. Docstrings can help provide context and explanations for the purpose and usage of the functions and classes. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions and classes.
3. Unused variables and functions:
The code defines some variables and functions that are not used anywhere. For example, the `sg_policies` variable is defined but not used, and the `show` function has a docstring but is not called anywhere. It's a good practice to remove unused variables and functions to keep the code clean and maintainable.
4. Insecure data handling:
The code handles sensitive data, such as user IDs and project IDs, without proper validation or encryption. While this may not be a security issue in this specific code snippet, it's important to ensure that sensitive data is handled securely in the context of the larger application.

Overall, while there are no direct security defects in the code, following best practices for coding conventions, documentation, and data handling can help ensure the code is maintainable, readable, and secure.
