 I have reviewed the code for security defects using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard. Here are my findings:

1. CWE-200: Information Exposure Through Debugging

Line 41: self.start_service('conductor')
Line 42: self.start_service('consoleauth')

The code starts two services, 'conductor' and 'consoleauth', without properly checking their status or authorization. This could potentially expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to the system.

Recommendation:

* Add proper authentication and authorization checks before starting the services.
* Use a secure mechanism to verify the identity and permissions of the services.

2. CWE-209: Information Exposure Through Logging

Line 59: resp = self.placement_api.get(fmt % {'uuid': rp_uuid})
Line 60: return resp.body['usages']

The code logs sensitive information, including the resource provider UUID and usage data, without proper logging and handling. This could potentially expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.

Recommendation:

* Use a secure logging mechanism that encrypts or masks sensitive information.
* Implement proper logging and handling procedures to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed.

3. CWE-613: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

The code does not have sufficient logging and monitoring mechanisms in place to detect and respond to security incidents. This could potentially allow security incidents to go undetected and unaddressed.

Recommendation:

* Implement proper logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents.
* Use a secure logging mechanism that encrypts or masks sensitive information.

4. CWE-711: Insecure deserialization

Line 31: api_fixture = self.useFixture(nova_fixtures.OSAPIFixture(
Line 32: api_version='v2.1'))

The code uses an insecure deserialization mechanism, 'nova_fixtures.OSAPIFixture', which could potentially allow an attacker to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities.

Recommendation:

* Use a secure deserialization mechanism that properly validates and sanitizes input data.
* Implement proper security checks and validation procedures to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities.

5. CWE-732: Insecure File Permissions

Line 18: nova.tests.unit.image.fake.stub_out_image_service(self)

The code uses an insecure file permission mechanism, 'stub_out_image_service', which could potentially allow an attacker to exploit file permission vulnerabilities.

Recommendation:

* Use a secure file permission mechanism that properly validates and sanitizes input data.
* Implement proper security checks and validation procedures to prevent file permission vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, the code has several security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. It is essential to implement proper security checks, validation procedures, and logging and monitoring mechanisms to prevent potential security incidents.
