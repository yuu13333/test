 I have reviewed the code for security defects using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard. I have not detected any security defects in the code.

The code seems to be well-structured, and it uses various fixtures and mocking techniques to isolate dependencies and test the `WSGIAppTest` class in isolation. The code also uses the `tempfile` module to create a temporary configuration file, which is a good practice to avoid hardcoding sensitive data in the code.

The `setUp` method is used to set up the test environment, including disabling the `ConfigureLogging` fixture and creating a temporary configuration file. The `tearDown` method is used to clean up the test environment, including closing the temporary configuration file.

The `test_init_application_called_twice` method is a well-structured test that tests the `init_application` method's ability to tolerate being called twice in a single Python interpreter instance. The test uses various mocking techniques to simulate exceptions being raised during the initialization process and ensures that the `init_application` method is called only once and that the global data is not re-initialized.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, and I have not detected any security defects in the code.
