 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few best practices that could be applied to the code:

1. Consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints: The code uses type hints for some function parameters, but not for all. It's a good practice to add type hints for all function parameters to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings: The code has docstrings for some functions, but not for all. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions to provide a clear explanation of what the function does and what its parameters are.
4. Function signature: Some functions have a large number of parameters. It's a good practice to break down such functions into smaller functions with fewer parameters to make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Error handling: The code has a few places where an exception is caught and ignored. It's a good practice to handle exceptions properly and provide clear error messages to the user.
6. Consistent indentation: The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's a good practice to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it more readable.
7. Comments: The code has some comments that are not necessary and can be removed. It's a good practice to keep comments that explain the purpose of the code and remove unnecessary comments to avoid clutter.
