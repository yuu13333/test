 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code doesn't have type hints or annotations for function parameters and return types. Adding type hints and annotations can make the code more readable and easier to understand, and can also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. docstrings:
The code doesn't have docstrings for functions and classes. Docstrings can provide information about the purpose and usage of the functions and classes, and can help others understand the code better.
4. Consistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines have four spaces, while others have eight. It's better to use a consistent number of spaces for indentation to make the code more readable.
5. Utilize constants:
The code has some magic numbers and hardcoded values. It's better to define constants for these values and use them throughout the code. This can make the code more readable and easier to maintain.
6. Function signature:
The `load_interface_driver` function takes a `conf` parameter, but it's not clear what type of object `conf` should be. It's better to specify the type of the parameter using type hints.
7. Exception handling:
The `load_interface_driver` function raises a `SystemExit` exception if the driver cannot be loaded. However, it's not clear why this exception is being raised or how it should be handled. It's better to use a more specific exception type and handle it appropriately.
8. Consistent spacing:
There are inconsistent spaces between lines and between blocks of code. It's better to use consistent spacing to make the code more readable.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand. However, following coding standards and best practices can make the code more maintainable and easier to read for others.
