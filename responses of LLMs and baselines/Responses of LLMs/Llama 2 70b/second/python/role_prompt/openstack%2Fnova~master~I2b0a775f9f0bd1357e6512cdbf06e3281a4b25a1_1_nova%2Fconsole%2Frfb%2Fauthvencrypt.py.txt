 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not annotated with type hints. Adding type hints can make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for the functions, classes, and variables. Adding docstrings can help provide context and make the code easier to understand.
4. Consistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines have four spaces, while others have eight. It's better to use a consistent number of spaces for indentation.
5. SSL/TLS configuration:
The code uses the `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` constant to specify the TLS version. However, it's better to use the `ssl.TLS_VERSION_TLSv1_2` constant instead, as it's more readable and less prone to errors.
6. Error handling:
The code catches the `ssl.SSLError` exception but doesn't provide a specific error message. It's better to catch the exception and provide a specific error message that includes the details of the error.
7. Logging:
The code uses the `logging` module to log messages. However, it's better to use a more structured logging system, such as the `logging.getLogger(__name__).debug()` method, to log messages at different levels.
8. Consistent spacing:
The code has inconsistent spacing between lines and between blocks of code. It's better to use consistent spacing to make the code more readable.
9. Function signature:
The `security_handshake()` function takes a `compute_sock` parameter, but it's not clear what type of object this parameter should be. It's better to specify the type of object in the function signature.
10. Code organization:
The code is organized into different blocks, but it's not clear how these blocks are related. It's better to organize the code into separate functions or methods to make it easier to understand.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written, but there are some areas where it can be improved to make it more readable and maintainable.
