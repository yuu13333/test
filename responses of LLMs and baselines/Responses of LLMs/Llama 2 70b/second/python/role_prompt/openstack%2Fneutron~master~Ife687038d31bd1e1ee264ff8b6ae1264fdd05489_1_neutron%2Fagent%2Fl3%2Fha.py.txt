 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few possible improvements:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Type hints for function parameters:
Some functions lack type hints for their parameters. Adding type hints can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors early.
3. Consistency in spacing and indentation:
The code has inconsistent spacing and indentation in some places. It's better to maintain consistent spacing and indentation throughout the code for readability and to avoid errors.
4. Use of constants:
The code uses hardcoded values in some places, such as `KEEPALIVED_STATE_CHANGE_SERVER_BACKLOG`. It's better to define these values as constants at the top of the file for easier maintenance and readability.
5. Use of `os.path.join` instead of concatenation:
In some places, the code concatenates path components using string concatenation. It's better to use `os.path.join` instead, as it is more readable and avoids issues with paths that contain separators.
6. Use of `try...except` instead of `if...else`:
In some places, the code uses `if...else` blocks to handle errors. It's better to use `try...except` blocks instead, as they are more concise and easier to read.
7. Use of `config.ha_vrrp_advert_int` instead of hardcoded value:
The code uses a hardcoded value for the VRRP advertisement interval. It's better to use a configuration value instead, so that the interval can be easily changed without modifying the code.
8. Use of `batch_notifier.BatchNotifier` instead of `eventlet.spawn`:
The code uses `eventlet.spawn` to start the keepalived notifications server. It's better to use `batch_notifier.BatchNotifier` instead, as it provides a more elegant way to handle the notifications and reduces the boilerplate code.

I hope this feedback helps improve the code quality and security.
