 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent indentation: In some places, the indentation is not consistent, which can make the code harder to read. For example, in the `enqueue_state_change` method, the `if` statement has four spaces of indentation, while the `elif` statement has six spaces. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code.
2. Type hints: The code uses type hints for function parameters and return types, which is good. However, it would be even better to include type hints for variable definitions, especially in places where the variable type is not immediately obvious. For example, in the `enqueue_state_change` method, the `router_id` and `state` variables could have type hints added.
3. Variable naming: The code uses descriptive variable names, which is good. However, in some places, the variable names could be even more descriptive. For example, in the `enqueue_state_change` method, the `new_state` variable could be renamed to `new_ha_state` to make it clearer that it represents the new HA state.
4. Function naming: The code uses descriptive function names, which is good. However, in some places, the function names could be even more descriptive. For example, the `enqueue_state_change` method could be renamed to `enqueue_ha_state_change` to make it clearer that it enqueues a state change for the HA router.
5. Docstrings: The code includes docstrings for some functions, which is good. However, it
