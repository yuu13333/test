 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for variable names and snake_case for function names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters and return types. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand, and also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Error handling:
The code has a few places where it raises generic exceptions like `nova_exception.InternalError` or `processutils.ProcessExecutionError`. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, rather than catching a broad exception class and handling it generically. For example, in the `mount_volume` function, you can catch `processutils.ProcessExecutionError` and handle it differently than other exceptions.
4. Function documentation:
Some functions, like `validate_and_wait` and `_normalize_export`, lack documentation. It's helpful to add docstrings to these functions to explain their purpose and usage.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into separate functions, which is good. However, some functions are quite long and complex, like the `mount_volume` function. Consider breaking down these functions into smaller functions each with a single responsibility, which will make the code easier to read and maintain.
6. Use of constants:
The code uses hardcoded strings and integers in some places, like the `SOURCE_PROTOCOL` and `DRIVER_CACHE` constants. Consider defining these constants at the top of the file or in a separate constants file, and use them throughout the code instead of hardcoding them. This will make the code more readable and easier to maintain.
7. Use of `utils.execute`:
The code uses `utils.execute` to run shell commands. Consider using `subprocess` instead, which is a more modern and flexible way to run shell commands.
8. Use of `os.path.exists`:
The code uses `os.path.exists` to check if a file exists. Consider using `os.path.ismount` instead, which is a more efficient way to check if a file is a mount point.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to follow. With a few improvements, it can become even more maintainable and readable.
