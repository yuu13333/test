 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent, but there are a few inconsistencies. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use separate words with underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. Some function parameters and return types are annotated, while others are not. It's better to use type hints and annotations consistently throughout the code to make it easier to understand and maintain.
3. Function naming conventions:
Some function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention, while others are less descriptive or use inconsistent naming conventions. It's better to use descriptive function names that follow a consistent convention, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
4. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's better to add docstrings for all functions, including a brief description of the function's purpose, parameters, return types, and any other relevant information.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into separate modules and classes, which is good. However, some functions and variables are quite long and complex, making the code harder to read and maintain. It's better to break down long functions into smaller, more manageable functions and use descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand.
6. Error handling:
The code uses try-except blocks to handle errors, but some exceptions are not caught or logged properly. It's better to catch and log all exceptions, providing meaningful error messages to help diagnose issues.
7. Code style:
The code uses consistent indentation and spacing, but some lines are quite long, making the code harder to read. It's better to break long lines into shorter ones, using appropriate indentation and spacing to make the code more readable.
8. Testing:
The code lacks tests, which makes it difficult to ensure its correctness and reliability. It's better to add tests for all functions and classes, using a testing framework like pytest or unittest to verify the code's behavior and catch any bugs early in development.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there are some areas where it could be improved for better readability, maintainability, and security.
