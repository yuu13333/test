 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not properly annotated. Adding type hints and annotations would make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Error handling:
The code catches general exceptions and wraps them in a custom exception, but it doesn't provide any specific error messages or details. It's better to catch specific exceptions and provide detailed error messages to help debugging.
4. Consistency in indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines are indented with four spaces, while others are indented with eight spaces. It's better to stick to a single indentation size throughout the code.
5. Trailing commas:
Some of the lines have trailing commas, which can be removed to make the code more concise.
6. Unused imports:
The code imports some modules that are not used, such as `oslo_utils.excutils`. It's better to remove unused imports to avoid cluttering the code.
7. Code organization:
The code is quite long and complex, and it's not easy to follow. It's better to break the code into smaller functions or methods to make it more manageable.
8. Comments:
The code has some comments, but they are not very descriptive. Adding more detailed comments would help understand the purpose of the code and make it easier to maintain.
