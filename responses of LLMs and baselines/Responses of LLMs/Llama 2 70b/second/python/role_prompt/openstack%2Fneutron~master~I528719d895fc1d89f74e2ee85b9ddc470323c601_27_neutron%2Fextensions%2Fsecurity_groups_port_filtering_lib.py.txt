 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
In line 14, the alias is defined as 'port-security-groups-filtering', but in line 29, the name is defined as 'Port filtering on secuirty groups'. It would be better to keep the naming conventions consistent throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
The code does not include docstrings for the functions or classes defined in it. Adding docstrings would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Missing type hints:
The code does not include type hints for the variables or function parameters. Adding type hints would make the code more readable and easier to understand, and would also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
4. Use of constants:
The code defines several constants, such as ALIAS, IS_SHIM_EXTENSION, IS_STANDARD_ATTR_EXTENSION, NAME, DESCRIPTION, UPDATED_TIMESTAMP, and REQUIRED_EXTENSIONS. It would be better to define these constants in a separate constants file, and import them in the code, instead of defining them directly in the code. This would make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
5. Use of comments:
The code does not include comments explaining the purpose of the different sections or blocks of code. Adding comments would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
6. Use of consistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines have four spaces of indentation, while others have eight. It would be better to use consistent indentation throughout the code.
