 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few best practices that could be applied to the code:

1. Consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints: The code uses type hints for some function parameters, but not for all. It's a good practice to add type hints for all function parameters to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings: The code has docstrings for some functions, but not for all. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions to provide a clear understanding of what the function does and what its parameters are.
4. Error handling: The code raises a SystemExit(1) exception in the load_interface_driver function when an ImportError occurs. It's a good practice to catch the ImportError and log the error message instead of raising an exception.
5. Consistent indentation: The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's a good practice to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it more readable.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices.
