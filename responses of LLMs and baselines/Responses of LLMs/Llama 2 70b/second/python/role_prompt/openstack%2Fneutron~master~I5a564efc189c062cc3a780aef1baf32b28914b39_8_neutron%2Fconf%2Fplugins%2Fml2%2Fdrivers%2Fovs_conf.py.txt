 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses some deprecated options and features, such as the 'prevent_arp_spoofing' option, which is deprecated and will be removed in the Ocata release. It is recommended to remove this option and use the port security extension instead.

Additionally, the code uses the 'of_listen_address' and 'of_listen_port' options, which are only used for the 'native' driver. It is recommended to remove these options and use the 'of_interface' option instead, which is more flexible and can be used with different drivers.

Finally, the code uses the 'tunnel_csum' option, which is not a standard option and may cause compatibility issues with other OpenStack components. It is recommended to remove this option and use the standard 'csum' option instead.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and secure, but it could benefit from some minor improvements to remove deprecated features and improve compatibility.
