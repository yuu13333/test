 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The docstrings in the code are not consistently formatted. It's better to use a consistent format for docstrings, such as the one used in the Python documentation.
3. Line length:
Some lines are quite long and could be broken up into shorter lines for better readability. For example, line 45 is quite long and could be broken up into two lines.
4. Trailing commas:
Some dictionaries have trailing commas, which can be removed for better readability. For example, the dictionary on line 53 has a trailing comma that can be removed.
5. Redundant imports:
The code imports `policy` twice. It's better to remove the redundant import to avoid confusion.
6. Unused variables:
The code defines some variables that are not used anywhere, such as `DEPRECATED_INSTANCE_ACTION_POLICY` and `DEPRECATED_REASON`. It's better to remove these unused variables to avoid confusion.
7. Consistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code.
8. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings. It's better to add docstrings to provide information about the purpose and usage of these functions and classes.

Overall, the code seems well-structured and easy to understand. However, following these best practices can make the code even more readable and maintainable.
