 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
In line 13, `uuidsentinel` is imported, but in line 41, `uuids.fake_id` is used. It's better to stick to one naming convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and variables should have type hints and annotations to make the code more readable and maintainable. For example, in line 59, `mock_password` should have a type hint of `mock.Mock`.
3. Docstrings:
The docstrings for the classes and functions should be updated to provide a brief description of what the class or function does, what the parameters are, and what the return value is. This will make the code easier to understand for other developers who may need to work with it in the future.
4. Comments:
The comments in the code should be clear and descriptive. For example, in line 61, the comment should explain what the `rule_name` variable represents and why it's being used.
5. Code organization:
The code organization could be improved by breaking the long code block into smaller functions or methods. For example, the `setUp` method could be separated into smaller functions for each of the contexts being tested. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.
6. Test naming conventions:
The test method names should follow a consistent naming convention. For example, `test_change_password_policy` could be renamed to `test_change_password_policy_admin_authorized` to indicate that it's testing the admin-authorized context.
7. Test coverage:
The tests should cover all possible scenarios and edge cases. For example, what happens if the `change_password` API is called with an invalid password? What happens if the instance ID is invalid? What happens if the user is not authorized to access the instance?
8. Security-related improvements:
The code should include security-related improvements, such as input validation and error handling. For example, what happens if the `change_password` API is called with a password that contains malicious input? How does the code handle errors and exceptions?

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to follow. However, with a few improvements, it can be even better.
