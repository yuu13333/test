 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations: The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's better to use them consistently throughout the code to make it easier to understand and maintain.
3. Function docstrings: Some functions lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and exceptions. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions to make the code more readable and understandable.
4. Error handling: The code uses try-except blocks to handle errors, but in some places, the error handling seems incomplete or inconsistent. For example, in the `execute` function, there are several places where exceptions are raised without proper error handling. It's better to handle errors consistently and provide informative error messages.
5. Code organization: The code is organized into several functions, but some functions are quite long and complex. It's better to break down long functions into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Security considerations: The code uses `subprocess` to execute external commands, which can be a security risk if the input data is not properly sanitized. It's important to ensure that the input data is properly sanitized and validated to prevent command injection attacks.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to understand, but there are some areas where improvements can be made to make it more maintainable, readable, and secure.
