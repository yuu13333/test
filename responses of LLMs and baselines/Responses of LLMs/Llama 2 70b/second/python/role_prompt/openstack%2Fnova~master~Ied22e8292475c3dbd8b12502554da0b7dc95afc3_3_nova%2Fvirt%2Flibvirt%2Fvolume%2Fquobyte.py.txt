 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. For example, you can use camelCase for variable names and snake_case for function names.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters and return types. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand, and also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The code can benefit from adding docstrings for functions and classes. Docstrings provide a brief description of the function or class, which can help others understand the purpose and usage of the code.
4. Error handling:
The code can benefit from improved error handling. For example, in the `mount_volume` function, instead of catching the general `Exception` exception, it's better to catch specific exceptions like `MountException` or `ExecutionError` and handle them appropriately.
5. Code organization:
The code can benefit from better organization. For example, the `mount_volume` and `umount_volume` functions can be moved to a separate module or class, and the `validate_volume` function can be moved to a separate module or class as well. This will make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
6. Consistency in indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.
7. Use of constants:
The code can benefit from using constants for hardcoded values like the `SOURCE_PROTOCOL` and `SOURCE_TYPE` variables. This will make the code more readable and easier to maintain.
8. Use of utility functions:
The code can benefit from using utility functions for common tasks like file existence checks and directory creation. This will make the code more modular and easier to maintain.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and easy to understand. With a few improvements, it can become even more maintainable and readable.
