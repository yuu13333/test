 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent coding style:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable and function names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations sparingly. Adding more type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Function naming:
Some function names, such as `_make_var_str` and `_fail`, are not very descriptive. Renaming them to something more descriptive can improve code readability.
4. Error handling:
The code catches and handles some specific errors, such as `RFBAuthHandshakeFailed`, but not others, such as `socket.error`. It's a good practice to handle all possible errors and exceptions that can occur in the code.
5. Logging:
The code uses `logging` to log messages, but it's not configured to log errors or exceptions. Adding logging for errors and exceptions can help troubleshoot issues in the code.
6. Security considerations:
The code uses the `RFB` protocol, which is known to have security vulnerabilities. It's important to ensure that the code is using the latest version of the protocol and that all security-related configuration options are properly set. Additionally, it's a good practice to regularly review and update the code to address any newly discovered security vulnerabilities.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to follow. However, implementing the suggestions above can improve its readability, maintainability, and security.
