 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
Inconsistent naming conventions make the code harder to read and understand. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use separate words with underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
Adding type hints and annotations can make the code more readable and easier to understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future. For example, in the `NetworkMetadataProxyHandler` class, the method arguments and variables could have type hints added.
3. Docstrings:
Adding docstrings to methods and classes can help provide context and explanations for the code. This can help other developers understand the purpose and usage of the code without needing to read through the entire file.
4. Error handling:
The `cleanup_config_file` function has a try-except block that catches OSError but doesn't handle any other exceptions. It's better to catch all exceptions and log the error, rather than letting it propagate up the call stack.
5. Consistency in indentation:
The indentation in the code is inconsistent in some places. For example, in the `NetworkMetadataProxyHandler` class, the `def __init__` method has four spaces of indentation, while the other methods have six spaces. It's better to be consistent with the indentation throughout the code.
6. Unused variables:
The `state_path` variable in the `ProxyDaemon` class is never used. It's better to remove it or use it appropriately.
7. Consistency in comment style:
The code uses both triple quotes and double quotes for multiline comments. It's better to stick to a single style throughout the code.
8. Trailing commas:
Some of the method definitions have trailing commas, while others don't. It's better to be consistent with the trailing commas throughout the code.

These suggestions are minor and do not affect the security of the code. However, addressing them can make the code more maintainable and easier to read for other developers.
