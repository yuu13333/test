 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
In line 16, the import statement uses camelCase convention, while the rest of the code uses snake_case convention. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code.
2. Docstring formatting:
The docstrings in the code are not consistently formatted. Some docstrings are indented with four spaces, while others are not indented at all. It's better to use a consistent indentation of four spaces for all docstrings.
3. Missing docstrings:
Some configuration options, such as `push_gateway`, do not have docstrings. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all configuration options to provide information about their purpose and usage.
4. Use of `default` parameter:
In line 29, the `default` parameter is set to `60`, but it's not clear what unit this value represents. It's better to include a docstring that explains the unit of the `default` value.
5. Use of `min` parameter:
In line 30, the `min` parameter is set to `-1`, but it's not clear what this value represents. It's better to include a docstring that explains the purpose of the `min` parameter.
6. Use of `help` parameter:
In line 31, the `help` parameter is set to a multiline string that explains the purpose of the `collection_interval` option. However, it's not clear why this option has a multiline help string while other options do not. It's better to use a consistent format for all help strings.
7. Use of `Any other value` phrase:
In line 34, the phrase `Any other value` is used to indicate that any value other than `0` or `-1` is valid. However, it's not clear what this phrase means in the context of the `collection_interval` option. It's better to use a more descriptive phrase that explains the valid range of values for this option.
8. Use of `localhost` in `push_gateway` option:
In line 40, the `push_gateway` option is set to `localhost:9091` by default. While this is a valid value, it's not clear why this specific value was chosen. It's better to include a docstring that explains the purpose of the `push_gateway` option and why `localhost:9091` is the default value.

Overall, while there are no security defects in the code, there are some areas where the code could be improved for readability and maintainability.
