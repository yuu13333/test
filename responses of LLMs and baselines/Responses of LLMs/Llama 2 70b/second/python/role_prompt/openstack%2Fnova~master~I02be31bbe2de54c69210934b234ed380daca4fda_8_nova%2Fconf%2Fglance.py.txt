 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, there are some minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some option names use camelCase, while others use separate words with underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstring formatting:
Some docstrings are not properly formatted. For example, the docstring for the `api_insecure` option is not indented correctly. Make sure to use proper indentation and formatting for all docstrings.
3. Option names:
Some option names are not descriptive enough. For example, the `api_insecure` option could be renamed to something like `insecure_api_requests` to better convey its purpose.
4. Deprecated options:
The `deprecated` dictionary contains options that are deprecated and should be removed. However, it's not clear when these options will be removed or if they are still in use. Consider adding a comment explaining the deprecation timeline or the reason for deprecation.
5. Session configuration options:
The `ks_loading.register_session_conf_options()` function is used to register session configuration options. However, it's not clear what kind of options are being registered or why they are needed. Consider adding a comment explaining the purpose of these options.
6. Missing `default` values:
Some options lack a `default` value, which can cause issues if the option is not specified in the configuration file. Consider adding default values for these options or documenting the default behavior.
7. `list_opts()` function:
The `list_opts()` function returns a dictionary of options, but it's not clear what the purpose of this function is or how it's used. Consider adding a comment explaining the purpose of this function or refactoring it to make it more clear.

Overall, the code seems well-structured and easy to understand. However, following consistent naming conventions and improving documentation can make the code more maintainable and easier to understand for other developers.
