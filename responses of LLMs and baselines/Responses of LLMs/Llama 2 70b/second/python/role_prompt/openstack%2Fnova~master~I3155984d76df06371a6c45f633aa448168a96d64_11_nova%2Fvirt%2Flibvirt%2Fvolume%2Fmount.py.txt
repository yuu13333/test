 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have a few suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
In some places, the naming convention for variables and methods is not consistent. For example, some variables are camelCase, while others are separate words. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations sparingly. Adding more type hints and annotations can help make the code more readable and easier to understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with it in the future.
3. Docstrings:
The code has very few docstrings. Adding docstrings to methods and classes can help provide context and explain their purpose, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
4. Error handling:
The code has some try-except blocks that catch generic exceptions like `Exception` or `ProcessExecutionError`. It's better to catch specific exceptions instead, so that the error handling code is more targeted and easier to understand.
5. Consistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is not consistent. Some lines have four spaces, while others have eight. It's better to stick to a single indentation size throughout the code.
6. Unused imports:
The code has some unused imports, such as `collections` and `threading`. It's better to remove them to avoid clutter and make the code easier to read.
7. Utility functions:
Some utility functions like `utils.execute()` and `processutils.ProcessExecutionError` are used in multiple places in the code. It may be beneficial to extract these functions into a separate module or file, so that they can be reused easily and the code is more modular.
8. Comments:
The code has some comments that are not very descriptive or helpful. Adding more detailed comments or removing unnecessary ones can make the code easier to understand and maintain.

These are just suggestions for improvement and do not affect the security of the code.
