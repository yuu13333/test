 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have a few suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The code has docstrings for the policies, but they are not consistent. Some docstrings are missing descriptions, and some have incomplete or incorrect descriptions. It's important to have clear and concise docstrings for each policy to help users understand the purpose and behavior of the policy.
3. Deprecated policies:
The code has a deprecated policy (DEPRECATED_SERVICE_POLICY) that is marked as deprecated but still has an effect on the code. It's better to remove the deprecated policy and update the code to use the new policy instead.
4. Enum values:
The code uses hardcoded string values for the policy names. It's better to define these values as enum constants to make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Consistency in indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.
