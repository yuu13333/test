 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in coding style:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable and function names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions, even if they are short.
3. Error handling:
The code catches all exceptions in the `error_application` function, but it doesn't provide any specific error messages or handling for different types of exceptions. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, rather than catching all exceptions and providing a generic error message.
4. Security-related configurations:
The code uses hardcoded paths and file names for configuration files. It's better to use environment variables or configuration options to specify these paths and file names, to make the code more flexible and secure.
5. Logging:
The code uses the `logging` module for logging, but it doesn't configure logging levels or formatters. It's a good practice to configure logging levels and formatters appropriately, to ensure that log messages are useful and easy to read.
6. Service management:
The code uses the `service` module for managing services, but it doesn't use any service management tools or frameworks, such as systemd or supervisord. It's a good practice to use a service management tool or framework to manage services, to ensure that they are properly monitored and restarted if necessary.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured and easy to understand, but there are a few areas where it could be improved for better maintainability, readability, and security.
