 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent coding style:
Inconsistent coding styles make the code harder to read and understand. For example, some lines use tabs for indentation, while others use spaces. It's better to stick to a consistent style throughout the code.
2. Comments and docstrings:
Comments and docstrings help understand the code and its purpose. It's a good practice to add comments and docstrings where necessary, especially for functions and classes.
3. Type hints and annotations:
Type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors. Consider adding type hints for function parameters and return types, as well as annotations for class attributes and methods.
4. Test naming convention:
Test names should be descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention. Consider using a naming convention like "test_<test_description>" or "test_<class_name>_<method_name>".
5. Test organization:
Tests should be organized in a logical order, such as grouping related tests together. Consider organizing tests into separate modules or classes based on their functionality.
6. Test assertions:
Use assertions to verify the expected behavior of the code. Consider adding more assertions to cover different scenarios and edge cases.
7. Testing conventions:
Follow testing conventions and best practices, such as using mock objects, stubs, and fixtures to minimize dependencies and make tests more isolated and reproducible.
8. Code organization:
Consider organizing the code into smaller, more manageable functions or methods, each with a single responsibility. This can make the code easier to read and maintain.
9. Function name length:
Some function names are quite long, making them difficult to read. Consider shortening function names or breaking them up into smaller functions with descriptive names.
10. Code reuse:
Consider reusing code where possible, instead of duplicating similar code snippets. This can make the code more maintainable and reduce the risk of bugs.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and the tests cover various scenarios. Following these suggestions can make the code more maintainable, readable, and secure.
