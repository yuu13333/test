 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are not consistent. For example, some variable names are camelCase, while others are separated by underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can make the code more readable and easier to understand, and can also help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. Docstrings:
The docstrings for the functions are missing or incomplete. Adding clear and concise docstrings can help others understand the purpose and behavior of the functions, and can also make the code more maintainable.
4. Function signature:
The function signature for `select_destinations` is quite complex, with many optional parameters and return values. It may be worth considering breaking this function down into smaller functions each with a single responsibility, to make the code easier to read and understand.
5. Logging:
The logging level for the `LOG.debug` statements is quite low, which may make it difficult to diagnose issues in production. It may be worth considering using a higher logging level, such as `LOG.info` or `LOG.warning`, to make the logging more visible and useful.
6. Error handling:
The error handling in the code is minimal, with most exceptions being caught and logged at a high level. It may be worth considering adding more specific error handling and error messages, to make it easier to diagnose and resolve issues.
7. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file, which can make it difficult to navigate and maintain. It may be worth considering breaking the code up into smaller files or modules, each with a single responsibility, to make the code easier to understand and maintain.
8. Testing:
The code does not appear to include any tests or test cases. Adding tests can help ensure that the code functions correctly and can catch issues before they reach production.

I hope these suggestions are helpful in improving the code.
