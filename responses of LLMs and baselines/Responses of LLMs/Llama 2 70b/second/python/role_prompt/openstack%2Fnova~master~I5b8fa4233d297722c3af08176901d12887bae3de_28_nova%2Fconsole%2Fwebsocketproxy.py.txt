 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations sparingly. Adding more type hints and annotations can help make the code more readable and easier to understand, especially for functions and variables that are not immediately obvious.
3. Docstrings:
The code has very few docstrings. Adding docstrings to functions and classes can help provide context and explain the purpose of the code, making it easier for others to understand and maintain.
4. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have inconsistent signature formats. For example, some functions have a space between the function name and the opening parenthesis, while others do not. It's better to be consistent with the format to make the code more readable.
5. Variable naming:
Some variable names, such as `ctxt`, `token`, and `secret`, are not very descriptive. Renaming them to something more descriptive can help make the code easier to understand.
6. Function logic organization:
The `NovaProxyRequestHandler` class has a complex logic structure, with many nested if-else statements. It may be helpful to break down the logic into smaller functions or methods to make it easier to understand and maintain.
7. Exception handling:
The code has a few places where exceptions are raised without being caught. It's a good practice to catch and handle exceptions appropriately, especially in a production environment.
8. Code organization:
The code has a mix of Nova-specific code and websockify-related code. It may be helpful to separate the code into different modules or files to make it easier to manage and maintain.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and I did not find any glaring security defects. However, following best practices and coding conventions can make the code more maintainable and easier to understand for others.
