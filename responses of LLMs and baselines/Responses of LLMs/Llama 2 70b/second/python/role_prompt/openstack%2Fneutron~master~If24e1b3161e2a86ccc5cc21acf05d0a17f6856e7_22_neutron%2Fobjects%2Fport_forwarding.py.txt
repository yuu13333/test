 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints for function parameters:
Some function parameters are not typed, which can make the code harder to read and understand. Adding type hints can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
3. Use constants for magic numbers:
The code uses magic numbers in some places, such as `lib_const.IP_VERSION_4`. It's better to define constants for these values to make the code more readable and maintainable.
4. Use list comprehensions instead of itertools.groupby:
The code uses `itertools.groupby` to group rows by a specific key. List comprehensions can be used instead, which can make the code more concise and efficient.
5. Remove unused imports:
The code imports `netaddr` and `oslo_versionedobjects` but doesn't use them. These imports can be removed to simplify the code.
6. Use docstrings:
The code doesn't have docstrings for some functions and classes. Adding docstrings can help provide context and make the code easier to understand.
7. Use `None` instead of `NoneType`:
The code uses `NoneType` in some places, which is not necessary. `None` is sufficient and more concise.
8. Use `str.format()` instead of concatenation:
The code uses concatenation to create strings in some places. `str.format()` can be used instead, which can make the code more readable and avoid potential formatting issues.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. These suggestions are minor improvements that can make the code more maintainable and easier to read.
