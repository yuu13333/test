 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations sparingly. Adding more type hints and annotations can help improve code readability and make it easier for others to understand the code's intent.
3. Function docstrings:
Some functions lack docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, return types, and any other relevant information. Adding docstrings can help others understand the code's functionality and make it easier to maintain.
4. Consistent indentation:
The code uses inconsistent indentation in some places. It's better to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand.
5. Comments:
Some parts of the code have comments that are not very descriptive or are redundant. It's better to have clear and concise comments that explain the purpose of the code and help others understand what the code does.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into different functions, but some functions are quite long and complex. It may be helpful to break down some of the longer functions into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability.
7. Error handling:
The code has some places where error handling can be improved. For example, in the `docker_build` function, the code exit(-1) # terminate if docker build fail) without properly handling the error. It's better to catch specific errors and handle them appropriately.
8. Environment variables:
The code uses environment variables in some places, but it's not clear where these variables are defined. It's better to define environment variables clearly and document their purpose.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and the functionality appears to be sound. With some improvements in naming conventions, type hints, function docstrings, indentation, comments, code organization, error handling, and environment variables, the code can be even better and easier to maintain.
