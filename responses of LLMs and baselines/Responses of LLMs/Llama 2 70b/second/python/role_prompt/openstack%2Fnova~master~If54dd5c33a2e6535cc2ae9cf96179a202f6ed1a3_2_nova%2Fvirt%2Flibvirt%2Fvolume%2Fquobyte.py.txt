 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations sparingly. Adding more type hints and annotations can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors at runtime.
3. docstrings:
The code has limited docstrings, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and parameters of functions. Adding docstrings can improve code readability and help others understand the code better.
4. Function signature:
Some functions have a large number of parameters, which can make the function signature difficult to read. Consider breaking down long functions into smaller functions with fewer parameters.
5. Error handling:
The code has limited error handling. Consider adding more explicit error handling and reporting to improve the robustness of the code.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into a single file. Consider breaking down the code into smaller files or modules to improve code organization and maintainability.
7. Comments:
The code has limited comments. Adding more comments can improve code readability and help others understand the code better.
8. Code style:
The code has some inconsistencies in code style, such as inconsistent indentation and spacing. Consider using a consistent code style throughout the code.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and the author has made a good effort to follow security best practices. However, there is always room for improvement, and addressing the above suggestions can further improve the quality and security of the code.
