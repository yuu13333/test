 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code uses the `nova.tests.unit.image.fake` module, which is not a recommended practice. It's better to use a real image service instead of a fake one, especially in a test environment. This will ensure that the test is more realistic and accurate.

Additionally, the code uses the `nova.tests.unit.image.fake.stub_out_image_service` function to stub out the image service. This function is not necessary, and it's better to remove it. Instead, you can use the `nova.tests.unit.image.fake.ImageFake` class to create a fake image service that returns a fake image object. This will make the test more concise and easier to understand.

Here's an example of how you can modify the code to use a real image service and remove the unnecessary stubbing:
```python
from nova import test
from nova.tests import fixtures as nova_fixtures
from nova.tests.functional import integrated_helpers
from nova.tests.unit import cast_as_call
from nova.tests.unit.image import fake

# ... (rest of the code remains the same)

# Remove the unnecessary stubbing
self.useFixture(fake.ImageFake())

# Use a real image service instead of a fake one
image_service = self.useFixture(nova_fixtures.ImageFixture())
```
This change will make the test more realistic and accurate, and it will also simplify the code.
