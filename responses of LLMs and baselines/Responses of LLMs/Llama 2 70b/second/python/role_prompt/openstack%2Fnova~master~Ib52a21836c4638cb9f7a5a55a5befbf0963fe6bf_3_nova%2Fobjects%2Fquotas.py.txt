 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's better to add type hints and annotations for all function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's better to add docstrings for all functions, including a brief description of what the function does, its parameters, return value, and any exceptions it raises.
4. Function signature:
The `ids_from_instance` function has a complex signature with multiple optional parameters. It's better to simplify the signature by removing the unnecessary parameters and using default values for the remaining parameters.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple classes and functions, but it's not clear how they are related. It's better to organize the code into modules or packages that group related functions and classes together. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
6. Comments:
The code has limited comments, which makes it difficult to understand what the code does and how it works. It's better to add comments for each function, class, and module, describing their purpose, usage, and any notable implementation details.
7. Error handling:
The code has limited error handling, and it's not clear how errors are handled and reported. It's better to add error handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks, to handle unexpected errors and report them to the user.
8. Testing:
The code lacks testing, which makes it difficult to ensure that it works correctly. It's better to add test cases for each function and class, using a testing framework such as pytest or unittest, to ensure that the code works as expected.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but it can benefit from improvements in naming conventions, type hints, docstrings, function signature, code organization, comments, error handling, and testing.
