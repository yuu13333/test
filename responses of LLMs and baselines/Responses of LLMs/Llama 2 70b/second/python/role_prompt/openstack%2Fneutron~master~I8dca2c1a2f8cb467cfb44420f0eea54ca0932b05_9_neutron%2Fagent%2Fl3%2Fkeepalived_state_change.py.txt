 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code can benefit from adding type hints and annotations for function parameters and return types. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Docstrings:
The code can benefit from adding docstrings for functions and classes. Docstrings provide a brief description of what the function or class does, which can help others understand the code without having to read through it.
4. Separation of concerns:
The `MonitorDaemon` class has a mix of responsibilities, including reading the queue, writing the state change, and sending GARPs. It would be better to break these responsibilities into separate classes or functions to improve the code's maintainability and readability.
5. Error handling:
The code can benefit from better error handling. For example, in the `send_garp` function, there is a potential for an IP address resolution error, but the function does not handle this error gracefully. Instead, it logs an error message and continues. It's better to handle such errors more robustly, for example, by using a try-except block and logging the error details.
6. Code organization:
The code can benefit from better organization. For example, the `MonitorDaemon` class is defined at the end of the file, but it's used in the `main` function at the beginning of the file. It's better to define classes and functions in separate modules or files to improve the code's structure and readability.

Overall, the code looks well-structured, and I didn't find any glaring security defects. However, following best practices and adding improvements can make the code more maintainable, readable, and secure.
