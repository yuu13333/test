 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to mention a few best practices that could be applied to the code:

1. Consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints: The code uses type hints for some variables, but not for all. It's a good practice to add type hints for all variables to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Docstrings: The code has few docstrings, and they are not consistent. It's a good practice to add docstrings for all functions, classes, and variables to provide context and make the code easier to understand.
4. Function signature: Some functions have a large number of parameters. It's a good practice to break down such functions into smaller functions with fewer parameters to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Consistent indentation: The code has inconsistent indentation in some places. It's a good practice to use consistent indentation throughout the code to make it easier to read.
6. Comments: The code has few comments. It's a good practice to add comments to explain the purpose of the code, especially for complex logic.
7. Error handling: The code has limited error handling. It's a good practice to add error handling for unexpected scenarios to make the code more robust.
8. Security: The code uses hardcoded admin credentials for accessing OpenStack services. It's a good practice to use secure methods for storing and retrieving credentials, such as environment variables or secure storage.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, and it's good to see that it's using OpenStack's official APIs for managing resources. Following the best practices mentioned above can make the code more maintainable, readable, and secure.
