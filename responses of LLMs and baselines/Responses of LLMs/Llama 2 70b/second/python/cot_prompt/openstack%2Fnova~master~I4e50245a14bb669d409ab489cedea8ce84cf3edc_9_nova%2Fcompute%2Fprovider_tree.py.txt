 After analyzing the generated code, I did not find any security defects. The code seems to be well-structured, and the author has taken care to ensure that the code is secure.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues that could be improved:

1. Inconsistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. While this does not affect the security of the code, it can make the code harder to read and understand. It's better to stick to a single naming convention throughout the code.
2. Missing docstrings:
Some functions and classes lack docstrings that describe their purpose and parameters. Docstrings help developers understand the code and make it easier to maintain. Adding docstrings can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
3. Unused imports:
The code has some unused imports, such as `import copy`. Unused imports can make the code harder to read and can also lead to unnecessary dependencies. It's better to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and minimal.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written, and I did not find any major security defects. However, addressing the minor issues mentioned above can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Here's a summary of the issues I found:

* Inconsistent naming conventions (minor)
* Missing docstrings (minor)
* Unused imports (minor)

No security defects were detected in the code.
