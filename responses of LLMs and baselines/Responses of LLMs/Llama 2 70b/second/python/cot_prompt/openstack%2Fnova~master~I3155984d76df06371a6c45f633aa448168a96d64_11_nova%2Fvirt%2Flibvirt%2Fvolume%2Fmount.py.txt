 After analyzing the generated files, I did not detect any security defects in the code.

However, I would like to mention that the code uses the `utils.execute()` function to execute shell commands, which can be a potential security risk if the input to the function is not properly sanitized. This function takes a list of command-line arguments as its parameter, and it is possible to inject malicious input into the command by exploiting a vulnerability in the sanitization process.

For example, if an attacker were to inject a malicious command-line argument that includes a shell metacharacter, such as a backtick (``) or a semicolon (`;`), they could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system. This could lead to a variety of security issues, including data breaches, data tampering, or even system compromise.

To mitigate this risk, it is important to ensure that all user-supplied input is properly sanitized and validated before passing it to the `utils.execute()` function. This can be achieved by using a whitelist of allowed characters, rather than a blacklist of disallowed characters. Additionally, it is recommended to use the `subprocess` module instead of `utils.execute()`, as it provides better security features, such as the ability to specify the shell and the ability to capture output.

In conclusion, while I did not detect any security defects in the code, it is important to be aware of potential security risks associated with the use of shell commands and to take appropriate measures to mitigate them.
