 After analyzing the generated files, I have found a potential security defect in the code. The defect is related to the use of raw user input in the `init_application` function without proper sanitization.

The line number of the code that contains the defect is 80:
```python
self.config = config.Config()
```
The `config.Config` class takes a filename as its argument, which is user-supplied. However, the code does not sanitize the input, which could lead to a vulnerability if a malicious user provides a malicious configuration file.

The solution to this defect is to sanitize the user-supplied input by using a secure method to read the configuration file. One way to do this is to use the `configparser` module, which provides a secure way to read configuration files.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to fix this defect:
```python
import configparser

self.config = configparser.Config()
```
By using the `configparser` module, the code ensures that the configuration file is read securely and that any malicious input is sanitized.

Therefore, the security defect in the code is:

* Unsanitized user input in the `init_application` function (line 80)

The solution is to use a secure method to read the configuration file, such as the `configparser` module.
