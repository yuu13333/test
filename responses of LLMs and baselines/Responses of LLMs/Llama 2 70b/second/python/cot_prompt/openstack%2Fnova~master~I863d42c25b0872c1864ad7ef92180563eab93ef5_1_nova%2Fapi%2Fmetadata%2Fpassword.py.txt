 After analyzing the generated code, I have identified a potential security defect in the `handle_password` function.

The security defect is related to the fact that the `handle_password` function takes a raw password as input and stores it in plaintext in the `system_metadata` attribute of the instance object. This means that the password is stored in cleartext in the database, which is a security risk.

The corresponding line number of code is 71:
```
im = objects.InstanceMapping.get_by_instance_uuid(ctxt, meta_data.uuid)
```
The solution is to modify the code to store the password securely. One way to do this is to use a cryptographic hash function, such as `hashlib.sha256`, to hash the password before storing it in the database. This way, the password is stored in a secure form that is not vulnerable to plaintext attacks.

Here's an example of how the modified code could look like:
```
import hashlib

# ...

def handle_password(req, meta_data):
    # ...

    # Hash the password before storing it in the database
    password_hash = hashlib.sha256(req.body).hexdigest()

    im = objects.InstanceMapping.get_by_instance_uuid(ctxt, meta_data.uuid)
    im.system_metadata['password'] = password_hash
    im.save()
```
By modifying the code in this way, the security defect of storing the password in plaintext is mitigated, and the code is more secure.

Therefore, the final analysis is:

* Security defect: Storing password in plaintext in the database.
* Corresponding line number of code: 71.
* Solution: Hash the password before storing it in the database using a cryptographic hash function, such as `hashlib.sha256`.
