 After analyzing the generated code, I have identified a potential security defect. The defect is related to the handling of sensitive information, specifically the hardcoded API key in the 'KeepalivedStateChangeHandler' class.

Line number: 44

The issue is that the API key is hardcoded in the class, which makes it vulnerable to exposure. If an attacker gains access to the code, they can easily extract the API key and use it to access sensitive information or perform malicious actions.

Solution:

To address this issue, the API key should be stored securely, such as in an environment variable or a secure configuration file. This way, the API key is not hardcoded and is not vulnerable to exposure.

Here's an example of how the code can be modified to
