 After analyzing the generated code, I have identified a potential security defect in the `reshaper` handler.

The security defect is related to the deserialization of the request body, which is done using the `util.extract_json` function. This function uses the `json` module's `loads` method to parse the JSON data, but it does not validate the input data properly. This can lead to a vulnerability known as "JSON deserialization attack" or "JSON hijacking."

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request body that contains malicious JSON data. The `loads` method will parse the data without proper validation, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

The line number of the code that contains this vulnerability is 50:
```python
data = util.extract_json(req.body, schema.POST_RESHAPER_SCHEMA)
```
To fix this vulnerability, it's recommended to use a secure method for deserializing JSON data, such as using the `json` module's `load` method with the `strict` option enabled. This will ensure that the input data is properly validated and prevent any malicious data from being executed on the server.

Here's an example of how the code can be modified to fix this vulnerability:
```python
data = json.load(req.body, schema.POST_RESHAPER_SCHEMA, strict=True)
```
Alternatively, you can also use a third-party library like `marshmallow` or `jsonschema` to deserialize JSON data in a secure way.

In summary, the security defect in the code is related to the deserialization of the request body, which can lead to a JSON deserialization attack. The solution is to use a secure method for deserializing JSON data, such as `json.load` with the `strict` option enabled, or a third-party library like `marshmallow` or `jsonschema`.
