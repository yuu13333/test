 I have reviewed the code for security defects, and I have found one potential issue.

The issue is related to the `finish_resize` method, which is called in the `resize_and_assert_error` method. The `finish_resize` method raises a `VirtualInterfaceCreateException` in the case of a failure, but the code does not properly handle this exception.

Specifically, the code does not include a try-except block to catch the exception, and it does not properly clean up the resource provider allocations in the case of a failure. This could lead to a situation where the resource provider allocations are not properly cleaned up, which could result in a security vulnerability.

To fix this issue, I recommend adding a try-except block to the `resize_and_assert_error` method to catch the `VirtualInterfaceCreateException` and properly clean up the resource provider allocations in the case of a failure.

Here is an example of how the modified code could look:
```
def _resize_and_assert_error(self, server, dest_host):
    # ...
    try:
        self.api.post_server_action(server['id'], req)
        server = self._wait_for_state_change(self.admin_api, server, 'ERROR')
        # ...
    except VirtualInterfaceCreateException:
        # Clean up the resource provider allocations
        source_rp_uuid = self._get_provider_uuid_by_host('host1')
        dest_rp_uuid = self._get_provider_uuid_by_host('host2')
        self._delete_allocations(server['id'], source_rp_uuid)
        self._delete_allocations(server['id'], dest_rp_uuid)
        raise
```
This code adds a try-except block that catches the `VirtualInterfaceCreateException` and cleans up the resource provider allocations using the `_delete_allocations` method. The `raise` statement at the end of the except block ensures that the exception is propagated up the call stack.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
