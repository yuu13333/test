 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent coding style:
The coding style in the provided code is generally consistent. However, there are a few places where the style deviates from the rest of the code. For example, in line 131, the variable "permitted_auth_types" is assigned a list comprehension, whereas in other places, the code uses list.append() to build lists. It's better to stick to one style throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations for function parameters and return types, which is good. However, there are a few places where type hints are missing. For example, in line 142, the variable "tenant_sock" is assigned a value without a type hint. It's better to add type hints for all variables to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Function naming convention:
The naming convention for functions in the code is generally consistent. However, there are a few places where the naming convention deviates from the rest of the code. For example, in line 101, the function name "connect" is not in the format of "verb_noun" like other functions in the code. It's better to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code.
4. Comments and docstrings:
The code has good comments and docstrings that explain the purpose and behavior of the code. However, there are a few places where the comments could be improved. For example, in line 137, the comment "The server sent security types" could be more specific about what the variable "permitted_auth_types" represents. It's better to have clear and concise comments that explain the intent of the code.
5. Exception handling:
The code handles exceptions well, but there are a few places where the exception handling could be improved. For example, in line 161, the code raises an exception with a generic message that doesn't provide much information about the actual error. It's better to provide more specific error messages that indicate the root cause of the problem.
6. Consistent indentation:
The indentation in the code is generally consistent. However, there are a few places where the indentation is irregular. For example, in line 173, the indentation is inconsistent with the rest of the code. It's better to ensure consistent indentation throughout the code to make it more readable.

Overall, the code looks well-structured and follows good coding practices. However, there are a few places where the code could be improved to make it more consistent, readable, and maintainable.
