 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses some deprecated options and features, such as the 'prevent_arp_spoofing' option, which is deprecated and will be removed in the Ocata release. It is recommended to remove this option and use the port security extension instead.

Additionally, the 'of_listen_address' and 'of_listen_port' options are only used for the 'native' driver, and they are not used in the current code. It is recommended to remove these options to simplify the code.

Finally, the 'tunnel_csum' option is set to False by default, which means that the tunnel header checksum is not set on outgoing IP packets carrying GRE/VXLAN tunnels. It is recommended to set this option to True to ensure that the tunnel header checksum is properly set.

Overall, the code appears to be secure, but it could be improved by removing deprecated options and features, and by setting the 'tunnel_csum' option to True.
