 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
Inconsistent naming conventions are used throughout the code. For example, some variable names use camelCase, while others use underscores. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. It's a good practice to use type hints and annotations for all function parameters, return types, and variable declarations. This will help catch type-related errors at runtime and make the code more readable.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. It's a good practice to include docstrings for all functions, classes, and methods to provide context and documentation for other developers who may need to understand the code.
4. Function naming conventions:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are short and cryptic. It's better to use descriptive and meaningful function names to make the code more readable and easier to understand.
5. Code organization:
The code is organized into multiple classes and modules, but there is no clear separation of concerns. It's better to group related functions and classes into separate modules or classes to make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
6. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors well. For example, in the `enqueue_state_change` function, there are several places where an exception is raised without proper error handling. It's better to catch and handle exceptions appropriately to prevent the code from crashing and provide meaningful error messages.
7. Code style:
The code uses both tabs and spaces for indentation, which can make the code look inconsistent. It's better to use a consistent indentation style throughout the code.
8. Unused variables and functions:
The code has some unused variables and functions, such as `LOG` and `utils`. It's better to remove them to avoid confusion and make the code more concise.

Overall, the code seems to be well-structured, but there are some areas where it can be improved for readability, maintainability, and security.
