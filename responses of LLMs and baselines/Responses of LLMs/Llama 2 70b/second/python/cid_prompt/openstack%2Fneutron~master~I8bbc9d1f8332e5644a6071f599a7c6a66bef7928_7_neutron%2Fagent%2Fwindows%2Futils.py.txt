 I have reviewed the code and found a few potential security defects:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
In the `create_process` function, the `addl_env` parameter is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious environment variables that could lead to code execution or other security issues. It's recommended to validate and sanitize the `addl_env` parameter to ensure it only contains expected environment variables.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
In the `avoid_blocking_call` function, the `f` parameter is not properly validated. An attacker could potentially pass a malicious function that could lead to code execution or other security issues. It's recommended to validate the `f` parameter to ensure it's a valid function that doesn't pose a security risk.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
In the `execute` function, the `obj` variable is not properly cleaned up after use. Specifically, the `obj.stdin` and `obj.stdout` streams are not properly closed. This could lead to resource leaks and potential security issues. It's recommended to properly close these streams after use.
4. CWE-691 (Incorrect Calculation):
In the `get_root_helper_child_pid` function, the `pid` parameter is not properly validated. An attacker could potentially pass a malicious value that could lead to an incorrect calculation of the child process ID. It's recommended to validate the `pid` parameter to ensure it's a valid process ID.
5. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
In the `process_is_running` function, the `tasklist` command is used to check if a process is running. However, this command can be disabled or tampered with by an attacker, leading to a false sense of security. It's recommended to use a more reliable method to check if a process is running, such as using the `psutil` library.
6. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
In the `pid_invoked_with_cmdline` function, the `expected_cmd` parameter is not properly validated. An attacker could potentially pass a malicious command that could lead to an incorrect comparison. It's recommended to validate the `expected_cmd` parameter to ensure it's a valid command that doesn't pose a security risk.

Solution:

1. Sanitize the `addl_env` parameter in the `create_process` function to ensure it only contains expected environment variables.
2. Validate the `f` parameter in the `avoid_blocking_call` function to ensure it's a valid function that doesn't pose a security risk.
3. Properly close the `obj.stdin` and `obj.stdout` streams in the `execute` function to prevent resource leaks and potential security issues.
4. Validate the `pid` parameter in the `get_root_helper_child_pid` function to ensure it's a valid process ID.
5. Use a more reliable method to check if a process is running, such as using the `psutil` library, in the `process_is_running` function.
6. Validate the `expected_cmd` parameter in the `pid_invoked_with_cmdline` function to ensure it's a valid command that doesn't pose a security risk.
