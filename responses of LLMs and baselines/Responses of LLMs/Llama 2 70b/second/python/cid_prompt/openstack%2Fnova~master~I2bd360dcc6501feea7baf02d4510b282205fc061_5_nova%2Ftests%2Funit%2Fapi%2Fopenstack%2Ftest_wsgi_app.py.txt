 I have reviewed the code and found a security defect. The defect is related to improper access control and falls under the category of CWE-284.

The issue is that the `wsgi_app.init_application()` function is not properly checking whether the global data has already been initialized before attempting to initialize it again. This can lead to a situation where the function tries to initialize the global data multiple times, which can cause unexpected behavior and potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

The line numbers associated with this defect are 69-70, 77-78, and 85-86.

To fix this defect, the `wsgi_app.init_application()` function should be modified to properly check whether the global data has already been initialized before attempting to initialize it again. One way to do this is to add a flag that indicates whether the global data has already been initialized, and check this flag before attempting to initialize the data again.

Here's an example of how the modified function could look like:
```
def init_application(self, name):
    if self._global_data_initialized:
        return
    self._global_data_initialized = True
    # rest of the function
```
By adding this simple check, the function will not attempt to initialize the global data multiple times, which will prevent potential security vulnerabilities and improve the overall security of the application.
