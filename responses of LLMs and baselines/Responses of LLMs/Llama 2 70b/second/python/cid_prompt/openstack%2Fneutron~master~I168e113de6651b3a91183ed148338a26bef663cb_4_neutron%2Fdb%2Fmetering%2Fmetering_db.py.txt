 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistent naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for readability and maintainability.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The function parameters and return types are not consistently annotated. Adding type hints and annotations can help catch type-related errors and make the code more readable.
3. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage. Adding docstrings can help provide context and make the code more understandable.
4. Function signature consistency:
Some functions have redundant or mismatched parameter lists. For example, the `create_metering_label` function takes a `context` parameter, but the `get_metering_label` function takes a `context` and a `label_id` parameter. It's better to make the function signatures consistent throughout the code.
5. Function logic organization:
The code has some long functions with complex logic. It's better to break down the logic into smaller functions to make the code more readable and maintainable.
6. Error handling:
The code catches some exceptions but doesn't handle them properly. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, such as logging the error and returning a specific error message to the user.
7. Consistent indentation:
The code has inconsistent indentation
