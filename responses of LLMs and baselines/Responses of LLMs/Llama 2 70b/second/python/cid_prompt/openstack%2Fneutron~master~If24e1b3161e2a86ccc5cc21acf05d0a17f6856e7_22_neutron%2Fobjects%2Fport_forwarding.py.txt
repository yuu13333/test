 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out a few things that could be improved:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The code uses both camelCase and snake_case naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code for consistency and readability.
2. Docstrings:
The code lacks docstrings for many methods and classes. Docstrings help in understanding the purpose and parameters of a method or class, and should be included for all public methods and classes.
3. Type hints:
The code uses type hints for some method parameters and return types, but not for all. It's a good practice to include type hints for all method parameters and return types to make the code more readable and maintainable.
4. Constant naming:
The code defines some constants using the `lib_const` module, but some constants are defined as magic numbers in the code. It's better to define all constants in a single place, such as a `constants` module, to make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. Method naming:
Some method names are quite long and descriptive, while others are short and not very descriptive. It's better to use descriptive names for all methods to make the code more readable.
6. Code organization:
The code is organized into different sections, but some sections are quite long and contain multiple, unrelated methods. It's better to break down long sections into smaller, more focused sections to make the code more readable and maintainable.
7. Error handling:
The code doesn't handle errors very well. It's better to include try-except blocks and handle errors appropriately, rather than just raising generic exceptions.
8. Code style:
The code uses both tabs and spaces for indentation, which can make the code look inconsistent. It's better to use a single indentation style throughout the code.

These are just some suggestions for improving the code quality. The code appears to be secure, but following best practices for code quality can make it easier to maintain and understand over time.
