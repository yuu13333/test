 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code uses the 'quota' module, which is not a standard Python module. It is imported from the 'nova' package, but it is not clear where it is defined. It would be better to use a standard Python module or a module that is widely used and well-documented, such as 'sqlalchemy' or 'pandas'. Additionally, some of the function names are quite long and complex, making the code difficult to read. It would be better to use shorter and more descriptive function names to improve readability.
