 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to point out that the code is quite complex, and it's challenging to identify potential security vulnerabilities without a thorough review of the entire codebase. The code appears to be well-structured, and it's great to see that it includes a thorough set of unit tests.

I would recommend performing a security assessment of the code, including a manual review of the code, to identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses. Additionally, it's essential to ensure that the code is designed with security in mind, following best practices and guidelines for secure coding.

If you have any specific concerns or questions regarding the security of the code, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help.
