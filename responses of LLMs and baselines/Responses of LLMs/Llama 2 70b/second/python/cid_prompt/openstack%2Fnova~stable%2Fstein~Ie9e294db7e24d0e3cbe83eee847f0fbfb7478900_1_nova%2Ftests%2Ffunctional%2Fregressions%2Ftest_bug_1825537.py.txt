 I have reviewed the code for security defects, and I have found one potential issue:

1. CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation

The issue is related to the calculation of resource provider allocations in the `test_finish_resize_fails_allocation_cleanup` method. Specifically, the `self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation` method is called twice, once with the `dest_rp_uuid` and once with the `source_rp_uuid`. However, the `dest_rp_uuid` is not being used in the second call to `self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation`, which could lead to incorrect results.

The line numbers associated with this issue are 75 and 81.

To fix this issue, you can modify the code to use the `dest_rp_uuid` in the second call to `self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation`, like this:
```
self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation(
    self.flavor2, server['id'], dest_rp_uuid)
```
Alternatively, you can remove the second call to `self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation` altogether, as it seems to be redundant.

I did not find any other security defects in the code.
