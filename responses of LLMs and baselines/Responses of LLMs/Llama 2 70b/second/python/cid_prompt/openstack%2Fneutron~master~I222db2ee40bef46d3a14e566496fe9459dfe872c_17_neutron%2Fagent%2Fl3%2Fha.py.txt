 No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvements:

1. Consistency in naming conventions:
The naming conventions in the code are generally consistent. However, there are a few inconsistencies, such as the use of both camelCase and snake_case for variable names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code.
2. Type hints and annotations:
The code uses type hints and annotations inconsistently. Some functions and variables have type hints, while others don't. It's better to add type hints and annotations for all functions and variables to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Function naming conventions:
Some function names are quite long and descriptive, while others are shorter and less descriptive. It's better to use descriptive names for all functions to make the code easier to understand.
4. Function logic organization:
Some functions, such as the `enqueue_state_change` function, have multiple logical branches that could be separated into smaller functions. This would make the code easier to read and maintain.
5. Consistency in exception handling:
The code uses try-except blocks inconsistently. Some functions have try-except blocks, while others don't. It's better to use try-except blocks consistently throughout the code to handle exceptions properly.
6. Use of constants:
The code uses hardcoded values in some places, such as the `KEEPALIVED_STATE_CHANGE_SERVER_BACKLOG` constant. It's better to define these constants separately in a dedicated constants file to make the code more maintainable.
7. Use of logging:
The code uses the `logging` module inconsistently. Some functions use the `logging` module to log messages, while others don't. It's better to use the `logging` module consistently throughout the code to log important messages.
8. Use of `timeutils` module:
The code uses the `timeutils` module to calculate timestamps. However, the `timeutils` module is not imported in some places where it's used. It's better to import the `timeutils` module consistently throughout the code.
9. Use of `eventlet` module:
The code uses the `eventlet` module to spawn greenlets. However, the `eventlet` module is not imported in some places where it's used. It's better to import the `eventlet` module consistently throughout the code.
10. Code organization:
The code is organized into separate classes and functions, which is good. However, some functions are quite long and complex, which can make the code harder to read and maintain. It's better to break down long functions into smaller functions to make the code more readable and maintainable.

Overall, the code looks well-organized, and I don't see any major security issues. However, following the above suggestions can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and security.
