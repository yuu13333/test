# FIXME(mriedem): This is bug 1825537 where the allocations are reverted when finish_resize fails so the dest node resource provider does not have any allocations and the instance allocations are for the old flavor on the source node resource provider even though the instance is not running on the source host nor pointed at the source host in the DB.
# self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation(
#     self.flavor2, server['id'], dest_rp_uuid)



SECURITY DEFECT:

The commented out assertion method self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation() on lines
75-76 represents a security defect. The defect arises from a bug (identified as
bug 1825537) where allocations are reverted when a finish resize operation
fails, leading to incorrect allocation of resources. This can potentially result
in resource over-allocation or under-allocation, which can be exploited for
various purposes including denial-of-service attacks or unauthorized resource
usage.


SOLUTION:

To fix this security defect, the code should be updated to properly handle
resource allocation in cases where the finish resize operation fails. This would
involve ensuring that resource allocations are consistent and accurate even in
failure scenarios. Depending on the specifics of the bug and system
requirements, this may involve adjusting the allocation logic or implementing
proper error handling mechanisms.

Additionally, it's important to remove or address the commented-out code
properly. If it's left in the codebase, it can lead to confusion and potential
oversight during code maintenance. If the assertion is meant to be temporarily
disabled due to the bug, a comment explaining why it's disabled and any related
issues or bug tracking numbers should be included.

The comment should be updated with more details about the bug, potential
impacts, and any ongoing efforts to address it. If possible, provide a reference
or link to the bug tracking system for developers to follow up on the issue.
