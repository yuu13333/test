# Security Defect Detected

# Line 49-50:
# The API microversion is set globally to '2.11' which may affect other tests that rely on different microversions.
# Setting the microversion globally might not be isolated and could potentially affect other tests negatively.
# This could lead to unpredictable behavior and inconsistent test results.

# Line 83:
# The use of time.sleep() for a fixed duration (0.5 seconds) to simulate a delay in the rebuild process can lead to race conditions and non-deterministic behavior.
# Relying on fixed time intervals in testing can be unreliable, especially if the performance of the system changes.
# Additionally, this could significantly slow down the execution of the test suite.

# Line 119-122:
# The force_down_service() method is used to force a compute service down without authentication checks.
# This could pose a security risk if not properly restricted as it allows a user to forcefully shut down compute services without proper authorization.
# It's important to ensure that only authorized users have the privilege to force services down.

# Line 62-69:
# The start_service() method is used to start multiple compute services, but it doesn't handle errors or exceptions that might occur during service startup.
# If any of these services fail to start, it could lead to an incomplete test environment or unexpected behavior during testing.

# Line 134-141:
# The test waits for the server to reach a specific state using time-based polling.
# This approach can lead to inefficient resource usage and increases the test execution time.
# Using polling for state verification can also introduce timing-related issues and make tests flaky.

# Solution:
# - Instead of setting the API microversion globally, set it only for the specific API calls where it's needed.
# - Use more robust methods for simulating delays in tests, such as mocking or stubbing out the relevant components.
# - Ensure that the force_down_service() method is restricted to authorized users or roles.
# - Implement error handling for service startup to handle failures gracefully.
# - Replace time-based polling with event-based mechanisms or asynchronous notifications for state verification.
