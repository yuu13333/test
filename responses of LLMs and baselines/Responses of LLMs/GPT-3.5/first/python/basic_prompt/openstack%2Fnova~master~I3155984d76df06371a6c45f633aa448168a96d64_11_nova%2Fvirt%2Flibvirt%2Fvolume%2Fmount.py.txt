# 1. Missing Exception Handling:
#    When an error occurs during the execution of the mount command in the `mount` method,
#    the code raises a generic Exception, catching all types of exceptions. This can hide
#    specific errors and make it harder to diagnose issues.
#    Line: 121
#    Solution: Catch specific exceptions such as subprocess.CalledProcessError or OSError
#              to handle errors more precisely.

# 2. Race Condition in Instance Initialization:
#    There is a race condition in the `get` method where multiple threads may concurrently
#    initialize the MountManager instance, potentially causing inconsistency or issues.
#    Line: 77, 78
#    Solution: Use a double-checked locking pattern or another form of synchronization
#              to ensure thread safety during instance initialization.

# 3. Inconsistent Handling of Mount State:
#    In the `umount` method, the variable `self.mounted` is referenced but not defined
#    in the `MountManager` class. This could lead to inconsistent handling of mount states.
#    Line: 150
#    Solution: Define `self.mounted` properly or remove the reference if not needed.

# 4. Insecure File Handling:
#    In the `mount` method, the `utils.execute` function is used without proper input
#    validation or sanitization, which could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
#    Line: 122
#    Solution: Validate and sanitize input parameters before passing them to `utils.execute`.
