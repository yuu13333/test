162 # The `exc_info` passed to `add_instance_fault_from_exc` is using `sys.exc_info()`, which may contain sensitive information.
163 # It's recommended to pass `None` instead to prevent leaking sensitive information.
# Replace:
# exc_info=sys.exc_info()
# with:
# exc_info=None

197 # The comparison `if time.time() > expiration` can cause a timing attack.
198 # Instead of comparing time directly, use a constant time comparison function such as `time_constant_cmp`.
# Example:
# Replace:
# if time.time() > expiration:
# with:
# if time_constant_cmp(time.time(), expiration):
