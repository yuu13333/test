SECURITY DEFECT:

In the delete method, there's a potential information disclosure vulnerability.
When a user attempts to delete a server group that doesn't exist, the code
raises a webob.exc.HTTPNotFound exception with the error message directly from
the exception caught (e.format_message()). This might expose sensitive
information about the server group existence, which can aid attackers in
reconnaissance.


SOLUTION:

Handle the HTTPNotFound exception without leaking specific error messages.
Instead, return a generic error message without revealing whether the server
group exists or not.

python
Copy code
91         except nova.exception.InstanceGroupNotFound:
92             raise webob.exc.HTTPNotFound(explanation="Server group not found.")


python
Copy code
138         except ValueError:
139             raise exc.HTTPBadRequest(explanation="Invalid request data.")


python
Copy code
126             raise exc.HTTPForbidden(explanation="Quota exceeded, too many server groups.")


No security defects are detected in the code.
