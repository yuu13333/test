The code provided does not contain any obvious security defects related to the
specified CWEs. However, there are some improvements that could enhance the
security and readability of the code:

 1. Line 14: The import statement from nova.policies import base should be
    followed by a blank line for better readability.

 2. Line 20: The BASE_POLICY_NAME variable should be defined as a constant at
    the beginning of the file for better organization and readability.

 3. Line 34: In the BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'host_info:index' line, the string
    'host_info:index' should be replaced with a more descriptive name to avoid
    confusion and potential issues in the future.

 4. Line 44: The list_rules function could be documented to explain its purpose
    and return value.

 5. Overall: It's important to ensure that the policies defined in the
    server_topology_policies list are accurate and aligned with the intended
    security policy. Consider reviewing and verifying these policies against the
    actual security requirements.

No security defects are detected in the code, but the above suggestions could
improve its quality and maintainability.
