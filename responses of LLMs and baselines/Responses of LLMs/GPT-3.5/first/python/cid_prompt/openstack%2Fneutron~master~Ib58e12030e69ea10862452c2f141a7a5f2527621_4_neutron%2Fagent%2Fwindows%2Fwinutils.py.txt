There are no apparent security defects related to the provided CWEs in the code
you shared. However, there are a few general improvements that could be made:

 1. Error Handling: Ensure that all errors are caught and handled appropriately.
    This includes errors raised by system calls and functions, as well as errors
    that might occur during file or pipe operations.

 2. Resource Management: Ensure that all resources, such as file handles and
    pipe handles, are properly managed and closed when they are no longer
    needed. This helps prevent resource leaks.

 3. Input Sanitization: If the command line passed to _start_process can be
    influenced by user input, ensure that it is properly sanitized to prevent
    command injection attacks.

 4. Use of Constants: Instead of hardcoding values like win32event.INFINITE,
    consider using constants or variables to make the code more readable and
    maintainable.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for
Windows programming. However, it's important to thoroughly test the code in
different scenarios to ensure its correctness and security.
