The code provided seems to be a unit test for policy enforcement related to
changing the admin password in a Nova API. Let's review the code for security
defects:

 1. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
    
    * Line 39: The self.mock_get.return_value is setting the return value for
      nova.api.openstack.common.get_instance. Ensure that this mocking is
      consistent with the behavior of the actual get_instance method to prevent
      incorrect behavior during testing.

 2. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
    
    * Line 39: The mocking setup (self.mock_get.return_value) might not handle
      exceptional conditions properly. Ensure that the mocking considers edge
      cases and exceptions to prevent unexpected behavior during testing.

Apart from these points, the code seems structured and focused on unit testing
the policy enforcement, which is a good practice.

No security defects are detected in the code.
