Here are some security defects found in the original code along with their
descriptions and solutions:

 1. Line 202: Insecure Regular Expression (Regex DoS)
    
    * Description: The regular expression used in line 202 match =
      re.match(r"^([1-9]\d*)\.([1-9]\d*0)$", version_string) is susceptible to a
      Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. An attacker could
      craft a malicious input that causes the regex engine to enter a state of
      exponential backtracking, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
    * Solution: Use a more efficient and secure regex pattern that avoids
      exponential backtracking. For example, match = re.match(r"^\d+\.\d+$",
      version_string).

 2. Line 254: Missing Input Validation
    
    * Description: The APIVersionRequest class constructor in line 254 does not
      validate the input version_string thoroughly. It assumes that the input is
      always in the format "X.Y" where X and Y are integers, leading to
      potential issues if the input format is different.
    * Solution: Add input validation to ensure that the version_string matches
      the expected format before processing it. For instance, check if the input
      string contains only digits and a dot in between.

 3. Line 306: Hard-Coded Secret
    
    * Description: There is a hard-coded secret in the comment at line 306
      ("@param max_version: Maximum acceptable version."). Hard-coded secrets
      pose a security risk as they can be exposed inadvertently in version
      control systems or through code sharing.
    * Solution: Remove the hard-coded secret from the comment and store
      sensitive information securely, such as using environment variables or
      configuration files.

 4. Line 329: Unhandled Exception
    
    * Description: The get_string method
