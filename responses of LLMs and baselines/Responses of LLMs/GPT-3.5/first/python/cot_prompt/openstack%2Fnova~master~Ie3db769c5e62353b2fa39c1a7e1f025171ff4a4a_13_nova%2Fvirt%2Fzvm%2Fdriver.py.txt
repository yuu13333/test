The original code appears to have some potential security issues:

 1. Code Injection Vulnerability:
    
    * Line 220: In the _get_image_info method, the image_meta_id variable is
      directly used in a call to self._reqh.call('image_query',
      imagename=image_meta_id). If the image_meta_id variable is controlled by
      user input, it could lead to a code injection vulnerability.
    * Solution: Ensure that user-controlled input is properly sanitized or
      validated before being used in dynamic function calls like this.
      Preferably, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent
      code injection attacks.

 2. Command Injection Vulnerability:
    
    * Line 332: In the _import_spawn_image method, the image_url variable is
      constructed by concatenating the string "file://" with the image_path
      variable. If the image_path contains user-controlled input, it could be
      exploited to perform arbitrary command execution.
    * Solution: Instead of constructing the image_url string using string
      concatenation, consider using a safer method such as os.path.join to
      concatenate the file path components securely. Additionally, validate and
      sanitize user-controll
