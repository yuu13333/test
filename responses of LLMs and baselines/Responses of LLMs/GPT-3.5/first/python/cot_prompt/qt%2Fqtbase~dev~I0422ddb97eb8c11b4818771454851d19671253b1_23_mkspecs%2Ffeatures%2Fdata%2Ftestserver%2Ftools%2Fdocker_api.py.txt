Upon reviewing the original code, no immediate security defects are evident.
However, there are some practices that could be improved for security and
robustness:

 1. Using os.environ.has_key(): Line 99 uses os.environ.has_key() to check for
    the existence of a key in the environment. This function is deprecated and
    not recommended. Instead, it's better to use os.environ.get() or directly
    access the environment dictionary.

 2. Potential Command Injection: The check_call() function (line 197) is
    susceptible to command injection if the script variable contains
    user-controlled input. To mitigate this, it's crucial to properly sanitize
    or validate the input before passing it to the command execution function.

 3. Error Handling: While the script does handle errors and exits upon failure
    during Docker operations, it doesn't provide detailed error messages or
    logging, which could make troubleshooting difficult.

 4. Hardcoded Secrets: There might be hardcoded secrets or sensitive information
    in the Docker configuration files (e.g., passwords, API keys). It's crucial
    to avoid hardcoding such information and consider using environment
    variables or dedicated secret management solutions.

 5. Dependency Vulnerabilities: The Docker images used in the script might
    contain vulnerabilities due to outdated or insecure dependencies. Regularly
    updating Docker images and scanning for vulnerabilities can help mitigate
    this risk.

 6. Potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) Vulnerability: If the script is accessible
    to untrusted users, they might abuse the Docker operations to consume
    excessive resources, leading to a DoS condition. Access controls and rate
    limiting should be enfo
