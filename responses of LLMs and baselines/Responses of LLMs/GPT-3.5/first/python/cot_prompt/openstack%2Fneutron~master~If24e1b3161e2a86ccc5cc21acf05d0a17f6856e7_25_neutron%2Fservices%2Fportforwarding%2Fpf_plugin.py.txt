Here are some potential security issues in the original code:

 1. SQL Injection in create_floatingip_port_forwarding: In the
    create_floatingip_port_forwarding method, there is a potential SQL injection
    vulnerability when constructing the message for
    NeutronDbObjectDuplicateEntry exception. The conflict_params variable is
    directly interpolated into the error message without proper sanitization or
    parameter binding.
    
    * Line: 165
    * Issue: Direct string interpolation without proper sanitation.
    * Solution: Use parameterized queries or sanitize the conflict_params before
      interpolating into the error message.

 2. Potential SQL Injection in try_find_exist: The try_find_exist method
    constructs a list of parameters for querying the database. Depending on how
    these parameters are generated, there might be a risk of SQL injection if
    user input is not properly sanitized.
    
    * Line: 238
    * Issue: Depending on how specify_params is generated, it might lead to SQL
      injection.
    * Solution: Ensure that all parameters used in database queries are properly
      sanitized or use parameterized queries.

 3. Missing Input Validation in update_floatingip_port_forwarding: In the
    update_floatingip_port_forwarding method, there is a lack of input
    validation for the internal_port_id parameter. If the parameter is not
    validated properly, it might lead to unexpected behavior or security
    vulnerabilities.
    
    * Line: 177
    * Issue: Lack of input validation for internal_port_id
