Here are some potential security defects in the original code along with their
corresponding line numbers and solutions:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability (Line 184, Line 234):
    
    * Issue: The host_agent.version and host_agent.agent_update methods are
      being called using subprocess execution without proper validation or
      sanitization of input. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities
      if untrusted input is passed to these methods.
    * Solution: Use parameterized subprocess calls or validate and sanitize
      input to prevent command injection attacks. For example, instead of
      directly passing args to execute in host_agent.version, validate and
      sanitize the args before passing it to subprocess execution.

 2. Weak Key Generation (Line 401-419):
    
    * Issue: The SimpleDH class uses a fixed prime number (_prime) and base
      (_base) for Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which can weaken the security of
      the key generation process.
    * Solution: Use a strong and randomly generated prime number and base for
      Diffie-Hellman key exchange to improve security. Consider using libraries
      like cryptography to handle key generation securely.
