Here's an analysis of potential security defects in the original code:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability: The execute() function in line 113 allows
    for the execution of arbitrary commands. However, it does not properly
    sanitize or validate the input, making it vulnerable to command injection
    attacks.
    
    * Line: 113
    * Description: Attackers could inject malicious commands via user-controlled
      input, leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or system compromise.
    * Solution: To mitigate this vulnerability, it's essential to use proper
      input validation and sanitization techniques. Preferably, use library
      functions that handle command execution securely or employ mechanisms like
      whitelisting acceptable inputs.

 2. Insecure File Operations: The remove_conf_files() function in lines 269-272
    deletes files based on a wildcard pattern without proper validation. This
    can lead to unintended file deletion or path traversal attacks.
    
    * Lines: 269-272
    * Description: Attackers could manipulate the wildcard pattern to delete
      unintended files or directories. Additionally, improper validation may
      allow for path traversal attacks, enabling attackers to delete arbitrary
      files on the system.
    * Solution: Use a more secure method for deleting files, such as specifying
      the exact file path to be deleted and performing proper input validation
      to prevent path traversal attacks. Alternatively, implement file deletion
      functionality with appropriate permissions and access controls.

 3. Information Disclosure: The execute() function in lines 113-157 logs command
    execution details, including command arguments, stdout, stderr, and return
    codes, without ensuring sensitive information is
