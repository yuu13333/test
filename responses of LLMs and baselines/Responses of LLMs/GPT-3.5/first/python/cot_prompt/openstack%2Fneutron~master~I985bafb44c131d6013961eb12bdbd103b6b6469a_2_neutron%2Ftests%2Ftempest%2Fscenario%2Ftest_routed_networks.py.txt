Upon analyzing the original code, I've identified a potential security concern
related to the _ssh_check method. Here's the detailed analysis:


SECURITY CONCERN:

In the _ssh_check method (lines 111-136), the private key is written to a
temporary file (key_file_path) without proper permissions, and this file is not
securely handled. This could potentially expose sensitive information if an
attacker gains access to the system.


LINE NUMBER:

python
Copy code
124         with open(key_file_path, "w") as private_key_file:
125             private_key_file.write(private_key)



SOLUTION:

To mitigate this security concern, the following steps can be taken:

 1. Use Secure File Handling: Instead of writing the private key to a file, use
    secure methods such as storing it in memory or using secure key storage
    mechanisms provided by the platform.
 2. Ensure Proper File Permissions: If writing to a file is unavoidable, ensure
    that proper file permissions are set to restrict access only to authorized
    users.
 3. Securely Remove Temporary Files: After use, securely delete the temporary
    file to prevent lingering sensitive information.


EXAMPLE SOLUTION:

python
Copy code
import os

# Inside _ssh_check method
with open(key_file_path, "wb") as private_key_file:
    os.chmod(key_file_path, 0o600)  # Set proper permissions
    private_key_file.write(private_key)

# After subprocess call
os.remove(key_file_path)  # Securely delete the temporary file


By implementing these measures, the potential security risk associated with
exposing sensitive information through temporary file
