Here's an analysis of the original code for security defects:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability:
    
    * Line 122: In the run_proxy() method, the which command is executed without
      proper validation or sanitization of input. This could potentially lead to
      command injection if the input is manipulated.
    * Solution: Use absolute path to haproxy binary instead of relying on system
      which command. Alternatively, validate and sanitize input before passing
      it to execute() function.

 2. File Path Manipulation:
    
    * Line 114: When creating the configuration directory cfg_dir, there's no
      check for directory traversal or manipulation. An attacker could
      potentially manipulate the cfg_dir variable to create or access files in
      unintended directories.
    * Solution: Validate and sanitize the input used to construct the directory
      path. Ensure that it points to a directory where the application has
      permissions to read and write.

 3. Insecure File Permissions:
    
    * Line 116: When creating the haproxy configuration file, there's no
      explicit setting of file permissions. Depending on the umask settings, the
      file may have insecure permissions.
    * Solution: Set appropriate file permissions explicitly after creating the
      file, ensuring that it is readable and writable only by authorized users.

 4. Privilege Escalation:
    
    * Line 71, 72: The user and group variables are set to the effective UID and
      GID respectively if they are not provided. This could potentially lead to
      privilege escalation if the scr
