The original code appears to be well-structured and follows standard practices
for network interface management. However, there are a few potential security
considerations and best practices that could be improved upon:

 1. Input Validation for Device Name (line 268, 276):
    
    * Security Defect: The device_name parameter passed to methods like plug and
      unplug is assumed to be a valid device name without explicit input
      validation. This could potentially lead to command injection or unexpected
      behavior if malicious input is provided.
    * Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the device_name
      parameter only contains allowed characters and does not allow special
      characters or commands that could be used for injection attacks.

 2. Potential Command Injection (line 454, 459):
    
    * Security Defect: The device.link.delete() method in the unplug method
      could potentially be vulnerable to command injection if the device_name
      parameter is not properly sanitized.
    * Solution: Sanitize the device_name parameter by ensuring it only contains
      allowed characters and does not allow shell metacharacters or commands.

 3. Logging of Sensitive Information (line 270, 390):
    
    * Security Defect: The code logs warnings about missing MTU configurations
      (No MTU configured for port %s) without considering whether the port ID or
      other sensitive information is logged along with the warning.
    * Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information such as port IDs or MAC
      addresses in log messages. If logging is necessary for debugging purposes,
      ensure that sensitive information is redacted or obfuscated in the log
      messages.

 4. Error Handling for Runtime Errors (line 370, 411):
    
    * Security Defect: The code uses a generic except RuntimeError clause
      without specific error handling or logging for runtime errors. This could
      make it difficult to diagnose and troubleshoot issues, especially in
      production environments.
    * Solution: Implement specific error handling and logging for different
      types of runtime errors to provide better visibility into potential issues
      and improve debugging capabilities.

 5. Privilege Escalation (line 349, 450):
    
    * Security Defect: The code creates network interfaces and sets them up
      without considering potential privilege escalation risks, especially if
