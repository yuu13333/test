The original code seems generally secure, but there are a couple of areas that
could be improved for better security:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability: In Python, executing commands via
    os.system() or subprocess.call() can lead to command injection
    vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized. In the original
    code, this is not directly evident. However, line 51 (execute =
    utils.execute) suggests that the execute function might be used for
    executing system commands. If utils.execute internally uses os.system() or
    similar functions without proper input validation, it could lead to command
    injection vulnerabilities.
    
    Solution: Ensure that any user input passed to system commands is properly
    validated and sanitized to prevent command injection attacks. Prefer using
    safer alternatives like subprocess.Popen with the shell=False argument or
    specific libraries designed for command execution with input sanitization.

 2. Exception Handling: The code lacks comprehensive exception handling. For
    example, in the load_interface_driver function (lines 118-131), if an
    ImportError occurs while loading the interface driver, the code simply logs
    the error and exits with SystemExit(1). This behavior might not be ideal,
    especially in critical applications where graceful degradation or fallback
    mechanisms are necessary.
    
    Solution: Implement robust exception handling throughout the codebase,
    considering potential failure scenarios and appropriate error handling
    mechanisms. Instead of abruptly exiting the program, handle exceptions
    gracefully, log meaningful error messages, and ensure that the application
    can recover or degrade gracefully under failure conditions.

By addressing these issues, the code can be made more secure and resilient to
potential security threats and failure scenarios.
