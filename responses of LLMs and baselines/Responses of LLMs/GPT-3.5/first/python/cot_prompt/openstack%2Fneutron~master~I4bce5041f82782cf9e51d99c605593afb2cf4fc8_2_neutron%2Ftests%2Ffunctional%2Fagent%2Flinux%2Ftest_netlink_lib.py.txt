The original code appears to be primarily focused on functional testing and
manipulation of conntrack entries using the netlink-lib library. Upon review, I
haven't identified any immediate security defects in the provided code. However,
there are a few points worth considering to ensure security best practices:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability: The code uses linux_utils.execute() to
    execute system commands, passing them as arguments directly. This could
    potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if unsanitized user
    input is passed as arguments. While the code does not seem to accept user
    input in this context, it's important to ensure that any user-controlled
    input is properly validated and sanitized before passing it to
    linux_utils.execute() to prevent command injection attacks.
    
    Line numbers: 50-54, 72-75
    
    Solution: Always validate and sanitize user input before constructing system
    commands. Prefer using higher-level APIs or libraries that abstract away the
    need for direct system command execution whenever possible.

 2. Error Handling: The code catches RuntimeError exceptions but raises a
    generic Exception with the message 'Error while creating entry'. This lack
    of specific error handling could make it challenging to diagnose and
    troubleshoot issues, especially in a production environment.
    
    Line numbers: 55, 76
    
    Solution: Implement more granular error handling to provide meaningful error
    messages and appropriate actions based on the specific error encountered.

 3. Input Validation: While the code does validate the zone ID against a maximum
    value, it does not perform input validation to ensure that zone IDs are
    within a valid range. If an invalid zone ID is provided, it could
    potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
    
    Line numbers: 67-68
    
    Solution: Implement additional input validation to ensure that zone IDs
    provided to functions are within a valid range and adhere to any specific
    requirements.

Overall, the code seems well-structured and focused on its intended
functionality. However, ensuring robust input validation, error handling, and
