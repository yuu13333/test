Upon reviewing the original code, here are potential security defects and their
corresponding analysis:

 1. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):
    
    * Location: Line 128
    * Description: The show method retrieves server group information based on
      the provided id parameter without verifying whether the user has the
      appropriate permissions to access that particular server group. This could
      lead to an IDOR vulnerability, allowing unauthorized users to access
      sensitive server group data.
    * Solution: Before retrieving the server group information, ensure that the
      requesting user has the necessary permissions to access that specific
      server group. This can be achieved by verifying the user's role or access
      level against the server group's access control policies.

 2. Insecure Error Handling:
    
    * Location: Line 140
    * Description: In the delete method, there is no differentiation in the
      error response for cases where the server group does not exist and when
      another error occurs during the deletion process. Providing the same error
      response in both scenarios can potentially leak information about the
      existence of server groups, aiding attackers in reconnaissance activities.
    * Solution: Differentiate between the error responses for different
      scenarios. If the server group does not exist, return a generic error
      message without revealing specific details. For other errors during
      deletion, provide a more informative error message to aid in
      troubleshooting, but avoid revealing sensitive information.

 3. Information Disclosure through Logging:
    
    * Location: Line 75
    * Description: The code logs information about the
