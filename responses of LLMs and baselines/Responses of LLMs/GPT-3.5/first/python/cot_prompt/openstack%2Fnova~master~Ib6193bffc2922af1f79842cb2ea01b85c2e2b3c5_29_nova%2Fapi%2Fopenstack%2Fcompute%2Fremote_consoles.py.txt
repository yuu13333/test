In the provided code, there are no obvious security defects related to
vulnerabilities like injection attacks or insecure data handling. However, there
are a few areas where security best practices could be improved:

 1. Potential Information Disclosure:
    
    * Line 46: The line context.can(rc_policies.BASE_POLICY_NAME) is used to
      check if the user has the required permissions. However, the error
      messages returned in the exception handlers (lines 56, 84, 114, 138) might
      expose internal details of the system to users. It's generally a good
      practice to return generic error messages to users and log detailed error
      messages for debugging purposes.

 2. Input Validation:
    
    * Lines 53, 80, 111, 137: Input from the user, such as instance IDs and
      console types, is not validated for correctness before use. While some
      validation is performed within the get_*_console methods, it's essential
      to validate user input at the entry point to prevent potential attacks
      like injection.
    * Lines 44, 72, 101, 129: While there is validation for the request body
      schemas, additional validation for the parameters extracted from the
      request body could be beneficial.

 3. Error Handling:
    
    * Lines 56, 84, 114, 138: Error handling is implemented using exception
      catching. However, the error messages returned to the user might reveal
      sensitive information or aid attackers in crafting further attacks. It's
      crucial to provide minimal information in error messages to avoid
      information leaka
