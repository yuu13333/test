The original code contains a potential security defect related to token handling
and origin validation. Here's a detailed analysis:

 1. Insecure Token Handling (Line 86-112):
    
    * Security Defect: The code retrieves the token from the query parameters
      (token = urlparse.parse_qs(query).get("token", [""]).pop()) and later from
      the cookie header (hcookie = self.headers.get('cookie')). However, it does
      not sanitize or validate these inputs, which could lead to security issues
      such as token leakage or injection.
    * Solution:
      * Sanitize the token input by checking its format and length before
        processing it.
      * Use a secure storage mechanism (e.g., encrypted storage) for tokens.
      * Implement proper validation and error handling for token retrieval to
        prevent token leakage or injection.

 2. Incomplete Origin Validation (Line 115-138):
    
    * Security Defect: The code performs origin validation but does not check
      for the Sec-WebSocket-Origin header, which is part of the WebSocket
      protocol. This could allow for Cross-Origin WebSocket Hijacking (COWH)
      attacks.
    * Solution:
      * Add validation for the Sec-WebSocket-Origin header to ensure it matches
        the expected origin.
      * Implement proper error handling for invalid origins to prevent COWH
        attacks.

 3. Missing CSRF Protection (Line 92-104):
    
    * Security Defect: The code retrieves the token from the cookie header
      without CSRF protection, which could lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery
      (CSRF) attacks.
    * Solution:
      * Impleme
