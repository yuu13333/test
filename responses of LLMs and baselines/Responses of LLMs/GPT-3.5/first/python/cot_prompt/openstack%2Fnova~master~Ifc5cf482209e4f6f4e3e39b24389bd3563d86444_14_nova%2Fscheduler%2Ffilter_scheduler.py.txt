Upon analyzing the original code provided in the filter_scheduler.py file, I did
not detect any specific security defects. The code appears to follow best
practices for handling authentication and authorization, parameter validation,
and resource allocation without introducing vulnerabilities such as injection
attacks, insecure data handling, or access control issues. Therefore, I can
confidently say:

No security defects are detected in the code.

However, it's important to note that security is a continuous process, and code
should be regularly reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities, especially
in sensitive areas like authentication, data validation, and external API
interactions. Incorporating automated security testing tools and following
secure coding guidelines can further enhance the overall security posture of the
application.
