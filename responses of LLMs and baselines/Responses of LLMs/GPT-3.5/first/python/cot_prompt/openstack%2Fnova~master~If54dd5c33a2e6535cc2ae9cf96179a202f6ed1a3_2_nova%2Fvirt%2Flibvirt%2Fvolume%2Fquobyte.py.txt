Here's an analysis of the original code for security defects:

 1. Line 31: The use of logging.getLogger(__name__) can potentially lead to
    information leakage if sensitive information is logged and the log files are
    not adequately protected. Ensure that only necessary and non-sensitive
    information is logged, and configure proper log file permissions to prevent
    unauthorized access.
    
    Solution: Review the logging statements throughout the codebase to ensure
    they do not expose sensitive data. Additionally, ensure that log files are
    stored securely with restricted access permissions.

 2. Line 68: The code is executing a system command systemctl is-system-running
    without sufficient input validation or sanitization. This can lead to
    command injection vulnerabilities if untrusted input is passed to this
    function.
    
    Solution: Validate and sanitize input before executing system commands. Use
    parameterized commands or safe APIs provided by the underlying framework
    (e.g., subprocess.run() with shell=False) to avoid command injection
    vulnerabilities.

 3. Line 108: The code uses psutil.disk_partitions() to retrieve disk
    information, which might expose system-specific details to unauthorized
    users or attackers if this information is leaked or manipulated.
    
    Solution: Limit the exposure of system-specific details in error messages or
    logs. Implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive system
    information.

 4. Line 170: The code attempts to check the existence of a mount path using
    os.stat(), which may not be sufficient for verifying the integrity and
    security of the mounted volume. An attacker could potentially manipulate or
    spoof the mount path to bypass security checks.
    
    Solution: Instead of relying solely on os.stat() to check mount path
    existence, consider using additional checks such as verifying filesystem
    types, permissions, and ownership to ensure the security and integrity of
    mounted volumes.

 5. Line 183: The validate_volume() function checks
