Security Defects:

1. Potential Information Disclosure
   - Line: 22, 33
   - Description: The policy rules BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'index' and BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'host_info:index' both use string formatting to generate policy names. These policy names might inadvertently leak sensitive information, especially if the format string is changed to include sensitive data.
   - Solution: Use a more generic policy name or ensure that sensitive information is not included in the format string.

No security defects are detected in the code.
