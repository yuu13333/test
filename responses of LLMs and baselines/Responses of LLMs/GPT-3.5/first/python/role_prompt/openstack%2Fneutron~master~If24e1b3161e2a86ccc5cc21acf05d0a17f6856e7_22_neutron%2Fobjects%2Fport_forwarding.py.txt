The code you provided is well-structured and appears to follow best practices.
However, there are some areas where security improvements could be made:

 1. Insecure Object Loading (Line 72-88):
    
    * Security Defect: The obj_load_attr method in the PortForwarding class
      performs attribute loading from an external object (fip_obj) without
      validating the source or ensuring the integrity of the data.
    * Line: 72-88
    * Solution: Implement proper validation and sanitization checks on the data
      loaded from fip_obj to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
      Ensure that the source of the object is trusted and perform necessary
      checks on the attributes before setting them.

 2. Direct Database Query (Line 119-124):
    
    * Security Defect: The get_port_forwarding_obj_by_routers method directly
      constructs a database query without using parameterized queries.
    * Line: 119-124
    * Solution: Instead of directly concatenating router_ids into the query, use
      parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Parameterized
      queries ensure that user input is treated as data rather than executable
      code.

By addressing these issues, the code can be further strengthened against
potential security vulnerabilities.
