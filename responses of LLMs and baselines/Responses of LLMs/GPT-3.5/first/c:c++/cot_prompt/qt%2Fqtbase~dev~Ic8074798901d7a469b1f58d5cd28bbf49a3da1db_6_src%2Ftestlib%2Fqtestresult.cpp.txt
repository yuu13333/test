Upon analyzing the original code for security defects, I have identified a
potential security issue:


SECURITY DEFECT:

In the compareHelper function (line 355), there is a potential buffer overflow
vulnerability when constructing the failure message. The function uses qsnprintf
to format the failure message into a fixed-size buffer (msg) of 1024 bytes
without proper bounds checking. If the length of the formatted message exceeds
the size of the buffer, it can lead to a buffer overflow, resulting in undefined
behavior and possibly a security vulnerability.
