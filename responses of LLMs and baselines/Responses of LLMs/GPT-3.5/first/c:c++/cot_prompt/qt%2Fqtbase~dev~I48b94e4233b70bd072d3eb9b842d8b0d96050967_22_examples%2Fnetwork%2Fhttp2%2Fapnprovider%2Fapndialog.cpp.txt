Here are some potential security defects found in the original code along with
their corresponding line numbers and solutions:

 1. Insecure SslConfiguration Handling:
    
    * Line Number: 152 in apndialog.cpp.
    * Issue: The code reads a PKCS12 certificate file without any validation,
      which can lead to loading a malicious or invalid certificate.
    * Solution: Add input validation checks to ensure that only valid and
      trusted certificate files are loaded. For example, you can check the file
      extension, validate the file contents, and verify the certificate's
      authenticity before using it in SSL configuration.

 2. Missing SSL Verification:
    
    * Line Numbers: 174 in apndialog.cpp.
    * Issue: The SSL configuration sets QSslSocket::VerifyNone, which disables
      SSL certificate verification, making the application vulnerable to
      man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * Solution: Change QSslSocket::VerifyNone to QSslSocket::VerifyPeer or
      QSslSocket::VerifyPeerCertificate to enable SSL certificate verification.
      This ensures that the client verifies the server's SSL certificate during
      the SSL handshake process, providing a secure connection.

 3. Potential Memory Leak:
    
    * Line Numbers: 113 and 191 in apndialog.cpp.
    * Issue: The code may lead to a memory leak if provider->start() fails and
      the provider is not properly cleaned up.
    * Solution: Ensure that resources allocated during the startProvider()
      method are properly released in case of failure. For example, you can add
      cleanup logic in the startProvider() method or handle cleanup in the
