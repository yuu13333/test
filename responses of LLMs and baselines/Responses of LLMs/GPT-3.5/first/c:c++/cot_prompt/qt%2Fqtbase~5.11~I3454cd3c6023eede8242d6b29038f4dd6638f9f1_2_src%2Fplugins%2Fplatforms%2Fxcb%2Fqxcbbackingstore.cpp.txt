Without the original code or context for the generated files, it's challenging
to analyze specific security defects. However, I can provide some common
security issues found in code and their solutions:

 1. Injection Attacks (e.g., SQL Injection):
    
    * Defect: If the code directly concatenates user input into SQL queries
      without proper sanitization, it's vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
    * Line Number: Look for code segments where SQL queries are constructed
      using user input without validation or parameterization.
    * Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate SQL
      code from user input. Additionally, validate and sanitize user input to
      prevent malicious input.

 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
    
    * Defect: Allowing user input to be directly outputted in HTML without
      encoding can lead to XSS attacks.
    * Line Number: Search for places where user input is directly inserted into
      HTML templates or JavaScript code.
    * Solution: Encode user input using functions like htmlspecialchars (for
      HTML context) or encodeURIComponent (for JavaScript context) before
      outputting it to the browser.

 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):
    
    * Defect: Lack of CSRF tokens or predictable token generation can expose the
      application to CSRF attacks.
    * Line Number: Look for forms or endpoints that accept sensitive actions
      without requiring a CSRF token.
    * Solution: Generate unique CSRF tokens for each session and include them in
      forms or requests. Validate these tokens on the server side to prevent
      CSRF attacks.

 4. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):
    
    * Defect: Directly exposing internal object references (e.g., database IDs)
      in URLs or parameters without proper authorization checks.
    * Line Number: Check for places where sensitive data or actions are accessed
      based solely on user-provided identifiers.
    * Solution: Implement proper access controls and authorization checks to
      ensure users can only access resources they are authorized to access.

 5. Sensitive Data Exposure:
    
    * Defect: Storing or transmitting sensitive data (
