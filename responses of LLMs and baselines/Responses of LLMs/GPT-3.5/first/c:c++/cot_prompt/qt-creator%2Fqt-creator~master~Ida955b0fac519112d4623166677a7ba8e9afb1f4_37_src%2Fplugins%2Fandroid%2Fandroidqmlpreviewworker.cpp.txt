Upon analyzing the provided code, I have identified potential security issues:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability (Line 127, Line 184, Line 243): In the
    functions runAdbCommand, runAdbShellCommand, and startLogcat, command
    injection vulnerabilities are present. The functions construct commands
    using user-controlled data without proper validation or sanitization, which
    can lead to arbitrary command execution by an attacker.
    
    Solution: Use proper parameterization or quoting to ensure that
    user-controlled data is treated as data rather than executable code. For
    example, in runAdbShellCommand, instead of directly concatenating the user
    input dev with the shellCmd, use proper argument passing mechanisms provided
    by the API.

 2. Information Disclosure (Line 176, Line 244): In the functions runPreviewApp
    and stopPreviewApp, the application's log messages are being appended to the
    output without any filtering. This may lead to information disclosure, such
    as exposing sensitive information or internal workings of the application,
    to unauthorized users.
    
    Solution: Implement appropriate logging mechanisms to ensure that only
    necessary information is logged and sensitive data is not exposed.
    Additionally, consider using logging levels to differentiate between
    different types of messages (e.g., debug, info, error) and filter them
    accordingly.

 3. Potential Path Traversal (Line 347): In the prepareUpload function, the code
    constructs a file path based on user-controlled data (qmlprojectFile). If
    proper validation is not performed, it could potentially lead to path
    traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to access files outside the intended
    directory.
    
    Solution: Validate the user input (qmlprojectFile) to ensure it only
    contains a valid file name without any directory traversal characters (e.g.,
    '..', '/', ''). Additionally, consider using platform-independent path
    manipulation functions provided by the language/framework to construct file
    paths safely.
