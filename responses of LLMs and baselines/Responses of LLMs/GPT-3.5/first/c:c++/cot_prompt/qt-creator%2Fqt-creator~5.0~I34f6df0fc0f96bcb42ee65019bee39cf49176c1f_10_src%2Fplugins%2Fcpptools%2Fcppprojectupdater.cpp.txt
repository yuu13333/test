The original code doesn't seem to have any glaring security defects. However,
I'll provide some general security considerations for code review:

 1. Memory Management: The code appears to use Qt's parent-child memory
    management system and smart pointers effectively (QPointer, QFutureWatcher).
    However, ensure that there are no memory leaks or dangling pointers,
    especially when dealing with dynamic memory allocation.

 2. Input Validation: Whenever dealing with external inputs, such as file paths
    or user input, it's essential to validate and sanitize the inputs to prevent
    injection attacks or unexpected behavior. Line 94 (for
    (QPointer<ExtraCompiler> compiler : qAsConst(m_extraCompilers))) iterates
    over a list of ExtraCompiler pointers, which might need input validation
    depending on where these pointers are obtained.

 3. Concurrency: The code utilizes threads and futures for asynchronous
    operations, which can introduce concurrency issues like race conditions or
    deadlocks. Line 90 (auto generateFuture =
    Utils::runAsync([=](QFutureInterface<ProjectInfo> &futureInterface) {)
    starts an asynchronous operation. Ensure proper synchronization mechanisms
    are in place to handle shared data access safely.

 4. Resource Management: Check for proper handling and release of resources like
    file handles, network connections, or database connections. The code seems
    to manage resources well, but it's essential to verify that resources are
    released correctly, especially in error or cancellation scenarios.

 5. Error Handling: Verify that errors are handled gracefully and securely.
    Ensure that sensitive information is not leaked through error messages. The
    code handles errors using Qt's signaling mechanism (QFutureWatcher), but
    it's crucial to review error handling logic thoroughly to prevent
    information d
