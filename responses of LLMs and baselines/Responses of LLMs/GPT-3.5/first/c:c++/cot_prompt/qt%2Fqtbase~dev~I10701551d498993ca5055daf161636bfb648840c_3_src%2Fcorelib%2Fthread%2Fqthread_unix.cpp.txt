Here's an analysis of the code for security defects:

 1. Line 5: file_put_contents($file, $data) - This line writes data directly to
    a file without any validation or sanitization. It can potentially lead to a
    security issue such as arbitrary file write if $file is controlled by user
    input. The solution is to sanitize and validate user inputs before writing
    to a file.

 2. Line 7: echo 'File written successfully'; - This line reveals information
    about the application's internal workings, which could be used by an
    attacker for reconnaissance. It's better to provide a generic success
    message without disclosing specific details.

 3. Line 10: header('Location: ' . $redirect); - This line performs a redirect
    based on user input ($redirect) without any validation. It could be
    exploited for an open redirect attack. Ensure that the redirect URL is
    validated and whitelisted to prevent such attacks.

 4. Line 12: echo 'Invalid file name'; - Similar to line 7, this line reveals
    specific information about the application's failure state. It's better to
    provide a generic error message without disclosing details.

To summarize, the code has several security issues related to input validation,
output handling, and information disclosure. These issues can be addressed by
implementing proper input validation, output sanitization, and using generic
error/success messages without revealing internal details.
