The original code seems to be well-structured and primarily focused on
mathematical calculations and constants. Upon review, I haven't identified any
obvious security defects such as buffer overflows, injection vulnerabilities, or
insecure random number generation.

However, there are a few considerations regarding potential issues:

 1. Potential Floating Point Issues: Floating-point arithmetic can sometimes
    lead to precision errors, especially in mathematical functions like qFastSin
    and qFastCos (lines 252-269). While these functions are optimized for
    performance, they might produce unexpected results in edge cases. A thorough
    testing regime is necessary to ensure correctness across various inputs.

 2. Non-Constant Time Operations: Certain operations, especially in
    cryptographic contexts, need to execute in constant time to prevent timing
    attacks. While the provided code doesn't seem to handle cryptographic
    operations, it's worth noting for future reference if such functionality is
    introduced.

 3. Macro Usage: The code uses macros like M_PI, M_PI_2, etc., to define
    mathematical constants. While widely used, macros can sometimes lead to
    unexpected behavior, especially when used in complex expressions. Using
    constexpr variables (which are introduced in C++11) could provide a safer
    alternative, ensuring type safety and avoiding potential macro-related
    issues.

Overall, the code appears to be written with care and attention to detail, but
thorough testing and consideration of potential edge cases are essential to
ensure its robustness and security.

No security defects are detected in the code.
