Upon analyzing the original code for security defects, the following issues are
identified:

 1. Potential buffer overflow:
    
    * Line 433: In the function main(), the code reads the file size and
      allocates memory for buffer using the file size plus one byte for
      null-termination. However, there's no check on the file size, and it's
      directly used for memory allocation, which can lead to a buffer overflow
      if the file size is larger than the available memory.
    * Solution: Before allocating memory for buffer, validate the file size to
      ensure it's within a reasonable limit. If the file size exceeds the limit,
      handle it gracefully, possibly by rejecting the file or allocating a
      maximum allowed buffer size.

 2. Potential memory leak:
    
    * Line 127, Line 147: In the functions decode_base64() and
      decode_base64url(), memory is allocated for data but not freed if an error
      occurs during decoding.
    * Solution: Before returning from the functions in case of an error, free
      the allocated memory for data.

 3. Improper handling of input arguments:
    
    * Line 401-416: In the main() function, the handling of input arguments
      could be improved. Unknown options are reported, but the program still
      continues execution. Additionally, the help message might not be accurate
      as it does not mention the input file argument.
    * Solution: After reporting an unknown option, terminate the program or
      handle the unknown option appropriately. Also, ensure the help
