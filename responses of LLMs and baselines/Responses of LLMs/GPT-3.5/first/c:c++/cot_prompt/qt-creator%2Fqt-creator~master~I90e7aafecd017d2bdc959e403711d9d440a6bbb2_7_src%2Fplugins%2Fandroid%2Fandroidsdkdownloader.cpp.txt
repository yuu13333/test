Let's analyze the original code for security defects:

 1. Potential Memory Leak:
    
    * Line 92: The m_progressDialog object is created dynamically with new, but
      there's no corresponding delete or cleanup in the destructor or elsewhere
      in the code. This can lead to a memory leak if the object is not properly
      deleted when it's no longer needed.
    * Solution: Add a destructor for the AndroidSdkDownloader class and delete
      m_progressDialog in the destructor to ensure proper cleanup of dynamically
      allocated resources.

 2. Incomplete SSL Error Handling:
    
    * Lines 47-54 and 85-87: SSL errors are logged but not handled in a
      comprehensive manner. While logging errors is useful for debugging, it's
      essential to handle SSL errors properly to ensure secure communication.
    * Solution: Implement a more robust SSL error handling mechanism that
      includes user notification, error handling, and potentially retry logic
      for SSL-related issues.

 3. Potential Command Injection:
    
    * Lines 116-122: The jarCmdPath variable is constructed using user-supplied
      input (jdkPath). If jdkPath is not sanitized properly, it could lead to
      command injection vulnerabilities.
    * Solution: Ensure that jdkPath is properly validated and sanitized to
      prevent any unintended command execution. Consider using absolute paths or
      whitelisting allowed paths if applicable.

 4. Incomplete Network Reply Handling:
    
    * Lines 181-203: While network replies are processed, there's no handling
      for unexpected or malicious responses. For example, if the download server
      sends unexpected content or malicious payloads, the application might
      behave unpredictably.
    * Solution: Implement comprehensi
