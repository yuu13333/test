SECURITY DEFECTS REVIEW:

 1.  CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): The code seems to follow
     Qt's coding standards and best practices, so there are no issues related to
     this CWE.
 2.  CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): No instances of improper access control
     are present in the code.
 3.  CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities): No evidence of
     improper interaction between entities.
 4.  CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime): No issues
     related to resource control.
 5.  CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): Line 86 has a typo that could lead to
     incorrect comparison. It should be && instead of ! to correctly check both
     conditions.
 6.  CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): No instances of
     insufficient control flow management.
 7.  CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): No evidence of protection mechanism
     failure.
 8.  CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): Line 86 has a comparison issue due to a
     typo. It should be && instead of !.
 9.  CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): No improper
     handling of exceptional conditions.
 10. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): No improper neutralization issues.


SUMMARY:

The code is generally well-structured and follows Qt's coding standards.
However, there is a typo in the operator!= implementation at line 86, where it
should use && instead of !. Here's the corrected line:

cpp
Copy code
friend constexpr inline bool operator!=(const QPointF &p1, const QPointF &p2) noexcept
{ return p1.xp != p2.xp || p1.yp != p2.yp; }



CONCLUSION:

Overall, the code appears to be secure with the suggested correction.
