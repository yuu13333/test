The code you provided appears to be a part of the Qt Creator project,
specifically focusing on file operations. Here's a review for security defects:

 1.  Line 37: The Utils namespace is used, which is a good practice for avoiding
     naming conflicts. However, it's important to ensure that the namespace
     doesn't inadvertently expose sensitive functionality or data.

 2.  Line 39: The m_umask variable is declared as a static member of the
     SaveFile class to store file permissions. This could lead to unexpected
     behavior if multiple instances of SaveFile are used concurrently, as they
     would share the same m_umask value.

 3.  Line 53: While checking if m_finalFileName is empty is good practice, it
     would be better to handle this case more gracefully, perhaps by throwing an
     exception or logging an error message.

 4.  Line 62: Creating a QTemporaryFile with the same name as m_finalFileName
     might lead to file overwrite if m_finalFileName already exists. Consider
     generating a unique temporary file name instead.

 5.  Line 67: The QFile::open(flags) call doesn't seem to be correct, as it's
     trying to open a file that hasn't been created yet (m_tempFile). This could
     lead to unexpected behavior.

 6.  Line 72: Setting permissions based on an existing file (ofi) without
     verifying ownership could be a security risk, as it may allow users to set
     arbitrary permissions on files they do not own.

 7.  Line 120: The finalFileName variable is resolved using
     FileUtils::resolveSymlinks. Ensure that this operation is safe and doesn't
     introduce vulnerabilities related to symlink traversal.

 8.  Line 146: Creating a backup file (backupName) is a good practice, but
     ensure that this operation is atomic and doesn't introduce race conditions
     or vulnerabilities.

 9.  Line 161: Renaming m_tempFile to finalFileName could lead to file overwrite
     if finalFileName already exists. Consider checking for existence before
     renaming.

 10. Line 168: If the rename operation fails
     (!m_tempFile->rename(finalFileName)), the temporary file (m_tempFile) is
     removed, but the error string is not cleared. Ensure that error handling is
     consistent.

 11. Line 171: The backup file (backupName) is removed after the final file is
     renamed, but ensure that this operation is safe and doesn't introduce
     vulnerabilities.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and follows good practices.
However, there are some areas that could be improved to enhance security and
robustness.
