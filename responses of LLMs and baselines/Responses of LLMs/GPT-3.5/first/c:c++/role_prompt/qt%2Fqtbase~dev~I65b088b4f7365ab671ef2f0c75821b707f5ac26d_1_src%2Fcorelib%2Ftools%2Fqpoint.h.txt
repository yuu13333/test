The code you've provided seems to be the implementation of the QPoint and
QPointF classes in Qt. Overall, the code looks well-structured and doesn't
contain any obvious security defects. However, I'll provide a general review and
suggest some improvements for clarity and maintainability:

 1.  Line 55 (constexpr QPoint(int xpos, int ypos) noexcept;): This constructor
     initializes a QPoint object with the given xpos and ypos values. Since it's
     marked as constexpr, it ensures that the object can be constructed at
     compile-time if the arguments are known at compile-time.

 2.  Lines 57-62 (isNull, x, y, setX, setY): These methods provide access to the
     x and y coordinates of the QPoint object. The isNull method checks if both
     coordinates are zero, indicating a null point.

 3.  Line 64 (constexpr inline int manhattanLength() const;): This method
     calculates the Manhattan length of the point, which is the sum of the
     absolute values of its x and y coordinates. It's marked as constexpr, which
     means it can be evaluated at compile-time if the x and y values are known
     at compile-time.

 4.  Lines 66-69 (transposed, rx, ry): These methods provide a way to transpose
     the point (swap x and y), access the x and y coordinates by reference,
     allowing them to be modified directly.

 5.  Lines 71-82 (operator overloads): These overload various operators (+=, -=,
     *=, /=, ==, !=, +, -, *, /) to perform arithmetic and comparison operations
     on QPoint objects. They are implemented as constexpr functions, ensuring
     they can be evaluated at compile-time where possible.

 6.  Lines 113-133 (QPointF definition): This defines the QPointF class, which
     is similar to QPoint but uses qreal instead of int for its coordinates. It
     provides similar functionality to QPoint.

 7.  Line 147 (constexpr inline QPointF::QPointF() noexcept : xp(0), yp(0) { }):
     This is the default constructor for QPointF, which initializes both xp and
     yp to zero.

 8.  Line 147 (constexpr inline QPointF::QPointF() noexcept : xp(0), yp(0) { }):
     This is the constructor that initializes a QPointF object with the given
     xpos and ypos values.

 9.  Lines 153-154 (constexpr inline bool QPointF::isNull() const noexcept {
     return qIsNull(xp) && qIsNull(yp); }): This method checks if both x and y
     coordinates are null (i.e., both are close to zero). It uses the qIsNull
     macro to perform the check.

 10. Lines 156-161 (constexpr inline qreal QPointF::x() const noexcept { return
     xp; }, constexpr inline qreal QPointF::y() const noexcept { return yp; }):
     These methods provide access to the x and y coordinates of the QPointF
     object, respectively.

 11. Lines 171-176 (constexpr inline void QPointF::setX(qreal xpos) noexcept {
     xp = xpos; }, constexpr inline void QPointF::setY(qreal ypos) noexcept { yp
     = ypos; }): These methods set the x and y coordinates of the QPointF
     object, respectively.

 12. Lines 178-182 (constexpr inline qreal &QPointF::rx() noexcept { return xp;
     }, constexpr inline qreal &QPointF::ry() noexcept { return yp; }): These
     methods provide access to the x and y coordinates of the QPointF object by
     reference, allowing them to be modified directly.

 13. Lines 184-187 (constexpr inline QPointF &QPointF::operator+=(const QPointF
     &p), constexpr inline QPointF &QPointF::operator-=(const QPointF &p),
     constexpr inline QPointF &QPointF::operator*=(qreal c), constexpr inline
     QPointF &QPointF::operator/=(qreal divisor)): These methods overload the
     +=, -=, *= and /= operators to perform arithmetic operations on QPointF
     objects.

 14. Lines 198-302 (friend constexpr inline bool operator==(const QPointF &p1,
     const QPointF &p2), friend constexpr inline bool operator!=(const QPointF
     &p1, const QPointF &p2), friend constexpr inline QPointF operator+(const
     QPointF &p1, const QPointF &p2), friend constexpr inline QPointF
     operator-(const QPointF &p1, const QPointF &p2), friend constexpr inline
     QPointF operator*(const QPointF &p, qreal c), friend constexpr inline
     QPointF operator*(qreal c, const QPointF &p), friend constexpr inline
     QPointF operator+(const QPointF &p), friend constexpr inline QPointF
     operator-(const QPointF &p), friend constexpr inline QPointF
     operator/(const QPointF &p, qreal divisor)): These friend functions
     overload various operators for QPointF objects, allowing arithmetic and
     comparison operations.

Overall, the code looks well-written and does not contain any obvious security
defects. However, it's important to note that this is a general review, and a
more thorough security review may be necessary depending on the specific
requirements and use cases of your application.
