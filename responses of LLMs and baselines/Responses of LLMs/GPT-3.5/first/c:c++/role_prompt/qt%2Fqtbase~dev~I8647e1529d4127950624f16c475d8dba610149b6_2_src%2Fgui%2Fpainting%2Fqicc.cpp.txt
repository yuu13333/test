The code does not contain any obvious security defects. However, here are some
general suggestions for enhancing security in similar contexts:

 1. Input Validation: Ensure that inputs, such as file paths or user inputs, are
    properly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks or unexpected
    behavior.

 2. Memory Safety: Use safe memory management practices, such as avoiding buffer
    overflows and memory leaks, especially when dealing with dynamically
    allocated memory or external data.

 3. Data Integrity: Implement measures to ensure the integrity of data, such as
    using cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity of files or messages.

 4. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle
    unexpected situations and prevent information disclosure or crashes.

 5. Code Review: Conduct regular code reviews to identify and mitigate security
    vulnerabilities early in the development process.
