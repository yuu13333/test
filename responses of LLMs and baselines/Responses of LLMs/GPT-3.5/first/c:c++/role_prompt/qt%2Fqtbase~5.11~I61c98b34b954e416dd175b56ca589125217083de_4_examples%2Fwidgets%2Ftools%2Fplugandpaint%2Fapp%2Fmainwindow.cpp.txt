The code appears to be well-structured and follows good practices. However,
there are a few security considerations to be noted:

 1. Untrusted File Loading (Potential Path Traversal):
    
    * Line 92: When opening a file using QFileDialog::getOpenFileName, there's a
      risk of path traversal if the file path is not validated properly.
      Attackers could potentially supply a malicious file path to access
      sensitive files outside of the intended directory.
    * Solution: Ensure that the file path obtained from
      QFileDialog::getOpenFileName is properly validated and sanitized to
      prevent directory traversal attacks. You can restrict file access to
      specific directories or perform additional checks on the file path to
      ensure it's within the expected scope.

 2. Untrusted File Saving (Potential File Overwrite):
    
    * Line 109: When saving a file using QFileDialog::getSaveFileName, there's a
      risk of unintentional file overwrite if the user selects an existing file
      without confirmation.
    * Solution: Before saving the file, it's advisable to check if the selected
      file already exists and prompt the user for confirmation before
      overwriting it.

 3. Plugin Loading (Potential Code Execution):
    
    * Line 268: Loading plugins using QPluginLoader can introduce security risks
      if the plugins are not properly validated. Malicious plugins could execute
      arbitrary code when loaded, leading to potential security breaches.
    * Solution: Implement strict validation mechanisms for loaded plugins.
      Consider using code signing or digital signatures to ensure the
      authenticity and integrity of plugins. Additionally, limit the privileges
      granted to loaded plugins to minimize the impact of potential
      vulnerabilities.

These issues should be addressed to ensure the security of the application.
