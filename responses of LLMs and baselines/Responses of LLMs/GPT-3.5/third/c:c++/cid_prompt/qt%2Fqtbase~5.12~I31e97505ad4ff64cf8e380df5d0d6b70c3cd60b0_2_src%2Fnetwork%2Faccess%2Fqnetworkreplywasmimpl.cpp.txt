The provided code appears to handle network requests and responses in an
environment utilizing Emscripten for WebAssembly. While the code is quite
extensive, I'll focus on potential security defects based on the CWE categories
you've provided:

 1.  CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
     
     * Line 64: The q_requestErrorCallback function accesses xhr["data-handler"]
       without proper validation, potentially leading to improper access
       control.

 2.  CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
     
     * No evident issues found.

 3.  CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
     
     * Line 95: The q_loadCallback function uses xhr["data-handler"] without
       ensuring the validity or lifetime of the resource.

 4.  CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
     
     * No evident issues found.

 5.  CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
     
     * Line 128: The condition if (readyState == 4) in q_loadCallback might not
       cover all possible states, leading to control flow issues.

 6.  CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
     
     * No evident issues found.

 7.  CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
     
     * Line 109: There's a typo in the condition status == 200 status == 203. It
       should likely be status == 200 || status == 203.

 8.  CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
     
     * No evident issues found.

 9.  CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
     
     * No evident issues found.

 10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
     
     * Line 90: In q_loadCallback, consider explicitly handling the case where
       xhr["lengthComputable"] is false to ensure proper adherence to coding
       standards.

Given these observations, the code could benefit from additional validation and
error handling to address these potential security concerns. Furthermore,
thorough testing, especially regarding different network states and responses,
is essential to ensure the robustness of the application.
