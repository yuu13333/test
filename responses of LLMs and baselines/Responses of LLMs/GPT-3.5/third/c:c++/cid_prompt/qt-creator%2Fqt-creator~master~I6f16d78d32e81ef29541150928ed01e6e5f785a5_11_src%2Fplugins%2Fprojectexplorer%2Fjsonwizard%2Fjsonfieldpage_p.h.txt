The provided code seems to be a C++ header file defining classes and their
member functions. I'll review the code for security defects based on the
provided defect types:

 1.  CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): This involves improper restrictions on
     what authenticated users are allowed to do. I don't see any evidence of
     user authentication or access control mechanisms in this code.

 2.  CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities): There's no
     obvious interaction between multiple entities that could lead to security
     issues in this code.

 3.  CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime): This
     involves issues where resources are not properly managed, leading to
     resource exhaustion or use-after-free vulnerabilities. The code appears to
     be managing resources like widgets and data structures correctly.

 4.  CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): There are no calculations or numeric
     operations in this code that could lead to incorrect results or
     vulnerabilities.

 5.  CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): There are no apparent
     issues with control flow management in this code.

 6.  CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): There are no protection mechanisms
     explicitly implemented in this code that could fail.

 7.  CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): There are no comparison operations in the
     code that could lead to incorrect results or security vulnerabilities.

 8.  CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): Exception
     handling is not explicitly implemented in this code. Proper exception
     handling could be beneficial for robustness, but its absence doesn't
     necessarily indicate a security flaw.

 9.  CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): This involves failing to neutralize or
     escape characters in user input, leading to injection attacks. There's no
     user input or external data processing in this code, so this CWE doesn't
     apply.

 10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): The code appears to
     follow coding standards and best practices for C++ development. However,
     adherence to specific coding standards may vary based on project
     requirements and team conventions.

Conclusion: No security defects are detected in the provided code. It seems to
be well-structured and focused on defining classes and their member functions
for use within a Qt Creator project.
