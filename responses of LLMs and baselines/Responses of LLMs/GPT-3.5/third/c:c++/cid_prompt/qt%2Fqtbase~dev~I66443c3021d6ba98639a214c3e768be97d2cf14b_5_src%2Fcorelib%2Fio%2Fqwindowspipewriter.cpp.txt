The code appears to be well-structured and follows proper coding standards. I'll
review it for potential security defects based on the provided list of CWEs.

 1.  CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
     
     * No improper access control issues found.

 2.  CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
     
     * No improper interaction issues found.

 3.  CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
     
     * No improper control of resource issues found.

 4.  CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
     
     * No incorrect calculation issues found.

 5.  CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
     
     * No insufficient control flow management issues found.

 6.  CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
     
     * No protection mechanism failure issues found.

 7.  CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
     
     * No incorrect comparison issues found.

 8.  CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
     
     * There's a potential issue in QWindowsPipeWriter::writeCompleted method.
       In line 240, ERROR_NO_DATA is used to check for a specific error
       condition, but it's better to review if this error code accurately
       represents the intended condition.
     * Line 240: if (errorCode != ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED && errorCode !=
       ERROR_NO_DATA)

 9.  CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
     
     * No improper neutralization issues found.

 10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):

 * No improper adherence to coding standards found.

Overall, the code appears to be free from most common security defects. The
potential issue related to error handling could be reviewed for accuracy and
completeness in handling exceptional conditions.
