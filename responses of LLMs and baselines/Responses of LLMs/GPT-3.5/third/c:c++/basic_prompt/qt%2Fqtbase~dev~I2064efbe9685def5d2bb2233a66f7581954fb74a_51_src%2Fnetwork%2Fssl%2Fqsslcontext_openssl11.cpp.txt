Reviewing the code, there appears to be no overt security defects with the
implementation as such, but there are a few best practices and optimizations
that could improve the robustness and security of the SSL/TLS setup. Below are
some observations and recommendations:

 1. Unsupported Protocol (Line 75): The code gracefully handles unsupported
    SSLv2 protocol, which is good since SSLv2 is considered insecure. It
    correctly sets the context to nullptr if SSLv2 is used. However, this could
    be extended to check for SSLv3 as well, which is also considered insecure
    due to vulnerabilities like POODLE.
    
    Solution: Add a check for SSLv3 in the condition and handle it similarly by
    setting the context to nullptr.

 2. Cipher List (Line 122): The program dynamically constructs the cipher list.
    It is crucial that the cipher list is constructed securely to avoid
    including weak ciphers. The code checks if the cipher list setup fails and
    returns an error if it does. It would be beneficial to enforce strong
    defaults that exclude outdated or weak cipher suites explicitly.
    
    Solution: Explicitly define and enforce strong cipher suites, possibly
    consulting recent security standards or recommendations such as those by
    NIST.

 3. Certificate Expiry (Line 144): There is a check for the certificate
    expiration before adding it to the SSL context. This is a good practice.
    However, the code does not handle the scenario where all available
    certificates might be expired, which might leave the SSL context without any
    valid CA certificates.
    
    Solution: Add error handling for the situation where no valid certificates
    are available to be loaded into the SSL context.

 4. Private Key Consistency (Line 199): The code checks if the loaded private
    key matches the public key of the certificate, which is a critical security
    check. This is correctly implemented.

 5. Elliptic Curves Configuration (Line 256): There's an attempt to configure
    elliptic curves for SSL/TLS connections. However, there seems to be a
    fallback message about an outdated OpenSSL version if curves are requested
    but setting them fails (Line 269). Itâ€™s good to ensure compatibility with
    recent OpenSSL versions that support such configurations.
    
    Solution: Ensure that the deployed environment runs a supported version of
    OpenSSL, ideally 1.0.2 or newer, which is necessary for this configuration.

 6. Error Messages and Logging (Throughout): The code generally does well in
    providing error messages. It's crucial that these messages give enough
    information for debugging without exposing sensitive information, such as
    cryptographic material or system details.

 7. Memory Management and Resource Cleanup: The code generally seems to manage
    memory correctly, especially around OpenSSL objects like DH structures (Line
    247), but ensure thorough review and testing around memory management to
    avoid leaks or double-free errors, particularly in error paths and cleanup
    routines.

In summary, the code handles most scenarios well, with particular attention to
error handling and protocol security. Some additional considerations around best
practices for cipher suite configuration and system compatibility checks would
further strengthen the implementation. The suggestions provided primarily aim to
preemptively tackle potential misconfigurations or outdated setups which could
lead to vulnerabilities.
