After reviewing the code, I've identified a potential security defect in the
original code. Here's the analysis:

python
Copy code
1. import requests
2. from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
3. 
4. def scrape_website(url):
5.     response = requests.get(url)
6.     if response.status_code == 200:
7.         soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
8.         # Extracting sensitive data from the website
9.         sensitive_data = soup.find('div', class_='sensitive-info').text
10.        return sensitive_data
11.    else:
12.        return None
13. 
14. if __name__ == "__main__":
15.    website_url = input("Enter the URL of the website to scrape: ")
16.    scraped_data = scrape_website(website_url)
17.    if scraped_data:
18.        print("Sensitive data found on the website:")
19.        print(scraped_data)
20.    else:
21.        print("No sensitive data found on the website.")


Security Defect:

On line 15, the code uses the input() function to directly take user input for
the website URL without any sanitization or validation. This can lead to a
security vulnerability known as "OS Command Injection" or "Remote Code
Execution" if the user input is manipulated to include malicious commands or
URLs.

Line Number: 15

Solution:

To mitigate this security defect, input validation and sanitization should be
performed. Here's how you can improve it:

python
Copy code
import re

def validate
