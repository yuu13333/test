Here are some potential security issues found in the original code along with
their descriptions, line numbers, and suggested solutions:

 1. Potential Command Injection in openSDKDownloadUrl
    
    * Line Number: 392
    * Description: The openSDKDownloadUrl function directly constructs a URL
      string using user input without proper validation or sanitization. This
      can lead to command injection if an attacker manipulates the URL to
      include malicious commands.
    * Solution: Use a safe method to open URLs, such as
      QDesktopServices::openUrl(QUrl(urlString)). Ensure that the URL is
      validated and sanitized before passing it to this function.

 2. Unvalidated User Input in addAVD
    
    * Line Number: 407
    * Description: The addAVD function gathers information from user input
      without sufficient validation. This can lead to various security issues
      such as buffer overflows or incorrect AVD creation due to malicious input.
    * Solution: Implement robust input validation mechanisms to ensure that
      user-provided data is safe and does not contain malicious content.
      Validate input format, length, and range before using it.

 3. Potential Information Disclosure in manageAVD
    
    * Line Number: 528
    * Description: The manageAVD function checks for the availability of AVD
      manager UI tool and displays a warning message if it's not available. This
      can leak information about the system configuration to potential
      attackers.
    * Solution: Avoid exposing detailed system information or error messages
      directly to users, especially in warning or error messages. Provide
      generic error messages and log detailed information for debugging purposes
      only.

 4. Possible Denial-of-Service (DoS) in updateAvds
    
    * Line Number: 321
    * Description: The updateAvds function updates AVD information
      asynchronously using a QFutureWatcher. If this process is abused by
      sending a large number of requests, it could lead to resource exhaustion
      and a potential DoS attack.
    * Solution: Implement rate l
