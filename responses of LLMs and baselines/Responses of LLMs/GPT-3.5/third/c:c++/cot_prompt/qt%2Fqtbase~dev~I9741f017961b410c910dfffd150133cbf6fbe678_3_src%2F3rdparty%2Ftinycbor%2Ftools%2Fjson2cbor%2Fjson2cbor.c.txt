The original code seems to be well-written and doesn't exhibit any obvious
security defects. However, there are some potential areas that could be improved
to enhance security:

 1. Memory Management (Line 38, 58, 95, 99, 154, 180, 234, 258, 260, 335, 338,
    450):
    
    * Issue: The code uses dynamic memory allocation with malloc, but it lacks
      proper error handling and doesn't check for NULL return values after
      allocation.
    * Solution: Always check the return value of malloc for NULL to handle
      memory allocation failures gracefully. Additionally, ensure that allocated
      memory is properly deallocated using free to prevent memory leaks.

 2. Input Validation (Line 67, 122, 167, 172, 175, 191, 198, 214, 221, 225, 238,
    243, 248, 252, 255, 256, 259, 264, 278, 287, 343, 372):
    
    * Issue: The code doesn't perform sufficient input validation, which can
      lead to buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other vulnerabilities.
    * Solution: Implement proper input validation for user-controlled input to
      prevent buffer overflows, integer overflows, and other vulnerabilities.
      Validate input size, format, and range before processing or using it.

 3. Buffer Size Calculation (Line 57, 66, 71, 77, 80, 86, 89, 97, 100, 127, 153,
    344):
    
    * Issue: Buffer size calculations may lead to integer
