The original code provided seems relatively secure, but there are a few areas
where potential security vulnerabilities could arise:

 1. Resource Leakage (Potential):
    
    * Line 124: In the initializePythonExtensions() method, a new QDir object is
      created within a loop without being deleted afterwards. This could lead to
      resource leakage if memory is not properly managed. Although there is a
      delete extension_dir; statement in case the directory is not found, it
      should be moved outside the loop to ensure proper cleanup even if the loop
      is terminated early.
    
    Solution: Move the delete extension_dir; statement outside the loop, just
    before the return statement at line 169.

 2. Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):
    
    * Line 158: In the initializePythonExtensions() method, the script content
      is read from the main.py file and executed using PyUtil::runScript(). If
      the main.py file content is not properly sanitized or validated, it could
      potentially execute arbitrary code, leading to security vulnerabilities
      such as code injection.
    
    Solution: Implement strict input validation and sanitize the content read
    from the main.py file before executing it. Ensure that only trusted and
    authorized scripts are executed.

 3. Insecure File Access (Potential):
    
    * Line 154: In the initializePythonExtensions() method, the extension_main
      file is opened without proper validation or sanitization. If an attacker
      can control the file path or if the path is not properly validated, it
      could lead to insecure file access vulnerabilities.
    
    Solution: Ensure that the file path is properly validated and sanitized
    before opening it. Use
