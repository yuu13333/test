Upon reviewing the provided code, no explicit security defects are apparent.
However, here are a few points to consider for best practices:

 1. Memory Management:
    
    * Line 110: When creating QFuture<void> using compiler->run(), ensure proper
      memory management to prevent memory leaks. While the code deletes the
      watcher object in the finished slot, ensure the proper deletion of the
      associated QFuture object as well.

 2. Input Validation:
    
    * Lines 67-67: When updating extra compilers, ensure that proper input
      validation is performed on the extraCompilers list to avoid potential null
      pointer dereference or other unexpected behavior.

 3. Resource Handling:
    
    * Line 112: Resource handling might be improved by utilizing smart pointers
      or other RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) techniques. Ensure
      that resources are properly released in case of exceptions or errors.

Overall, while the code appears to be well-structured and functional,
maintaining a vigilant approach to memory management, input validation, and
resource handling can further enhance its robustness and security posture.
