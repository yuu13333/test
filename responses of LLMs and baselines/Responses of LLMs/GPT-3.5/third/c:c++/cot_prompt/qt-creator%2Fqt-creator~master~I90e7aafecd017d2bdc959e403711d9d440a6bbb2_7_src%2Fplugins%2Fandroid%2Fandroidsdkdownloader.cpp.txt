The original code seems to be reasonably secure, but there are a few points
worth mentioning:

 1. SSL Error Handling:
    
    * Potential Issue: In the sslErrors slot, SSL errors are logged but not
      handled otherwise.
    * Line Number: androidsdkdownloader.cpp, lines 47-54.
    * Solution: It's essential to handle SSL errors appropriately, such as
      informing the user or deciding whether to proceed with the connection.
      Depending on the application's requirements, you may choose to ignore
      certain errors, but it's crucial to have a clear understanding of the
      implications.

 2. Potential Directory Traversal Vulnerability:
    
    * Potential Issue: In the setSdkFilesExecPermission function, there's a
      possibility of a directory traversal attack due to insufficient validation
      of the input path.
    * Line Number: androidsdkdownloader.cpp, lines 57-68.
    * Solution: Ensure that the input path is properly validated and sanitized
      to prevent directory traversal attacks. Limit the operations to the
      intended directory structure.

 3. Command Injection:
    
    * Potential Issue: In the extractSdk function, the jarCmdPath is constructed
      using user-controlled input (jdkPath). If jdkPath is under the control of
      an attacker, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
    * Line Number: androidsdkdownloader.cpp, lines 116-122.
    * Solution: Validate and sanitize the jdkPath input to ensure it points to a
      legitimate JDK installation directory. Alternatively, consider using a
      safer method to extract the SDK files without invoking an external
      process.

 4. HTTP Redirect Handling:
    
    * Potential Issue: In the downloadFinished function, HTTP redirects are
      logged but not explicitly handled. This could p
