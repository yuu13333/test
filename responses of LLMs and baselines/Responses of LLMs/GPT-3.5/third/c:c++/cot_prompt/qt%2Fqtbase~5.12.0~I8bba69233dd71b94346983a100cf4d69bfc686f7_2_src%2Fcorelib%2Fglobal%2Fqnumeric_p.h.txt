Upon analyzing the original code, I've identified a potential security defect
related to integer overflow. Integer overflow can lead to undefined behavior and
potentially security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or arithmetic
errors. Here's the detailed analysis:

Potential Security Defect: Integer Overflow

 * Location: qnumeric_p.h, lines 216-328.
 * Description: The code contains custom implementations for arithmetic
   operations (add_overflow, sub_overflow, mul_overflow) to handle overflow
   scenarios for various integer types. However, these custom implementations
   might not cover all edge cases or handle overflow correctly in all scenarios.
 * Risk: Integer overflow can lead to undefined behavior, which could
   potentially be exploited by attackers to manipulate program behavior, cause
   crashes, or execute arbitrary code.
 * Solution: Instead of using custom implementations, it's recommended to
   utilize standard library functions or compiler intrinsics that provide safer
   and more efficient handling of arithmetic operations. Additionally,
   performing careful boundary checks and validation before performing
   arithmetic operations can help prevent integer overflow vulnerabilities.

In qnumeric_p.h, lines 216-328, replace the custom implementations of arithmetic
operations (add_overflow, sub_overflow, mul_overflow) with standard library
functions or compiler intrinsics that provide safe handling of arithmetic
operations, such as std::numeric_limits::max, std::numeric_limits::min, and
compiler-specific built-in functions (__builtin_add_overflow,
__builtin_sub_overflow, __builtin_mul_overflow).
