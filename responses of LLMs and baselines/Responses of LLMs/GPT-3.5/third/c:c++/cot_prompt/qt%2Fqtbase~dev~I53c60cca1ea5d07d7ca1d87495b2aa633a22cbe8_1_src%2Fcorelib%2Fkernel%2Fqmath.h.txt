In the provided original code, there are no explicit security defects. However,
I can provide some insights into potential security considerations and best
practices:

 1. Input Validation: The code does not perform explicit input validation on the
    qCeil and qFloor functions. While these functions deal with floating-point
    numbers, which are less prone to typical input validation issues like buffer
    overflows, it's still essential to validate input if it comes from external
    or untrusted sources. Validation should include checks for NaN (Not a
    Number) or infinite values to prevent unexpected behavior.

 2. Conditional Compilation: Lines 70-89 and 82-89 use conditional compilation
    based on preprocessor macros like __SSE4_1__, Q_PROCESSOR_ARM_64, and
    Q_PROCESSOR_POWER_64 to determine the optimization strategy. While this is
    common practice for optimizing code for specific architectures or compiler
    features, it can lead to maintenance challenges, especially if the codebase
    grows or changes over time. Ensuring that these conditions are
    well-documented and thoroughly tested on different platforms can mitigate
    potential issues.

 3. Use of C Standard Library Functions: The code extensively uses functions
    from the C Standard Library (<cmath>) like ceil, floor, fabs, sin, cos, etc.
    While these functions are generally considered safe, it's essential to be
    aware of any potential risks associated with certain functions, especially
    when dealing with sensitive data or security-critical applications.

 4. Code Comments: The code contains comments describing the purpose of various
    sections and functions, which is good for readability and maintainability.
    However, it's crucial to ensure that these comments are accurate and
    up-to-date to avoid confusion or misinterpretation by developers in the
    future
