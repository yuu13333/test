Based on the provided code, here are some potential security issues:

 1. Insecure storage of certificates (Line 141, 181, 184): The code uses
    QSettings to store the path of the APN certificate. Storing sensitive
    information like certificate paths in plaintext using QSettings is insecure.
    If an attacker gains access to the user's system, they could retrieve the
    certificate path and potentially misuse it.
    
    Solution: Store the certificate in a secure manner, such as using a secure
    credential storage system provided by the operating system or encrypting the
    certificate path before storing it.

 2. SSL/TLS configuration (Line 174): Setting the peerVerifyMode to
    QSslSocket::VerifyNone disables peer certificate validation. While this
    might be acceptable for development or testing purposes, it should not be
    used in production code as it exposes the application to potential
    Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
    
    Solution: Use proper peer verification mechanisms, such as
    QSslSocket::VerifyPeer or QSslSocket::VerifyPeerCertificate, to ensure the
    authenticity of the server.

 3. Memory management (Line 78, 72): The code creates new QStandardItem objects
    without managing their memory explicitly. This can lead to memory leaks if
    the items are not properly deleted when they are no longer needed.
    
    Solution: Use smart pointers (e.g., std::unique_ptr) or ensure that the
    created QStandardItem objects are deleted when they are no longer needed.

 4. Error handling (Line 106, 113, 115, 153, 163): The code lacks robust error
    handling for fi
