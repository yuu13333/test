Upon analyzing the original code, a few potential security concerns can be
identified:

 1. Potential XSS Vulnerability: The code constructs HTTP response headers
    directly from user-controlled data without proper sanitization. This could
    potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if the user-supplied
    data contains malicious content.
    
    * Line numbers: 140-153
    * Issue: The headersReceived function parses and processes headers received
      from the server. If these headers are later used in constructing HTML or
      JavaScript content without proper escaping, it can lead to XSS
      vulnerabilities.
    * Solution: Ensure that any user-supplied data used to construct HTTP
      headers is properly sanitized and escaped before being included in HTML or
      JavaScript content. Use appropriate encoding functions (e.g., HTML
      escaping) to prevent script injection.

 2. Untrusted Data Handling: The code directly processes and manipulates data
    received from the server without sufficient validation. This can lead to
    various security vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows or data
    injection attacks.
    
    * Line numbers: 155-176, 405-421
    * Issue: The q_readBinary function processes binary data received from the
      server without adequate validation. This data is then directly processed
      and appended to internal buffers without sufficient checks, potentially
      leading to buffer overflow or other data manipulation vulnerabilities.
    * Solution: Implement strict validation checks on the size and format of
      incoming binary data t
