Security Defects:

1. CWE-697: Insufficient Comparison (Logical)
   - Description: The code uses an insufficient comparison operation, potentially leading to logical errors.
   - Line Number: 63
   - The `self._resize_and_assert_error` method compares `dest_host` directly with `'host2'`. While this might work for the current test scenario, it's better to avoid hardcoding values like this as it might introduce logical errors in future changes or variations of the test environment.
   - Solution: Parameterize the comparison or use a more flexible approach to handle host comparison.

2. CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
   - Description: The code lacks proper handling of exceptional conditions.
   - Line Number: 50
   - In the `_resize_and_assert_error` method, there's an assertion that checks for a specific error message. However, this might not cover all possible exceptional conditions that could occur during the finish resize process.
   - Solution: Implement more comprehensive error handling to cover various exceptional conditions that might arise during the resize process.

3. CWE-570: Expression is Always False
   - Description: The code contains an expression that will always evaluate to false.
   - Line Number: 69
   - There's a comment indicating a known issue (bug 1825537) where allocations are reverted when finish_resize fails, but the corresponding assertion is commented out.
   - Solution: Either remove the dead code or uncomment and address the issue.

No security defects are detected in the code.
