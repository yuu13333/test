There are several security issues in the provided code:

 1. Command Injection (Lines 107, 133, 138, 143): The properties export_ports,
    get_image_name, get_server_name, and get_host_name are building shell
    commands using string interpolation without proper sanitization. This can
    lead to command injection vulnerabilities if untrusted input is passed to
    these methods.
    
    Solution: Use proper shell escaping or safer alternatives like subprocess to
    execute commands.

 2. Potential Shell Injection (Line 153): The docker_build function constructs a
    shell command by joining strings. If any of the strings in base_file or
    config.docker_file contain user-controlled data, it could lead to shell
    injection vulnerabilities.
    
    Solution: Avoid building shell commands by joining strings. Instead, use
    subprocess or shell-safe APIs.

 3. Hardcoded Credentials (Lines 6-38): The license headers contain contact
    information and URLs to licensing agreements. While not necessarily a direct
    security threat, hardcoded credentials or URLs can sometimes leak sensitive
    information or provide attackers with additional attack vectors.
    
    Solution: Remove or abstract out sensitive information from the code,
    especially if it's not required for functionality.

 4. Deprecated Python 2 (Line 1): The shebang #!/usr/bin/env python2 indicates
    that the script is intended for Python 2, which reached its end of life in
    January 2020. Continuing to use Python 2 may expose the application to
    security vulnerabilities and deprive it of security patches and updates.
    
    Solution: Migrate the codebase to Python 3, which is actively maintained and
    receives security updates.

 5. Use of has_key (Lines 99, 102): The has_key method is deprecated in Python 2
    and removed in Python 3. Its usage can lead to potential compatibility
    issues and makes the code harder to maintain.
    
    Solution: Replace has_key with the in operator to check for the presence of
    keys in dictionaries.

 6. Incomplete Error Handling (Lines 162, 180): Error messages from subprocess
    calls are printed to stdout without proper handling. This could lead to
    information leakage and potential security risks if sensitive information is
    printed.
    
    Solution: Implement proper error handling for subprocess calls, including
    logging or handling specific error cases.

 7. Unnecessary Commented Code (Line 185): The comment "Note:" is followed by
    commented-out code. While not a security issue, commented-out code can
    clutter the codebase and make it harder to read and maintain.
    
    Solution: Remove unnecessary commented-out code.

 8. Potential Information Disclosure (Lines 156, 176, 198): The docker build,
    docker run, and docker exec commands execute with -quiet or -d options,
    which suppress output. Suppressing output can make it harder to detect
    errors or troubleshoot issues, potentially leading to information disclosure
    if errors occur silently.
    
    Solution: Ensure that error messages and relevant information are properly
    logged or handled, even when using quiet or background execution options.

Overall, the codebase needs improvements in terms of security practices, error
handling, and compatibility with modern Python versions.
