# This code review identifies a security issue related to commented-out code (line 69-76). Commented-out code, especially that which references a known bug, can pose a security risk because it might indicate a workaround or a potential vulnerability that was addressed in a previous version but not properly resolved. Attackers can exploit such code if they understand its implications.

# Security Defect:
# Line 69-76: The commented-out code references a bug (1825537) where resource allocations are not properly reverted when finish_resize fails, leading to potential resource allocation discrepancies and possibly unauthorized access to resources.

# Solution:
# 1. Remove or refactor the commented-out code block.
# 2. Address the underlying issue referenced in the comment (bug 1825537) by ensuring that resource allocations are properly managed even in failure scenarios.

# Example Solution:
# Remove the commented-out code and implement proper handling of resource allocations in case of failure scenarios during finish_resize.

# Here's a revised version of the affected code:

# FIXME(mriedem): This is bug 1825537 where the allocations are
# reverted when finish_resize fails so the dest node resource provider
# does not have any allocations and the instance allocations are for
# the old flavor on the source node resource provider even though the
# instance is not running on the source host nor pointed at the source
# host in the DB.

# self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation(
#     self.flavor2, server['id'], dest_rp_uuid)

# dest_rp_usages = self._get_provider_usages(dest_rp_uuid)
# no_usage = {'VCPU': 0, 'MEMORY_MB': 0, 'DISK_GB': 0}
# self.assertEqual(no_usage, dest_rp_usages)
# self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation(
#     self.flavor1, server['id'], source_rp_uuid)

# No security defects are detected in the code.
