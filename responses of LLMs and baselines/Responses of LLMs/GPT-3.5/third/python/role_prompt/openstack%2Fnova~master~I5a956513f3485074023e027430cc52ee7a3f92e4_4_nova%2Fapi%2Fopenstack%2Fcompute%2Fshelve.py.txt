Line 20: The import statement "from nova.api.openstack import wsgi" imports the
entire wsgi module, which may include unnecessary functionality and increase the
attack surface. Instead, import only the necessary classes or functions from the
module to reduce potential security risks.

No security defects are detected in the code.
