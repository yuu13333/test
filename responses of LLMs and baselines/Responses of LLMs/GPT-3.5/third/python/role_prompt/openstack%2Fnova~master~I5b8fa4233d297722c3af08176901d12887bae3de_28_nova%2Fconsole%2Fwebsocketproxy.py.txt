The code seems generally well-written, but I've identified a few potential
security concerns:

 1. Potential Command Injection (Line 152): In the
    NovaProxyRequestHandler.new_websocket_client method, the code constructs an
    HTTP CONNECT request using user-controlled data
    (connect_info['internal_access_path']). This could potentially lead to
    command injection if connect_info['internal_access_path'] is not properly
    sanitized. To mitigate this, ensure that any user-controlled input is
    properly validated and sanitized before constructing the HTTP request.

 2. Potential HTTP Response Splitting (Line 152): Similar to the previous issue,
    constructing an HTTP CONNECT request using user-controlled data
    (connect_info['internal_access_path']) without proper validation could lead
    to HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities. Ensure that any user input is
    properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious input from causing
    unexpected behavior.

 3. Incomplete Cookie Parsing (Lines 93-104): The code attempts to parse cookies
    from the Cookie header using Python's SimpleCookie module. However, it
    doesn't handle all possible cases, and malformed cookies could potentially
    lead to security vulnerabilities. Consider using a more robust cookie
    parsing library or implementing additional checks to handle edge cases and
    ensure proper cookie parsing.

 4. Insecure Cookie Handling (Lines 93-104): While parsing cookies, the code
    logs a warning if a malformed cookie is encountered. However, it's generally
    not recommended to log potentially sensitive information like cookie data,
    even if it's malformed, as it could aid attackers in crafting malicious
    requests. Instead of logging the cookie content, consider logging a generic
    warning message without revealing the cookie data.

 5. Insufficient Input Validation (Lines 126-137): The code validates the Origin
    header to ensure it matches an expected value. However, it only checks the
    hostname part (origin_hostname) and the scheme (origin_scheme) of the Origin
    header. This could potentially allow attackers to bypass origin validation
    by using a valid hostname with an unexpected scheme. Consider performing
    more thorough validation of the Origin header to ensure both the hostname
    and scheme match the expected values.

 6. Insecure Proxying (Lines 164-168): The code catches exceptions that occur
    during proxying (self.do_proxy(tsock)), but it doesn't handle them securely.
    Depending on the exception, this could potentially allow attackers to
    disrupt the proxying process or cause other unexpected behavior. Ensure that
    exceptions are handled securely, and consider logging detailed error
    messages for debugging purposes without revealing sensitive information.

 7. Missing Content-Length Check (Lines 156-160): When parsing the response to
    the HTTP CONNECT request, the code checks for the end of the response
    headers (data.find("\r\n\r\n")). However, it doesn't verify the
    Content-Length header to ensure that the response body matches the expected
    length. This could potentially allow attackers to manipulate the response
    body, leading to security vulnerabilities. Consider adding a check to verify
    the Content-Length header and ensure that the response body matches the
    expected length.

To address these issues:

 * Implement proper input validation and sanitization for user-controlled data.
 * Use a more secure method for parsing cookies, and avoid logging potentially
   sensitive information.
 * Perform thorough validation of the Origin header to prevent bypassing origin
   validation.
 * Handle exceptions securely and avoid revealing sensitive information in error
   messages.
 * Ensure proper verification of response headers, including the Content-Length
   header, to prevent manipulation of response data.

Once these issues are addressed, the code should be more resilient to security
vulnerabilities.
