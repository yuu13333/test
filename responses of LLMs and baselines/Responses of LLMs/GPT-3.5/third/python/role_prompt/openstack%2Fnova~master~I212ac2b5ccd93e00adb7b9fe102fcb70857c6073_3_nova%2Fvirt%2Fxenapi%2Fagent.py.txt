# SECURITY REVIEW

# Line 43: USE_AGENT_KEY and SKIP_SSH_KEY are defined as constants but `utils` is not imported. It may cause NameError if utils is used without being imported.
# Line 44: `SKIP_SSH_SM_KEY` is defined as `utils.SM_IMAGE_PROP_PREFIX + SKIP_SSH_KEY`, but `utils` is not imported. It may cause NameError if utils is used without being imported.
# Line 47: `SKIP_FILES_AT_BOOT_SM_KEY` is defined as `utils.SM_IMAGE_PROP_PREFIX + SKIP_FILES_AT_BOOT_KEY`, but `utils` is not imported. It may cause NameError if utils is used without being imported.
# Line 66: `dom_id` is fetched without checking whether `vm_ref` is valid or not. It may cause XenAPI.Failure if `vm_ref` is invalid.
# Line 79: An unhandled exception `XenAPI.Failure` may leak sensitive information about the system, like method name, arguments, etc.
# Line 84: An unhandled exception `XenAPI.Failure` may leak sensitive information about the system, like method name, arguments, etc.
# Line 90: An unhandled exception `XenAPI.Failure` may leak sensitive information about the system, like method name, arguments, etc.
# Line 102: `ret` is directly loaded with `jsonutils.loads(ret)` without any validation. It may raise exceptions if `ret` is not a valid JSON string.
# Line 110: `ret` is directly loaded with `jsonutils.loads(ret)` without any validation. It may raise exceptions if `ret` is not a valid JSON string.
# Line 145: `version.LooseVersion` is used without importing it. It may cause NameError if `version` is not imported.
# Line 203: `Agent` is accessed without importing `objects`. It may cause NameError if `objects` is not imported.
# Line 330: `resetnetwork` method calls `_call_agent` without specifying `success_codes` and `ignore_errors`. It may not handle agent errors appropriately.
# Line 335: `_skip_ssh_key_inject` method accesses `utils` without importing it. It may cause NameError if `utils` is not imported.
# Line 338: `_skip_inject_files_at_boot` method accesses `utils` without importing it. It may cause NameError if `utils` is not imported.
# Line 342: `_get_sys_meta_key` method accesses `utils` without importing it. It may cause NameError if `utils` is not imported.
# Line 378: `should_use_agent` method accesses `utils` without importing it. It may cause NameError if `utils` is not imported.

# Overall, the code lacks some import statements and proper exception handling in certain places. Additionally, there are potential issues related to accessing undefined variables and methods. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the code's correctness and security.
