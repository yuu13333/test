After reviewing the provided code, there are a few potential security defects
that need to be addressed. Here are the issues identified along with their
solutions:

 1. Cookie Handling and Security (Line 91-105):
    
    * The code splits and parses cookies from the 'cookie' header manually. If
      there's a malformed cookie, it might not be handled properly or securely.
      There's a risk of cookie injection or other issues related to cookie
      parsing.
    * Solution: Instead of manually splitting and parsing the cookies, use the
      Cookie.SimpleCookie directly on the full hcookie string and handle
      exceptions more securely to ensure robustness.

 2. Origin Header Validation (Line 116-138):
    
    * The origin validation checks the hostname but does not consider different
      ways a header could be manipulated, such as using punycode or unicode
      characters to spoof similar-looking domain names.
    * Solution: Use a more rigorous method for validating the origin header.
      Implement additional checks against a list of allowed domains and possibly
      convert all hostnames to their ASCII form using a library that can handle
      such conversions safely, to prevent homograph attacks.

 3. Error Handling During WebSocket Proxy Connection (Line 148-171):
    
    * There is a potential issue where if the connection to the target fails or
      is not valid (checked in lines 155-160), the proxy might still proceed to
      other operations. The check at line 157 only looks for "200" in the first
      line which could be bypassed with a specifically crafted response.
    * Solution: Improve the validation of the response in the handshake. Ensure
      that the response strictly follows the expected HTTP format and returns a
      proper status code. Consider using a more robust method or library to
      handle HTTP responses.

 4. Token Validation and Exposure (Line 106-112):
    
    * The token from the query is validated and an exception is raised if it is
      not found or invalid, but there might be insufficient logging of failed
      validation attempts, which could help in monitoring and identifying
      potential abuse or attacks.
    * Solution: Implement logging of all token validation failures with
      sufficient details for audits while ensuring sensitive information (like
      the token itself) is not logged. Ensure the error messages do not expose
      sensitive information either.

 5. Use of Deprecated Libraries (Line 26, Line 27):
    
    * The code uses the six library which is intended to help write code
      compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3. As Python 2 has reached the
      end of its life, maintaining compatibility may no longer be necessary and
      could potentially introduce vulnerabilities associated with outdated code.
    * Solution: Consider removing dependencies on six and updating the codebase
      to use Python 3 features directly.

By addressing these issues, the code can be made more secure and robust,
reducing the risk of exploits and ensuring better adherence to security best
practices.
