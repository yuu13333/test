# Security Defects Detection and Solutions:

# 1. Potential Code Injection in Command Execution:
#    - Issue: The code executes shell commands without proper input validation or sanitization, which could lead to command injection attacks.
#    - Line: 62, 64, 82, 87, 95, 97
#    - Solution: Use subprocess module's `subprocess.run()` with `shell=False` and pass arguments as a list rather than a string to avoid command injection vulnerabilities.

# 2. Lack of Input Validation in File Paths:
#    - Issue: The code doesn't validate the input file paths, which could lead to path traversal attacks.
#    - Line: 82, 85, 87, 91, 95, 97, 114
#    - Solution: Validate and sanitize file paths using functions like `os.path.abspath()` to ensure they point to expected locations.

# 3. Lack of Proper Exception Handling:
#    - Issue: Lack of specific exception handling might expose sensitive information or lead to unexpected behaviors.
#    - Line: 98, 103, 119, 122, 126, 131, 170, 176
#    - Solution: Implement specific exception handling for different scenarios and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

# 4. Lack of Secure Configuration:
#    - Issue: Security-sensitive configurations are hardcoded or not securely managed.
#    - Line: 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 72, 138, 144, 146, 147, 148, 150, 181
#    - Solution: Store sensitive configurations securely, avoid hardcoded credentials or paths, and utilize secure methods for configuration management.

# 5. Lack of Input Validation in Mount and Unmount Functions:
#    - Issue: The `mount_volume()` and `umount_volume()` functions do not validate input parameters, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
#    - Line: 73, 91
#    - Solution: Implement input validation checks to ensure that only expected values are processed to prevent exploitation.

# 6. Lack of Authentication and Authorization:
#    - Issue: The code does not include mechanisms for authentication and authorization, potentially allowing unauthorized access to resources.
#    - Line: N/A
#    - Solution: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive operations and resources.

# 7. Lack of Logging:
#    - Issue: Inadequate or missing logging can hinder security incident detection and response.
#    - Line: 33, 71, 83, 85, 88, 98, 103, 123, 127, 130, 170, 176, 195, 197
#    - Solution: Implement comprehensive logging including success, failure, and exception cases to aid in security monitoring and analysis.

# 8. Insecure Randomness Source:
#    - Issue: The code does not utilize a secure source of randomness for generating cryptographic material or sensitive values.
#    - Line: N/A
#    - Solution: Use cryptographically secure random number generators like `os.urandom()` for generating sensitive values.

# 9. Lack of SSL/TLS for Secure Communication:
#    - Issue: The code may transmit sensitive data over unencrypted channels, risking interception and tampering.
#    - Line: N/A
#    - Solution: Implement SSL/TLS for secure communication, especially when transferring sensitive data over networks.

# 10. Lack of Data Encryption:
#    - Issue: The code does not incorporate encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data at rest or in transit.
#    - Line: N/A
#    - Solution: Implement encryption for sensitive data to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

# No security defects are detected in the code.
