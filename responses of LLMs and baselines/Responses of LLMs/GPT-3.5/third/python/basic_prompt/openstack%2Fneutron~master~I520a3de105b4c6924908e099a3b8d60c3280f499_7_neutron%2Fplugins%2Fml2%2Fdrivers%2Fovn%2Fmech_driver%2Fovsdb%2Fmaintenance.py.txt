Line 6: The license URL provided is incorrect. It should be updated to the correct Apache License 2.0 URL.
Line 103: Accessing a private attribute directly may lead to unintended behavior. Instead of accessing `_nb_idl` directly, consider using a public method or property if available.
Line 137: Setting a lock using private methods `_idl.set_lock()` might not be the intended way and can potentially lead to issues. Consider using a public method if available or revisiting the design to ensure proper locking mechanisms.
Line 180: Inconsistent resource handling in the `_resources_func_map` dictionary can lead to unauthorized access or unintended behavior. Ensure that only valid resources are being accessed.
Line 202: Lack of proper locking mechanism while executing the `nbdb_schema_updated_hook()` method could result in race conditions leading to inconsistent behavior. Ensure proper locking mechanisms are implemented.
Line 283: The migration task `migrate_to_port_groups()` is set to run every 10 seconds, which might be too frequent and resource-intensive. Consider adjusting the spacing or finding a more efficient trigger mechanism.
Line 298: Directly creating an instance of `OvnNbSynchronizer` without proper error handling could lead to potential exceptions being unhandled. Ensure proper error handling mechanisms are in place.
Line 332: Lack of proper locking mechanism while executing the `check_for_inconsistencies()` method could result in race conditions leading to inconsistent behavior. Ensure proper locking mechanisms are implemented.
Line 402: Lack of proper locking mechanism while executing the `_check_subnet_global_dhcp_opts()` method could result in race conditions leading to inconsistent behavior. Ensure proper locking mechanisms are implemented.
Line 446: Lack of proper locking mechanism while executing the `check_global_dhcp_opts()` method could result in race conditions leading to inconsistent behavior. Ensure proper locking mechanisms are implemented.
Line 477: Lack of proper locking mechanism while executing the `check_metadata_ports()` method could result in race conditions leading to inconsistent behavior. Ensure proper locking mechanisms are implemented.
Line 486: Lack of proper locking mechanism while executing the `check_for_port_security_unknown_address()` method could result in race conditions leading to inconsistent behavior. Ensure proper locking mechanisms are implemented.
Line 522: Lack of proper locking mechanism while executing the `check_for_fragmentation_support()` method could result in race conditions leading to inconsistent behavior. Ensure proper locking mechanisms are implemented.
