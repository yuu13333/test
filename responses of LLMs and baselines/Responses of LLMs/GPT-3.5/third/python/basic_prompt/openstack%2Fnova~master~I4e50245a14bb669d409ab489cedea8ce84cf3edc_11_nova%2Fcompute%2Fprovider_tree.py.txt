Security Defect:

The method inventory_changed() does not sanitize its input. If an attacker
passes a string that does not correspond to a valid provider's name or UUID, it
can result in a ValueError being raised, leaking information about the existence
of a provider with the given name or UUID. This information disclosure could be
used by an attacker to infer the internal structure of the provider tree,
potentially aiding further attacks.

Solution:

To mitigate this issue, ensure that the input name_or_uuid is properly validated
before performing any sensitive operations. You can validate it against a
whitelist of allowed provider names or UUIDs before attempting to retrieve the
provider object. If the input does not match any valid provider, handle the case
gracefully without leaking information about the internal structure.
Additionally, consider logging such occurrences for monitoring and debugging
purposes.
