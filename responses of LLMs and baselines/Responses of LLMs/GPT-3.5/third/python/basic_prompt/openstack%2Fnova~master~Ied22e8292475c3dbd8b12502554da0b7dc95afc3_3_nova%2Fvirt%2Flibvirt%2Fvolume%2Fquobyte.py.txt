Line 48: Insecure Command Injection
    The code checks if "/run/systemd/system" directory exists to determine if systemd is present. However, this check can be bypassed by creating a symbolic link to this directory, leading to a command injection vulnerability.
    Solution: Instead of checking for the existence of the directory, it's safer to directly check if systemd is running using a more robust method.

Line 89: Path Traversal
    The code constructs an error message with user-controlled data (mnt_base), which could lead to a path traversal vulnerability if an attacker manipulates this value to escape the intended directory.
    Solution: Ensure that mnt_base is properly sanitized before constructing the error message.

Line 87: Weak Permission Check
    The code checks if the mount path is writable but does not check execute permissions. This could allow an attacker to execute files in the mounted directory if permissions are not appropriately set.
    Solution: Check for both write and execute permissions on the mount path.

Line 113 and Line 139: Missing Locking Mechanism
    The connect_volume and disconnect_volume methods lack proper locking mechanisms, which could lead to race conditions when multiple threads try to access these methods concurrently.
    Solution: Implement proper locking mechanisms, such as using threading.Lock or other synchronization primitives, to ensure thread safety.

Line 102: Missing Key Existence Check
    The code assumes that 'format' key exists in the 'data' dictionary without checking its existence, which could lead to a KeyError if the key is missing.
    Solution: Add a check to ensure that the 'format' key exists before accessing it.
