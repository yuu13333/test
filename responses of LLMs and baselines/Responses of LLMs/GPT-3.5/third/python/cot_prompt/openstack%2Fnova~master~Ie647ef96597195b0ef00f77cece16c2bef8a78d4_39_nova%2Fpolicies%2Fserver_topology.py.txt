The original code provided seems to primarily focus on defining policies and
rules for accessing the server topology information API. However, there are some
considerations regarding security that can be highlighted:

 1. Lack of Input Validation: The code does not perform input validation on the
    server_id parameter received in the API endpoints. Without proper
    validation, this could potentially lead to various security vulnerabilities
    such as SQL injection or path traversal attacks.
    
    Line Number: Lines 28, 39
    
    Security Defect: Lack of input validation could allow an attacker to
    manipulate the server_id parameter to access or modify data belonging to
    other servers, leading to information disclosure or unauthorized actions.
    
    Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the server_id parameter
    is of the expected format and corresponds to a valid server identifier. This
    can be achieved using regular expressions or by checking against a whitelist
    of allowed characters.

 2. Error Handling: Proper error handling is crucial in preventing information
    leakage and maintaining the confidentiality of the system. The code lacks
    detailed error handling, which might expose sensitive information or provide
    attackers with insights into the system's internal workings.
    
    Line Number: Lines 33, 44
    
    Security Defect: In case of errors, the code does not differentiate between
    various failure scenarios, potentially leaking information about the
    system's state to attackers. Moreover, it might not provide meaningful error
    messages to legitimate users, hindering troubleshooting efforts.
    
    Solution: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to catch and handle
    different types of errors gracefully. Use generic error messages for
    responses sent to clients to avoid leaking sensitive information. Log
    detailed error messages internally for troubleshooting purposes.

 3. Authorization Logic: While the code checks for permissions using the
    context.can() function, it's crucial to ensure that the authorization logic
    is correctly implemented and comprehensive. In complex systems, overlooking
    certain permissions or mi
