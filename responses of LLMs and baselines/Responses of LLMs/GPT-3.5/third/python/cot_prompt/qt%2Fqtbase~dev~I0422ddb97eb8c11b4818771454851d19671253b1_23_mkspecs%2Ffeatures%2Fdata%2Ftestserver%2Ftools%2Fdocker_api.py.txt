The original code provided seems to focus on building Docker containers for test
servers and managing their lifecycle. Here's an analysis for security defects:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability:
    
    * Location: docker_build() function, line 155.
    * Description: The docker build command is constructed by concatenating
      strings without proper sanitization. This can lead to command injection
      vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated.
    * Solution: Instead of constructing the command using string concatenation,
      use safer methods like passing arguments directly to the Popen function or
      using a dedicated library for interacting with Docker, which handles
      command execution securely.

 2. Environment Variable Usage:
    
    * Location: export_ports() function, line 99.
    * Description: The code checks for the existence of an environment variable
      (TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL) using os.environ.has_key(), which is deprecated.
      This might lead to confusion as it's recommended to use in operator or
      get() method on dictionaries.
    * Solution: Replace os.environ.has_key() with in operator or use get()
      method to check for the existence of the environment variable.

 3. Potential Shell Injection:
    
    * Location: copy_commands() function, line 112.
    * Description: The open() function is used to read files for copying into
      the Docker container. If copy_file.src is controlled by an attacker, it
      could lead to arbitrary file read vulnerability or even shell injection.
    * Solution: Ensure that copy_file.src is pr
