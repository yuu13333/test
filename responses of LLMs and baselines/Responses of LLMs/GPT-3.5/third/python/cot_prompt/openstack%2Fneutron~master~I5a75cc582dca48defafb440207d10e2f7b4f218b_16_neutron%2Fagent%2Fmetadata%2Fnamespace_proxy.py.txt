The original code seems to be well-structured and follows best practices for
security. However, there are a few potential security concerns that should be
addressed:

 1. File Permissions and Ownership (Line 77-95): When creating the configuration
    file for HAProxy, the code retrieves the username and groupname associated
    with the provided user and group IDs using pwd.getpwuid() and grp.getgrgid()
    functions. However, if the provided user or group ID does not exist on the
    system, the code falls back to using the provided IDs directly. This can
    lead to potential security issues if the user or group is misconfigured or
    does not exist, as it may result in file ownership or permission issues.
    
    * Security Defect: Improper file ownership or permissions can lead to
      unauthorized access or manipulation of critical system files.
    * Solution: Validate the existence of the provided user and group IDs before
      using them. If the user or group does not exist, log an error and exit
      gracefully, or fallback to a default user or group.
