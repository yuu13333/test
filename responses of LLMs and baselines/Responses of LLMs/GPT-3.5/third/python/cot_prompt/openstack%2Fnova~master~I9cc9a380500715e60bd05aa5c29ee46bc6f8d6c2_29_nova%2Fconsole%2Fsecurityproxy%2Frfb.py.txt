Based on the original code provided, here are some potential security defects
and their corresponding solutions:

 1. Potential information leakage in exception messages:
    
    * Line number: 93, 103, 114, 153
    * Defect: Exception messages may reveal sensitive information about the
      system, such as the RFB protocol version being used. This information
      could be used by attackers to tailor their attacks.
    * Solution: Ensure that exception messages do not disclose sensitive
      information. Instead, provide a generic error message or log the detailed
      error information for internal debugging purposes only.

 2. Potential buffer overflow in _make_var_str method:
    
    * Line number: 54, 57
    * Defect: The _make_var_str method calculates the length of the message
      bytes and creates a message_len variable using struct.pack("!I",
      len(message_bytes)). However, if the length of the message is greater than
      the maximum value that can be represented by a 4-byte unsigned integer, it
      could lead to a buffer overflow.
    * Solution: Ensure that the length of the message is within the bounds of a
      4-byte unsigned integer before calculating the message_len variable. This
      can be done by validating the length of the message before packing it.

 3. Potential insecure handling of socket data:
    
    * Line number: 87, 89, 109, 121, 122, 123, 124, 131, 133, 154, 171, 174,
      178, 182
    * Defect: The code uses `socket.rec
