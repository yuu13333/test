Here's an analysis of the original code for potential security defects:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability:
    
    * Line 62: In the is_systemd() function, the processutils.execute() function
      is used to run the systemctl command. If unsanitized user input is passed
      to this function, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
    * Solution: Use parameterized commands or ensure that any user input passed
      to processutils.execute() is properly sanitized.
