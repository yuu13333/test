In the provided code, there are a few potential security concerns:

 1. Use of Hardcoded Path for Key File: In the _ssh_check method, a hardcoded
    path is used to create a temporary key file (key_file_path =
    '/tmp/testkey.dat'). Hardcoding paths can lead to security risks, especially
    if the file contains sensitive information like private keys. An attacker
    could potentially exploit this by creating or manipulating files in the /tmp
    directory.
    
    * Line Number: Line 117
    * Solution: Instead of using a hardcoded path, it's better to generate a
      temporary file in a secure directory with appropriate permissions.
      Python's tempfile module can be used to achieve this securely.

 2. Potential Command Injection: In the _ssh_check method, subprocess is used to
    execute a shell command (subprocess.call(all_cmd, shell=True, ...)). This
    could lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the namespace variable
    contains user-controlled input.
    
    * Line Number: Lines 122-132
    * Solution: It's recommended to avoid using shell=True with subprocess,
      especially when dealing with user input. Instead, split the command into a
      list of arguments and pass it directly to subprocess without involving the
      shell.

 3. Insecure File Permissions: In the _ssh_check method, the temporary key file
    is created with default permissions, which might not be secure depending on
    the environment.
    
    * Line Number: Lines 124-135
    * Solution: Explicitly set restrictive permissions (e.g., read/write for
      owner only) on the temporary key file to ensure that it's not accessible
      to unauthorized users.

Addressing these concerns will enhance the security posture of the code.

In summary:

No security defects are detected in the code
