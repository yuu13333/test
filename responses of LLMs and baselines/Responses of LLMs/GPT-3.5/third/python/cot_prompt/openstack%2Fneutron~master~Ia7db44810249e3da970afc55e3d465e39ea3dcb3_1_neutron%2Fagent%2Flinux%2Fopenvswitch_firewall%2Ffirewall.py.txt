The original code doesn't seem to have any blatant security defects, but there
are areas where security could be improved or potential issues could arise:

 1. Input Sanitization: The code interacts with network packets and
    configurations. It's essential to ensure that all inputs, especially those
    coming from external sources, are properly sanitized to prevent injection
    attacks or unexpected behavior. For example, input parameters like port_name
    in the get_tag_from_other_config function (line 58) should be sanitized to
    avoid injection attacks.

 2. Error Handling: While error handling is present in some parts of the code,
    it's not comprehensive. There are several places where exceptions are
    caught, but the error messages are not very informative. It's crucial to
    provide meaningful error messages without exposing sensitive information to
    assist with debugg
