The original code appears to be generally well-structured and follows best
practices. However, there are a few potential security concerns that should be
addressed:

 1. SQL Injection Risk (Line 82, 106, 116, 118, 136, 139, 146, 149, 157, 166,
    170, 174, 178, 181, 184, 186, 189, 190, 191, 193, 211, 235, 238, 326, 334,
    340, 342, 344, 350, 353, 362, 364, 369, 371, 378, 386, 394, 399, 405, 409,
    411): SQL queries are constructed using string concatenation or formatting,
    which can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if input
    parameters are not properly sanitized. It's recommended to use parameterized
    queries or ORM libraries like SQLAlchemy to mitigate this risk.
    
    Solution: Use parameterized queries or ORM libraries to ensure that user
    input is properly sanitized before constructing SQL queries. For example,
    instead of:
    
    python
    复制代码
    query = context.session.query(model).filter_by(project_id=project_id)
    
    
    Use:
    
    python
    复制代码
    query = context.session.query(model).filter(model.project_id == project_id)
    

 2. Error Handling (Multiple Lines): In some parts of the code, exceptions are
    raised but not properly handled. For instance, in methods like _get_from_db,
    _get_all_from_db, _get_class_from_db, _update_class_in_db,
    _destroy_all_in_db_by_project, and _destroy_all_in_db_by_project_and_user, e
