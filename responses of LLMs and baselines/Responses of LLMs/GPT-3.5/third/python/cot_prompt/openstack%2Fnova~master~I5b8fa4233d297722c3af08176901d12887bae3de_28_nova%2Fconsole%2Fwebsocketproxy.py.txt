In the original code, I've identified one potential security issue:

 1. Sensitive Information Exposure (Line 142):
    * Description: The connect_info dictionary containing sensitive information
      (e.g., token) is being logged directly in clear text using the self.msg
      method.
    * Risk: This exposes sensitive information to anyone who can access the
      logs, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
    * Line Number: 142
    * Solution: Mask the sensitive information before logging. This can be done
      using a method like strutils.mask_password provided by oslo_utils. This
      will ensure that only masked versions of sensitive information are logged,
      reducing the risk of exposure.

To fix this issue, you can modify the logging statement as follows:

python
Copy code
self.msg(_('connect info: %s'), str(strutils.mask_password(str(connect_info), secret)))


This change will ensure that the token and other sensitive information in
connect_info are masked before being logged.
