Upon analyzing the original code, I didn't detect any explicit security defects.
However, here are some general best practices to enhance security in the
codebase:

 1. Input Validation: Ensure that all inputs from external sources, such as user
    inputs or network data, are properly validated to prevent injection attacks
    or unexpected behavior. While the code appears to handle inputs correctly,
    it's essential to maintain vigilance in this area throughout the codebase.

 2. Sensitive Data Handling: Double-check how sensitive data such as passwords,
    API keys, or tokens are handled. Make sure they are not hardcoded in the
    code and are stored securely, preferably using environment variables or a
    secure key management system.

 3. Privilege Escalation: Review any areas where the code interacts with system
    resources or executes commands with elevated privileges. Ensure that proper
    checks are in place to prevent unauthorized access or potential privilege
    escalation attacks.

 4. Error Handling: Verify that error handling mechanisms are robust and do not
    reveal sensitive information to attackers. Error messages should be
    informative to developers but not disclose system details to potential
    attackers.

 5. Secure Communication: If the application communicates over a network, ensure
    that it uses secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) and implements proper encryption
    and authentication mechanisms to protect data in transit.

 6. Code Injection: Guard against code injection vulnerabilities such as SQL
    injection, OS command injection, or code injection in dynamic languages. Use
    parameterized queries for database operations and validate and sanitize all
    inputs before using them in dynamic code execution.

 7. Access Controls: Review access control mechanisms to ensure that sensitive
    resources are protected from unauthorized access. Implement principle of
    least privilege, ensuring that each component or user has only the
    permissions necessary to perform their tasks.

 8. Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to
    identify and address any potential security issues proactively.

If these aspects are already covered appropriately in the broader codebase and
