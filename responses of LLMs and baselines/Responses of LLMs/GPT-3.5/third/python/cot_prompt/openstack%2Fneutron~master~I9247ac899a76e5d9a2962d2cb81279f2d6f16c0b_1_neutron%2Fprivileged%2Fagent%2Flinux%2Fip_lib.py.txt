The original code appears to be generally well-structured and follows best
practices for handling network-related operations. However, there are a few
areas where potential security concerns could be addressed:

 1. Error Handling in delete_ip_address Function:
    
    * Security Concern: The delete_ip_address function currently catches
      NetlinkError exceptions and checks if the error code is
      errno.EADDRNOTAVAIL, indicating that the IP address doesn't exist.
      However, this approach might suppress other genuine errors that could
      potentially indicate security issues or system misconfiguration.
    * Line Number: Lines 162-169
    * Solution: Instead of catching NetlinkError indiscriminately, it's better
      to handle specific error conditions more explicitly. Depending on the
      requirements, it might be appropriate to log unexpected errors or raise
      custom exceptions for better error reporting and handling.

 2. Namespace Validation in Various Functions:
    
    * Security Concern: Several functions accept a namespace parameter without
      proper validation. If an attacker supplies a malicious or non-existent
      namespace, it could lead to unexpected behavior or denial of service.
    * Line Numbers: Lines 54, 139, 173, 183, 186, 197, 203, 211, 217, 219, 229,
      241, 263, 269, 297, 311
    * Solution: Validate the namespace input against a whitelist of allowed
      namespaces or ensure that the namespace exists before performing
      operations within it. Additionally, consider limiting the privileges of
      the namespace if it's user-supplied.

 3. Potential Information Disclosure:
    
    * Security Concern: The get_routing_table function provides information
      about routes, including destination CIDRs and next hops. While this might
      be necessary for certain operations, exposing this information could
      potentially aid attackers in mapping the network topology and planning
      attacks.
    * Line Numbers: Lines 54-80
    * Solution: Evaluate whether exposing routing table information is necessary
      for the application's functionality. If not, consider restricting access
      to this information
