Upon analyzing the original code, I've identified a potential security concern
related to the usage of the utils.execute function for executing shell commands
with elevated privileges. Let's break it down:

Security Defect:

 * Potential Command Injection: In lines 122 and 146, the utils.execute function
   is used to execute shell commands (mount and umount) with the
   run_as_root=True parameter, indicating that these commands will be executed
   with elevated privileges. However, the commands are constructed by
   concatenating strings, which can potentially lead to command injection
   vulnerabilities if untrusted input is passed to these commands.

Line Number: 122, 146

Solution:

 * To mitigate command injection vulnerabilities, it's recommended to use a
   safer alternative like subprocess.Popen with proper argument passing. This
   involves passing command arguments as separate items in a list rather than
   concatenating strings. Additionally, ensure that any user input or dynamic
   data is properly sanitized or validated before being used to construct shell
   commands.

Here's how the solution might look:

python
Copy code
import subprocess

# For mount command
mount_cmd = ['mount', '-t', fstype]
if options is not None:
    mount_cmd.extend(options)
mount_cmd.extend([export, mountpoint])

subprocess.Popen(mount_cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=False)

# For umount command
subprocess.Popen(['umount', mountpoint], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=False)


By using subprocess.Popen with a list of arguments, we ensure that each argumen
