Here's an analysis of the original code for potential security defects:

 1. Potential SQL Injection:
    
    * Line 71: The objects.InstanceMapping.get_by_instance_uuid() method is
      called with meta_data.uuid directly without any sanitization. If the uuid
      parameter is not properly sanitized, it could lead to SQL injection
      vulnerabilities.
    * Solution: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods that automatically
      sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection. For example, in SQLAlchemy, you
      can use parameter binding to ensure inputs are properly sanitized.

 2. Potential Information Disclosure:
    
    * Line 79: When updating the instance.system_metadata, there's no check to
      ensure that the request body contains only valid data. If an attacker can
      manipulate the request body to include arbitrary data, it could lead to
      unauthorized modification of system metadata.
    * Solution: Validate the contents of the request body to ensure it only
      contains the necessary data and nothing else. Implement proper
      authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only authorized
      users can modify system metadata.

 3. Password Handling:
    
    * Line 32-38, 41-54: The extract_password() and convert_password() functions
      handle password extraction and conversion. However, storing passwords in
      system metadata might not be the most secure approach, depending on the
      sensitivity of the passwords and the security measures in place to protect
      system metadata.
    * Solution: Consider using more secure methods for handling passwords, such
      as hashing and salting, and storing them securely in a separate database
      table or using a dedicated secrets management service. Additionally,
      ensure that passwords are transmitted over secure channels and are never
      stored or transmitted in
