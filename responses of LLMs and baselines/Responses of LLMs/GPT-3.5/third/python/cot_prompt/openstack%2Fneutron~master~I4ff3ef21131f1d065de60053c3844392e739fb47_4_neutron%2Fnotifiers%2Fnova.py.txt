The original code does not appear to have any obvious security defects. It
follows standard practices for logging, exception handling, and API usage.
However, there are a few areas that could be improved for better security
practices:

 1. Sensitive Information Logging (Line 184): When logging that the port ID is
    not set, it's important to avoid logging the actual ID to prevent exposure
    of sensitive information. Ensure that the log message does not include the
    actual port ID.
    
    Solution: Modify the log message to remove the port ID, or log a generic
    message indicating the issue without specific details.

 2. Error Handling (Lines 267-272): In the send_events method, there's a generic
    exception catch block that logs the exception without further context. This
    could potentially expose internal information or cause unintended behavior
    if the exception is not properly handled.
    
    Solution: Catch specific exceptions that are expected and handle them
    appropriately. For unexpected exceptions, consider logging a generic error
    message without exposing internal details.

Other than these minor suggestions, the code appears to be well-structured and
does not contain any obvious security defects.
