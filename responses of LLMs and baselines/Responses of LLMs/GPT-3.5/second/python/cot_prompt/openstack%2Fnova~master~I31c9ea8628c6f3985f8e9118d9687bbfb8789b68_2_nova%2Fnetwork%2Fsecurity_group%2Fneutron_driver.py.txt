Here are some security defects found in the original code along with their
descriptions, corresponding line numbers, and solutions:

 1. Error Handling Disclosure (Line 56, Line 76, Line 148, Line 152, Line 154,
    Line 157, Line 187, Line 194, Line 298, Line 305, Line 313, Line 358, Line
    369, Line 383, Line 457, Line 512):
    
    * Description: The code logs sensitive error messages or exceptions, which
      can potentially disclose sensitive information about the system or its
      configuration in case of an error.
    * Line Numbers: Line 56, Line 76, Line 148, Line 152, Line 154, Line 157,
      Line 187, Line 194, Line 298, Line 305, Line 313, Line 358, Line 369, Line
      383, Line 457, Line 512.
    * Solution: Instead of logging detailed error messages or exceptions
      directly, log generic error messages and handle exceptions gracefully
      without revealing sensitive information.

 2. Password Leakage (Line 368):
    
    * Description: The code may inadvertently log security group IDs in error
      messages, which could include sensitive information if these IDs are
      treated as secrets or credentials.
    * Line Number: Line 368.
    * Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information such as security group IDs.
      Log generic error messages or use placeholders for sensitive data in log
      messages.

 3. Incomplete Exception Handling (Line 336, Line 483):
    
    * Description: The code catches exceptions but does not handle them
      appropriately or raise specific exceptions after catching them, which can
      lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    * Line Numbers: Line 336, Line 483.
    * Solution: Handle exceptions appropriately by either raising specific
      exceptions after catching them or implementing error handling logic based
      on the exception type to ensure proper program flow and security.

 4. Potential SQL Injection (Line 163, Line 164, Line 184):
    
    * Description: The code appears to construct queries using user-supplied
      input (names, ids, project, search_opts), which can lead to SQL injection
      vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated or sanitized.
    * Line Numbers: Line 163, Line 164, Line 184.
    * Solution: Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to safely construct
      queries and avoid direct concatenation o
