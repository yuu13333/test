Here are some security issues found in the generated code along with their
corresponding solutions:

 1. Potential Information Disclosure (Line 25):
    
    * Issue: The description for the policy rule BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'index'
      reveals that it shows "NUMA topology data of a given server." This could
      be considered sensitive information.
    * Solution: Modify the description to be more generic and avoid revealing
      specific details about the data being accessed. For example, the
      description could be changed to "Show detailed server information."

 2. Improper Exception Handling (Lines 34-41):
    
    * Issue: The exception handling in the index and host_info methods catches
      exception.InstanceNotFound and returns a 404 HTTP response. However, it's
      generally not recommended to expose detailed error messages directly to
      users as it can leak information about the system.
    * Solution: Handle the exceptions more gracefully by returning a generic
      error message without disclosing specific details about the error or the
      system. For example, return a 404 with a message like "Resource not found"
      without mentioning the specific resource type or ID.

 3. Missing Input Validation (Lines 31, 41):
    
    * Issue: The code does not perform input validation on the server_id
      parameter received in the index and host_info methods. Lack of input
      validation can lead to potential security vulnerabilities such as SQL
      injection or unauthorized access to resources.
    * Solution: Validate the server_id parameter to ensure it meets expected
      criteria (e.g., UUID format, existence in the system) before processing
      the request. Use libraries or frameworks for input validation or write
      custom validation logic.

 4. Lack of Logging (Lines 20, 28, 38):
    
    * Issue: The code lacks proper logging of important events or errors, which
      is essential for security monitoring and debugging.
    * Solution: Add logging statements at critical points in the code to log
      relevant information such as incoming requests, errors, and important
      actions taken by the application. Use appropriate log levels based on the
      severity of the information.

 5. Insecure Default Policy (Line 23):
    
    * Issue: The default policy base.RULE_ADMIN_OR_OWNER for the 'index' policy
      rule allows access to NUMA topology data for both administrators and
      owners of the resource. De
