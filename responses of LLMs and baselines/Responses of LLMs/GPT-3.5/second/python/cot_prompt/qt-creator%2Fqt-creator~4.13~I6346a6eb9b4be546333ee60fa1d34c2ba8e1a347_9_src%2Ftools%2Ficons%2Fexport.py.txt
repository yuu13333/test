The original code does not seem to have any glaring security defects. However,
there are some areas where security best practices could be improved:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability: In the exportPngs function, the subprocess
    is invoked with user-controlled input (inkscape). This could potentially
    lead to command injection if inkscape is manipulated by an attacker.
    
    python
    Copy code
    inkscapeProcess = subprocess.Popen([inkscape, '--shell'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, cwd=qtcRoot())
    
    
    Solution: To mitigate this, sanitize or validate the input provided to
    inkscape before executing the subprocess. If possible, avoid using
    shell=True and prefer providing the arguments as a list.

 2. Potential Path Traversal: The script constructs file paths using
    user-controlled input (svgFile) without proper validation. This could lead
    to path traversal vulnerabilities if an attacker manipulates the input to
    access files outside of the intended directory.
    
    python
    Copy code
    svgTree.parse(qtcRoot() + svgFile)
    
    
    Solution: Ensure that the svgFile input is properly validated to prevent
    directory traversal attacks. This can be achieved by restricting the file
    path to a specific directory or using a whitelist approach.

 3. Input Validation: The script uses user input (args.filter) directly in
    regular expression matching without proper validation. This could lead to
    unexpected behavior or potentially a denial of service if the input is
    maliciously crafted.

    Copy code
