Based on the provided code snippet, no explicit security defects are apparent.
However, here are some general security practices and potential areas for
improvement:

 1. SQL Injection Prevention (Line 462):
    
    * Security Defect: Directly interpolating variables into the SQL query
      without using parameterized queries could lead to SQL injection
      vulnerabilities.
    * Line Number: Line 462 (ports = port_qry.filter(...)).
    * Solution: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods to safely handle user
      inputs in SQL queries. For example, SQLAlchemy provides methods like
      .filter_by() that automatically handle parameterization.

 2. Exception Handling (Lines 106, 129, 210, 290, 394):
    
    * Security Concern: Generic exception handling without specific exception
      types could hide potential security issues or system failures.
    * Line Numbers: Lines 106, 129, 210, 290, 394.
    * Solution: Handle specific exceptions and provide appropriate error
      messages or fallback mechanisms. This improves the system's resilience and
      helps in diagnosing problems.

 3. Logging of Sensitive Data (Lines 244, 479):
    
    * Security Concern: Logging sensitive information such as IP addresses (ip,
      ip_address) and MAC addresses (mac) could pose a security risk if the logs
      are not adequately secured.
    * Line Numbers: Lines 244, 479.
    * Solution: Avoid logging sensitive data directly. If logging is necessary,
      ensure that logs are stored securely, access-controlled, and sanitized to
      remove sensitive information.

 4. Error Handling and Rollback (Lines 106, 129, 394):
    
    * Security Defect: In some cases, error handling and rollback mechanisms
      might not be sufficient or may not cover all possible failure scenarios,
      leading to inconsistent data states or resource leaks
