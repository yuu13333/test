Upon reviewing the original code provided, I didn't find any immediate security
defects. The code seems well-structured and focuses on functionality related to
throttling SIGHUP signals for Keepalived. It includes imports from trusted
libraries, uses context managers appropriately, and implements functionality
related to signal handling without obvious security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, I can confirm that no security defects are detected in the code.
