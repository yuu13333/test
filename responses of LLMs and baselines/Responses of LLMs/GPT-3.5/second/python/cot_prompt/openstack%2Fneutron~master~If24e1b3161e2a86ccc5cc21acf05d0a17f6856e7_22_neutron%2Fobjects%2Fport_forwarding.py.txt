Upon reviewing the original code, I have identified a potential security
concern:

Security Defect: Potential SQL Injection

 * Line Number: 118
 * Description: The method get_port_forwarding_obj_by_routers constructs a
   database query using string formatting to include router_ids. If router_ids
   comes from user input and is not properly sanitized, it could lead to SQL
   injection vulnerabilities.
 * Solution: To mitigate SQL injection, you should use parameterized queries or
   ORM methods that automatically escape input values. In SQLAlchemy, you can
   use parameter binding or ORM methods like filter_by to safely construct
   queries. For example, instead of string formatting, you can use SQLAlchemy's
   in_ method like this:
   python
   Copy code
   query = query.filter(l3.FloatingIP.router_id.in_(router_ids))
   

No security defects are detected in the rest of the code.
