Upon reviewing the original code for security defects, I found one potential
security issue:

Potential Security Issue: Lack of SSL/TLS for Secure Communication

 * Line Number(s): There is no specific line dedicated to SSL/TLS
   implementation, but it's notably absent throughout the code.

Description: The code deals with proxying RFB (Remote Framebuffer) connections
between a client and a server, specifically focusing on the security negotiation
phase. However, the code does not include SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets
Layer/Transport Layer Security) for securing the communication channel between
the client and server. Without SSL/TLS, the data exchanged between the client,
server, and proxy can be susceptible to interception or modification by
malicious actors, leading to potential security breaches or data leaks.

Solution: To address this security issue, SSL/TLS should be implemented to
encrypt the communication between the client, proxy, and server. This encryption
ensures that sensitive data, including authentication credentials and session
details, remains confidential and secure during transmission. The implementation
would involve using libraries or frameworks that provide SSL/TLS functionality,
configuring certificates for secure connections, and ensuring proper handling of
encrypted data within the proxy code.
