Here are some security concerns found in the original code along with their
corresponding line numbers and solutions:

 1. Security Concern: Insecure Named Pipe Creation
    
    * Line Number: 96-137
    * Description: The NamedPipe class creates named pipes with default security
      attributes (sec_attributes=-1), which means the named pipe handle is
      inherited when a new process is created. This can lead to security risks
      if malicious processes gain access to these inherited handles.
    * Solution: Use more restrictive security attributes (SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES)
      that do not allow inheritance unless explicitly required.

 2. Security Concern: Insecure Named Pipe File Creation
    
    * Line Number: 166-191
    * Description: The create_file method for named pipes uses default security
      attributes (sec_attributes=-1) for file creation, allowing the file handle
      to be inherited by child processes. This can be exploited by malicious
      processes.
    * Solution: Use more secure SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES with proper access control
      to restrict handle inheritance.

 3. Security Concern: Lack of Input Validation in blocking_write
    
    * Line Number: 193-225
    * Description: The blocking_write method does not perform input validation
      on the buf parameter, which could potentially lead to buffer overflow
      vulnerabilities if untrusted input is passed.
    * Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the buffer size does
      not exceed the expected limits.

 4. Security Concern: Insecure File Handle Closure
    
    * Line Number: 346-361
    * Description: The close_all_handles method does not securely close file
      handles, potentially leaving them open for unauthorized access or resource
      leaks.
    * Solution: Implement secure handle closure mechanisms, such as zeroing out
      handles after closing them and using appropriate error handling.

 5. Security Concern: Lack of Exception Handling in __del__
    
    * Line Number: 363-365
    * Description: The __del__ method attempts to close handles without proper
      exception handling, which can lead to resource leaks or unexpected
      behavior if an exception occurs during handle closure.
    * Solution: Add try-except blocks with appropriate error handling for handle
      closure operations.

Overall, these issues
