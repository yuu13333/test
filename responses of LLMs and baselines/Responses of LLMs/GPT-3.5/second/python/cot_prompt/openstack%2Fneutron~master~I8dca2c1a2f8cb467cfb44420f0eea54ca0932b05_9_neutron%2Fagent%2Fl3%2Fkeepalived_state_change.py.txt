The original code seems generally well-structured, but there are a couple of
potential security concerns:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability:
    
    * Location: Lines 138-147
    * Description: The send_garp() method constructs a command string using
      input from the event dictionary (event['name']). If an attacker controls
      the value of event['name'], they could potentially inject malicious
      commands, leading to command injection vulnerability.
    * Solution: Use proper input sanitization and validation techniques, such as
      whitelisting allowed characters or using parameterized commands to prevent
      command injection attacks. For example, use libraries like shlex.quote()
      to properly escape command arguments.

 2. Missing Input Validation:
    
    * Location: Lines 105-109
    * Description: In the handle_initial_state() method, the code retrieves
      information about router interfaces and directly uses the CIDR value from
      the address without proper validation. If the CIDR value is not validated
      properly, it could lead to unexpected behavior or exploitation.
    * Solution: Validate the CIDR value retrieved from address.get('cidr') to
      ensure it adheres to the expected format. Additionally, ensure that the
      input is coming from a trusted source and perform input validation to
      prevent unexpected behavior.

 3. Unsafe Use of subprocess (Not in the original code, but can be introduced in
    modifications):
    
    * Location: Anywhere subprocess module is used.
    * Description: If subprocess commands are not properly sanitized or
      validated, it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities similar to the
      one described in point 1.
    * Solution: Always sanitize and validate user input before using it in
      subprocess commands. Prefer using high-level APIs or libraries that
      abstract away the need for subprocess calls whenever possible.

To address these concerns, ensure that user input is prope
