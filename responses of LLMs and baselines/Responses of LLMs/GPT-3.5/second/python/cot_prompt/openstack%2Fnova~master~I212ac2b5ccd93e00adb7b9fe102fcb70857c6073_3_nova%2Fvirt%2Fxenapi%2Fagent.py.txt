Upon reviewing the original code for security defects, I identified a potential
security concern related to the handling of OpenSSL encryption and decryption in
the SimpleDH class. Here's the analysis along with the corresponding line number
and a proposed solution:

SECURITY DEFECT:

 1. Vulnerable Encryption Handling (Line 412, Line 438-441): In the SimpleDH
    class, the encryption and decryption methods use the openssl command
    directly via processutils.execute. This approach can be risky because it
    relies on external shell commands and may expose the application to shell
    injection attacks if not properly sanitized.

LINE NUMBERS:

 * Line 412: def get_public(self):
 * Line 438-441: def encrypt(self, text):, def decrypt(self, text):

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

 1. Use Python Cryptography Libraries: Instead of relying on the external
    openssl command, it's safer to use Python cryptography libraries such as
    cryptography or pycryptodome for encryption and decryption operations. These
    libraries provide safer and more controlled ways to handle cryptographic
    operations without relying on shell commands.

Here is an example of how the encrypt and decrypt methods can be modified using
the cryptography library:

python
Copy code
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
import base64

class SimpleDH(object):
    # Existing code...

    def __init__(self):
        # Existing code...

    def encrypt(self, text):
        key = self._derive_key()
        iv = self._generate_iv()
        cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CFB(iv), backend=default_backend())
        encryptor = cipher.encryptor()
        encrypted_data = encryptor.update(text.encode()) + encryptor.finalize()
        return base64.b64encode(iv + encrypted_data).decode()

    def decrypt(self, text):
        key = self._derive_key()
        data = base64.b64decode(text.encode())
        iv = data[:16]
        ciphertext = data[16:]
        cipher = Cipher(algorithm
