The original code seems generally well-written, but there are a couple of
security concerns that should be addressed:

 1. Potential Information Leakage in Logs: In the NovaProxyRequestHandlerBase
    class, there's a log message that includes sensitive information (the
    connect info), which might inadvertently leak secrets or sensitive data if
    the logs are not properly secured.
    
    * Line Number: Line 141
    * Security Concern: This line logs the connect information, which may
      contain sensitive data such as authentication tokens.
    * Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is not logged at an INFO level
      or above, or mask sensitive information before logging. For instance,
      masking the token using a function like utils.mask_token() before logging
      it.

 2. Potential Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH): The WebSocket proxy
    doesn't validate the origin properly, which could lead to Cross-Site
    WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks. The code checks the Host header, but it
    should also validate the Origin header to ensure that WebSocket connections
    are only accepted from trusted origins.
    
    * Line Number: Lines 115-138
    * Security Concern: Lack of proper origin validation could allow an attacker
      to establish WebSocket connections from unauthorized origins, leading to
      attacks like Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH).
    * Solution: Implement strict origin validation by checking the Origin header
      against a whitelist of trusted origins. Ensure that the WebSocket
      connection is only established if the origin matches one of the
      whitelisted origins.

 3. Improper Error Handling: In the new_websocket_client method, if an exception
    occurs during WebSocket connection establishment (do_proxy method), the code
    attempts to close the socket but doesn't handle the exception properly,
    potentially leaving the connection in an inconsistent state.
    
    * Line Number: Lines 165-172
    * Security Concern: Improper error handling could lead to resource leaks or
      unexpected behavior, potentially opening the system to denial of service
      attacks or other vulnerabilities.
    * Solution: Implement proper error handling using try-except-finally blocks
      to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up, and potential errors are
      handled gracefully.

By addressing these issues, the code can be made more secure and resilient
against potential security threats.
