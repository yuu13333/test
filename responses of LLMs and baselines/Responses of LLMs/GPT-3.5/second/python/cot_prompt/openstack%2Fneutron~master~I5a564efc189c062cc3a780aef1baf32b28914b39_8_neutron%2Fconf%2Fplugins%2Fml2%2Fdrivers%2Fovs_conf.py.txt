The original code appears to be well-structured and doesn't contain any glaring
security defects. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for
security:

 1. Input Validation for IP Addresses: The code accepts IP addresses as
    configuration options (local_ip, of_listen_address). While these options are
    meant to be configured by administrators, it's good practice to validate
    user inputs to prevent injection attacks or accidental misconfigurations.
    
    Line Number: 44, 84
    
    Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the provided IP
    addresses are valid and don't contain any malicious payloads. This can be
    achieved by using appropriate libraries or regular expressions to validate
    the format of the IP address.

 2. Deprecated Options: There are some options marked as deprecated
    (of_interface, agent_type, prevent_arp_spoofing). Deprecated options might
    indicate that there are better alternatives available, and continued usage
    might lead to compatibility issues or reliance on insecure features.
    
    Line Number: 74, 160, 129
    
    Solution: Review the deprecated options and migrate to the recommended
    alternatives. Ensure that the migration process is documented and
    communicated to users/administrators.

 3. Sensitive Information in Configuration: Configuration files may contain
    sensitive information such as IP addresses, port numbers, or directory paths
    (of_listen_address, of_listen_port, vhostuser_socket_dir). Leakage of such
    information could potentially aid attackers in c
