Here are some potential security concerns in the original code along with their
corresponding line numbers and suggested solutions:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability (Line 168, 176, 198, 206, 218):
    
    * Issue: The code uses subprocess to execute Docker commands without proper
      input validation. This could lead to command injection attacks if
      user-controlled data is passed to these commands.
    * Solution: Use subprocess.run or subprocess.Popen with proper arguments,
      especially when user input is involved. Sanitize input or use
      parameterized commands to prevent command injection.

 2. Hardcoded Credentials (Line 145):
    
    * Issue: The DockerConfig class hardcodes the domain name DOMAIN_NAME
      without proper handling or obfuscation. Hardcoding sensitive information
      like domain names can expose the system to attackers.
    * Solution: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information. Use environment
      variables or secure configuration files to store and retrieve sensitive
      data.

 3. Information Disclosure (Line 95, 121, 138, 143):
    
    * Issue: The code reveals potentially sensitive information such as server
      names, image names, and hostnames in error messages or logs, which could
      aid attackers in reconnaissance or targeted attacks.
    * Solution: Avoid logging or exposing sensitive information in error
      messages or logs. Use generic error messages and log only necessary
      information for debugging purposes.

 4. Use of Obsolete Python Version (Line 1):
    
    * Issue: The code starts with #!/usr/bin/env python2, indicating
      compatibility with Python 2 which is obsolete and no longer supported.
    * Solution: Update the code to use Python 3, which is actively maintained
      and more secure.

 5. Environment Variable Handling (Line 99, 103):
    
    * Issue: The code checks for the existence of environment variables using
      os.environ.has_key, which is not the recommended way to check for
      environment variables in Python.
    * Solution: Use os.environ.get to check for environment variables in a safer
      and more Pythonic way.

 6. Lack of Input Sanitization (Line 113):
    
    * Issue: The code directly uses user-supplied data (copy_file.src) in
      constructing shell commands without proper sanitization or validation,
      which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
    * Solution: Validate and sanitize user inputs before using them
