The original code provided seems to be relatively well-structured and does not
exhibit any obvious security defects. However, security is a nuanced aspect, and
it's crucial to consider various factors, including data validation, encryption
protocols, authentication mechanisms, and error handling.

Upon reviewing the code, here are some considerations:

 1. TLS Version: The use of TLSv1.2 for secure VNC access is a step towards
    modernizing the encryption protocol, enhancing security, and addressing
    potential vulnerabilities associated with older TLS versions. This change
    was correctly addressed in the updated code.

 2. SSL Certificate Validation: The code verifies the server's certificate by
    setting cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_REQUIRED in ssl.wrap_socket(). This ensures that
    the client verifies the server's identity during the SSL/TLS handshake.
    However, proper validation of the server's certificate chain and hostname
    verification should also be performed to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    This includes verifying the server's certificate against a trusted
    Certificate Authority (CA) using the ca_certs parameter.

 3. Error Handling: The code includes error handling for SSL-related exceptions
    (ssl.SSLError) during the TLS handshake. It's important to provide
    informative error messages without revealing sensitive information that
    could aid potential attackers. The error messages should be logged
    appropriately and avoid leaking details that could assist an attacker in
    exploiting vulnerabilities.

 4. Configuration Security: The usage of sensitive information such as private
    keys (client_key) and certificates (client_cert) from configuration
    parameters
