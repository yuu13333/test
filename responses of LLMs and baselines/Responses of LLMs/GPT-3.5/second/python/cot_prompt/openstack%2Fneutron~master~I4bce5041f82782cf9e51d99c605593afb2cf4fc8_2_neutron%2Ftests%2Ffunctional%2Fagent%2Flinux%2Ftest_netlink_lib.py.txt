The original code provided appears to be focused on functional testing and
doesn't inherently contain obvious security vulnerabilities. However, there are
a few areas that could be improved to enhance security and robustness:

 1. Command Injection Risk (Line 51): In the _create_entries method, the
    linux_utils.execute function is called with a command that is constructed
    using user-supplied data (e.g., the zone parameter). If the zone parameter
    is not properly sanitized, it could lead to command injection
    vulnerabilities.
    
    * Security Risk: Command injection vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to
      execute arbitrary commands on the system.
    * Solution: Ensure proper validation and sanitization of input parameters,
      such as the zone parameter. Preferably, use parameterized commands or
      validate input against an allowlist of acceptable values.

 2. Error Handling and Exception Propagation (Lines 55, 77): In both exception
    handling blocks, a generic Exception is raised without any specific context.
    This can make it difficult to identify the cause of errors, hindering
    troubleshooting and potentially hiding security-related issues.
    
    * Security Risk: Poor error handling practices can lead to inadequate
      logging and obscure security incidents.
    * Solution: Provide more specific error messages that convey meaningful
      information about the nature of the error. Additionally, consider logging
