Upon reviewing the generated files and considering the context of the original
code, no security defects are detected in the code. The generated files focus on
basic class definitions and test cases, which do not exhibit any apparent
security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, authentication flaws, or
data exposure. Therefore, the code appears to be secure in this simplified
context.

If you have specific security concerns or if there are additional
functionalities or interactions not covered in the provided code, a more
comprehensive analysis may be required to identify potential security defects.
