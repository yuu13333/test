Upon analyzing the original code provided, here are potential security defects
and their corresponding solutions:

 1. Potential Command Injection in KeepalivedTrackScript._add_ip_addr (line
    494): The _add_ip_addr method constructs a command string using
    user-controlled input (ip_addr) without proper sanitization. This can lead
    to command injection vulnerabilities.
    
    Solution: Sanitize the ip_addr input to ensure it only contains valid IP
    addresses or perform input validation to prevent malicious input. Use proper
    escaping techniques when constructing command strings to avoid command
    injection vulnerabilities.

 2. Potential File Path Injection in KeepalivedManager.get_full_config_file_path
    (line 371): The get_full_config_file_path method constructs a file path
    using user-controlled input (filename) without proper validation. If an
    attacker can control the filename, they might manipulate the file path
    leading to path traversal or arbitrary file creation vulnerabilities.
    
    Solution: Validate the filename input to ensure it only contains allowed
    characters and does not allow directory traversal (../). Additionally,
    consider using absolute paths or predefined directories to avoid path
    traversal issues.

 3. Sensitive Data Exposure in KeepalivedConf.get_config_str (line 347): The
    get_config_str method generates the Keepalived configuration string, which
    may include sensitive information such as IP addresses, passwords, or
    configuration details. Exposing this information in logs or debug outputs
    can lead to security breaches.
    
    Solution: Avoid logging or exposing sensitive information in configuration
    strings or debug outputs. Ensure that sensitive data is handled securely and
    access is restricted to authorized users or systems.

 4. Potential Privilege Escalation in KeepalivedManager.spawn (line 394): The
    spawn method appears to execute commands related to Keepalived configuration
    and process management. If this functionality is executed with elevated
    privileges or without proper validation, it could lead to privilege
    escalation vulnerabilities.
    
    Solution: Ensure that commands executed in the spawn method are validated,
    sanitized, and executed with the least privilege necessa
