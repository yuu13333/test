Here's a review of the code for security defects:

 1.  CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
     
     * No instances of improper access control are detected in the code.

 2.  CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
     
     * No instances of improper interaction between multiple entities are
       detected in the code.

 3.  CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
     
     * No instances of improper control of a resource through its lifetime are
       detected in the code.

 4.  CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
     
     * No instances of incorrect calculation are detected in the code.

 5.  CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
     
     * No instances of insufficient control flow management are detected in the
       code.

 6.  CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
     
     * No instances of protection mechanism failure are detected in the code.

 7.  CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
     
     * No instances of incorrect comparison are detected in the code.

 8.  CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
     
     * Exception handling is present, but there are areas for improvement:
       * In the handle_password function, there's a check for req.method, but no
         default case for unsupported methods. It's recommended to explicitly
         handle unsupported methods and return an appropriate HTTP response
         (e.g., 405 Method Not Allowed).
       * In the handle_password function, when catching
         exception.InstanceNotFound, the exception message is directly exposed
         to the user, which might reveal sensitive information. It's advisable
         to provide a more generic error message to users to avoid leaking
         information.

 9.  CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
     
     * No instances of improper neutralization are detected in the code.

 10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
     
     * There are no significant issues with adherence to coding standards
       observed in the code.

Solution:

 * Enhance exception handling by explicitly handling unsupported methods in the
   handle_password function and providing generic error messages to users to
   avoid leaking sensitive information.
 * Consider reviewing the broader context of the application to ensure that all
   inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

Overall Assessment: No significant security defects are detected in the code,
but there are areas for improvement in exception handling to enhance resilience
and prevent information leakage.
