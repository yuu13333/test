The code you provided seems generally well-structured and follows good
practices. However, I've identified a potential security issue:


SECURITY DEFECT DETECTED:

ISSUE: UNPROTECTED OBJECT ATTRIBUTE

 * Line Number: 85
 * Description: In the _load_attr_from_fip method, the attribute attrname is
   directly used to access the attribute of the fip_obj object without proper
   validation.
 * Potential Risk: This can lead to an AttributeError if attrname contains an
   invalid attribute name or if the attribute being accessed is not intended to
   be exposed externally.
 * Solution: Before accessing the attribute attrname of the fip_obj object,
   ensure that it's a valid and expected attribute. You can use hasattr() to
   check if the attribute exists before accessing it.

pythonCopy code
def _load_attr_from_fip(self, attrname):
    # get all necessary info from fip obj
    fip_obj = self._get_fip_obj()
    if hasattr(fip_obj, attrname):  # Check if attribute exists
        value = getattr(fip_obj, attrname)
        setattr(self, attrname, value)
        self.obj_reset_changes([attrname])
    else:
        # Handle the case where the attribute does not exist or is not intended to be accessed externally
        pass  # You may raise an error or log a warning depending on the context



NO SECURITY DEFECTS ARE DETECTED IN THE REST OF THE CODE.
