# Security Defect Detection Report:

# 1. Unsanitized Input Leading to SQL Injection:
   - Line Number: 84
   - Description: The `RequestContext` class allows `read_deleted` to be passed from user input (`kwargs`) directly into the constructor without proper validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if `read_deleted` is manipulated by an attacker.
   - Solution: Validate and sanitize the `read_deleted` parameter before using it in the SQL queries. Ensure that it only contains expected values ('no', 'yes', 'only').

# 2. Unhandled Exception Leakage:
   - Line Number: 452
   - Description: In the `scatter_gather_cells` function, exceptions raised during the execution of `fn` are caught and logged, but the original exception object is returned to the caller. This could potentially expose sensitive information or aid attackers in exploiting the system.
   - Solution: Instead of returning the original exception object, return a generic error message or code indicating a failure occurred, while logging the detailed exception information securely for debugging purposes.

# 3. Lack of Input Validation in `authorize_project_context` and `authorize_user_context`:
   - Line Numbers: 321, 328
   - Description: These functions do not perform adequate input validation on `project_id` and `user_id` parameters, respectively. Lack of validation may allow malicious users to manipulate these parameters and gain unauthorized access to resources.
   - Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that `project_id` and `user_id` are properly formatted and authorized within the system.

# 4. Potential Information Disclosure:
   - Line Numbers: 274-283
   - Description: The `get_context` and `get_admin_context` functions return RequestContext objects with sensitive information (e.g., user_id, project_id) set to None. While this might be intended behavior, it could potentially lead to information disclosure if these contexts are used inadvertently without proper initialization.
   - Solution: Clearly document the intended use of these functions and ensure that uninitialized RequestContext objects are not used in contexts where sensitive information could be exposed.

# 5. Lack of Error Handling in `scatter_gather_all_cells`:
   - Line Number: 556
   - Description: The `scatter_gather_all_cells` function does not handle potential errors that may occur during the scatter-gather operation. This could result in unexpected behavior or failure to handle exceptions, leading to system instability or security vulnerabilities.
   - Solution: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and failures during the scatter-gather process.
