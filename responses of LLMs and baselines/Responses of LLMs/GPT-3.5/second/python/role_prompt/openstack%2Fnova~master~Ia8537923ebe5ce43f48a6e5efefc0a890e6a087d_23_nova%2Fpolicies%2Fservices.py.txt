The code you provided seems well-structured and follows best practices. However,
I noticed a potential security concern:


SECURITY DEFECT:

In the deprecated_reason string (line 27), the explanation mentions specific
version information about when the old policies will be deprecated and ignored.
This information could provide attackers with insights into the system's version
and potentially aid them in crafting attacks targeted at specific
vulnerabilities present in earlier versions.


LINE NUMBER:

 * Line 27


SOLUTION:

Avoid providing detailed version information in deprecation messages or any
other public-facing strings. Instead, generalize the message to convey the
deprecation without exposing version details. For example:

python
Copy code
DEPRECATED_REASON = """
Since the Ussuri release, nova API policies are introducing new default roles
with scope_type capabilities. These changes improve the security level
and manageability. New policies are more robust in terms of handling access
at system and project level token with read, write roles.
Start using the new policies and enable the scope checks via config option
``nova.conf [oslo_policy] enforce_scope=True`` which is False by default.
Old policies are marked as deprecated and will be ignored in future releases.
"""


This change ensures that potential attackers do not gain information about the
specific version and release timeline of the system, making it harder for them
to exploit known vulnerabilities.

With this modification, the code would have no security defects.
