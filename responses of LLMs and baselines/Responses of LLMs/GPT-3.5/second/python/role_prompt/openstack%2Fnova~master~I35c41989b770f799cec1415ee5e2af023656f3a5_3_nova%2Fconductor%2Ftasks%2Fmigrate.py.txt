The code you provided seems well-structured and commented, which is great for
understanding its functionality. However, I did find a security-related issue in
the code:


SECURITY DEFECT DETECTED:

INSECURE LOGGING OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION

 * Line Number: 48, 75, 107
 * Description: The code logs sensitive information such as host and node names
   directly without obfuscation or sanitization. This can potentially expose
   critical system details to attackers if the logs are not properly secured.
 * Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information directly. Instead, log only
   essential information or use placeholders in log messages and pass sensitive
   data separately through secure channels or store them securely.

Example of a vulnerable line:

python
Copy code
LOG.error('Unable to find record for source ' 'node %(node)s on %(host)s',
           {'host': instance.host, 'node': instance.node}, instance=instance)


Should be modified to:

python
Copy code
LOG.error('Unable to find record for source node %s on host %s',
           instance.node, instance.host, instance=instance)



NO SECURITY DEFECTS ARE DETECTED IN THE REST OF THE CODE.

Feel free to incorporate these suggestions to enhance the security of the code.
Let me know if you need further assistance!
