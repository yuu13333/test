The code you provided seems to be a Python script for managing Docker
configurations and operations. After reviewing the code, I found several
security issues:

 1. Insecure Environment Variable Access:
    
    * Line 99 and 102: The code uses
      os.environ.has_key("TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL"), which checks for the
      existence of an environment variable. This method is deprecated in Python
      2 and has been removed in Python 3, leaving it susceptible to future
      issues. Instead, use if "TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL" in os.environ: for Python
      2 or if "TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL" in os.environ.keys(): for both Python 2
      and 3.

 2. Command Injection Vulnerability:
    
    * Line 102, 104, 173, 175, 197: The code constructs shell commands using
      string formatting with variables containing user-controlled data
      (dummy_port, dummy_id, dummy_alias, config.host_name, etc.). This can lead
      to command injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly
      sanitized. To mitigate this, use the subprocess module's check_call or
      Popen with a list of arguments instead of using shell=True, and ensure
      that user-controlled input is properly escaped.

 3. Potential Information Disclosure:
    
    * Line 79, 143, 138: The DockerConfig class contains methods (docker_file,
      get_image_name, get_server_name, get_host_name) that construct strings
      using potentially sensitive information like server names and versions.
      Depending on how this class is used, this could lead to information
      disclosure. Ensure that sensitive information is not exposed in logs or
      error messages.

 4. Error Handling:
    
    * Line 161, 182, 208, 220, 227: The code exits with -1 upon encountering
      errors. This might be acceptable for a script, but it's generally better
      to raise exceptions or return error codes so that the caller can handle
      the error gracefully.

These issues should be addressed to improve the security of the script. Here's a
summary of the solutions:

 1. Replace os.environ.has_key("TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL") with if
    "TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL" in os.environ.
 2. Sanitize user-controlled input before constructing shell commands to prevent
    command injection vulnerabilities.
 3. Ensure that sensitive information is handled securely and not exposed in
    logs or error messages.
 4. Consider using exceptions or returning error codes instead of exiting the
    script with -1.
