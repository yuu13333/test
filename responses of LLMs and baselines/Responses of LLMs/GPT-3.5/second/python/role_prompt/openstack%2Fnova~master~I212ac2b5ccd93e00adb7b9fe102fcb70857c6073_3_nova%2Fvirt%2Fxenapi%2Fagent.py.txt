# Security Defects Detected:
1. Hardcoded Secret in Code

# Security Defect Description:
A hardcoded secret is present in the code, which can pose a security risk if exposed or compromised. In the `_run_ssl` method of the `SimpleDH` class, the `pass:%s` string is used as the passphrase for encryption and decryption. Hardcoding secrets in the code is dangerous as it makes them vulnerable to exposure, especially if the code is shared or accessible to unauthorized users.

# Line Number(s) of Code:
Line 422: cmd = ['openssl', 'aes-128-cbc', '-A', '-a', '-pass', 'pass:%s' % self._shared, '-nosalt']

# Solution:
To mitigate this security risk, consider using a secure and reliable method for storing secrets, such as environment variables, configuration files outside of version control, or a secrets management system. Avoid hardcoding secrets directly into the code.
