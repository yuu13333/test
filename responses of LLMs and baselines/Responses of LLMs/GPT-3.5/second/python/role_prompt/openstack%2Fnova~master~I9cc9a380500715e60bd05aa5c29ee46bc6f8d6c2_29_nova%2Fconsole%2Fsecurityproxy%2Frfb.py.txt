The code appears to be well-structured and documented. However, there are a few
security concerns that need attention:

 1. Potential Information Leakage via Logging (Line 100):
    
    * Issue: The server version string is logged without redaction or
      sanitization.
    * Impact: This could potentially expose sensitive information about the
      server.
    * Recommendation: Ensure that sensitive information such as version strings
      are not logged, especially in debug mode. If logging is necessary for
      debugging purposes, consider redacting or sanitizing sensitive data.

 2. Potential Information Leakage via Error Messages (Line 154):
    
    * Issue: The error message includes potentially sensitive information such
      as the authentication type requested by the client.
    * Impact: This could leak information about the authentication mechanisms
      supported by the server.
    * Recommendation: Avoid including sensitive details in error messages sent
      to clients. Provide generic error messages that do not disclose specific
      information about server configurations or capabilities.

 3. Potential Information Leakage via Exception Handling (Lines 160-166,
    175-182):
    
    * Issue: Detailed exception messages are not redacted before being sent to
      clients.
    * Impact: This could provide attackers with insights into potential
      vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    * Recommendation: Ensure that exception messages do not contain sensitive
      information. Provide generic error messages to clients and log detailed
      error information internally for debugging purposes.

 4. Insecure Protocol Version Comparison (Lines 101, 113):
    
    * Issue: The code compares protocol versions using a floating-point
      comparison, which may not be precise.
    * Impact: Floating-point comparisons may lead to unexpected behavior and
      vulnerabilities.
    * Recommendation: Use integer comparisons or version parsing libraries to
      compare protocol versions accurately.

 5. Potential Denial of Service (DoS) via Unbounded Memory Allocation (Line 90):
    
    * Issue: The code reads from a socket without limiting the maximum number of
      bytes to read.
    * Impact: An attacker could potentially flood the server with large amounts
      of data, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service.
    * Recommendation: Implement proper bounds checking and limits on the amount
      of data read from sockets to prevent DoS attacks.

 6. Missing Input Validation (Lines 99, 109, 119, 124, 144):
    
    * Issue: Input received from external sources (e.g., network sockets) is not
      validated before use.
    * Impact: This could lead to various security vulnerabilities such as buffer
      overflows, injection attacks, or protocol manipulation.
    * Recommendation: Implement input validation checks to ensure that data
      received from external sources adheres to expected formats and ranges.
      Validate input size, content, and format before processing.

 7. Lack of Error Handling for Socket Operations (Lines 97, 109, 118, 143):
    
    * Issue: Socket operations are not properly checked for errors and
      exceptions.
    * Impact: Unhandled socket errors may lead to unpredictable behavior or
      vulnerabilities.
    * Recommendation: Implement robust error handling for socket operations,
      including catching and appropriately handling exceptions, closing sockets
      on errors, and logging error messages for debugging purposes.

 8. Insecure Cryptographic Practices (Lines 56, 69, 143):
    
    * Issue: The code uses basic encoding functions without considering
      cryptographic security best practices.
    * Impact: Insecure encoding may lead to vulnerabilities such as plaintext
      exposure or cryptographic weaknesses.
    * Recommendation: Use well-established cryptographic libraries and
      algorithms for encoding, hashing, and encryption. Follow security best
      practices for cryptographic operations to ensure confidentiality,
      integrity, and authenticity.

These are the security concerns identified in the code. Ensure that these issues
are addressed to enhance the security posture of the system.
