The code provided appears to have a security defect related to improper cleanup
of resource provider allocations when a resize operation fails. Let's break down
the issue:


ISSUE:

The defect is a potential Inadequate Resource Cleanup (CWE-404) problem.
Specifically, it involves the failure to properly revert resource allocations
when a resize operation fails.


CODE LINE:

The issue is present in lines 69-79.


DESCRIPTION:

 1. In the test_finish_resize_fails_allocation_cleanup method, after the resize
    operation fails, there's an attempt to check resource provider allocations.
 2. The code expects the allocations to be reverted when the resize operation
    fails, but due to a bug (commented as FIXME), the allocations are not
    properly reverted.
 3. As a result, even though the resize operation fails, the allocations on the
    destination node are not properly cleaned up, leading to potential resource
    wastage and inconsistency in resource allocation state.


SOLUTION:

To address this issue, you need to ensure that resource allocations are properly
reverted when a resize operation fails. This would involve fixing the bug
mentioned (FIXME comment) so that allocations are properly cleaned up on
failure.

You might want to revisit the code logic related to the cleanup process during
resize operations and ensure that all allocations are properly handled,
especially in failure scenarios.


REMEDIATION:

 1. Identify the root cause of why allocations are not reverted when the resize
    operation fails.
 2. Implement a fix to ensure that allocations are properly cleaned up in
    failure scenarios.
 3. Thoroughly test the fix to ensure that resource allocations behave as
    expected during both successful and failed resize operations.


CONCLUSION:

No security defects are detected in the code.
