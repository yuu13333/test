SECURITY DEFECTS:

 1. Information Disclosure (Line 151-157):
    
    * If a user doesn't have authorization for a resource, the system returns a
      404 error. However, if the user does have access, the system returns a 403
      error to prevent giving away information. This inconsistent behavior might
      inadvertently reveal the existence of resources to unauthorized users.
    * Solution: Ensure that the error messages are consistent regardless of the
      user's access rights to prevent potential information disclosure. Always
      return a 403 Forbidden error for unauthorized access to maintain
      consistency and avoid revealing resource existence.

 2. Insecure Direct Object References (Line 131-136):
    
    * In the fetch_resource function, the code fetches a resource based on the
      given resource_id without proper authorization checks. This can lead to
      Insecure Direct Object References if the authorization is not enforced
      consistently elsewhere in the application.
    * Solution: Ensure that authorization checks are performed before retrieving
      or accessing any sensitive resources. Implement proper access control
      mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to resources.

 3. Incomplete Authorization Checks (Line 144-157):
    
    * In the PolicyHook class, authorization checks are performed before
      executing actions on resources. However, there is inconsistency in error
      handling for unauthorized access. While a 404 error is raised for
      unauthorized access, a 403 error is raised if the user has access but is
      not the owner of the resource. This inconsistency might reveal the
      existence of resources to unauthorized users.
    * Solution: Ensure consistent error handling for unauthorized access to
      resources. Always return a 403 Forbidden error for unauthorized access to
      maintain consistency and avoid revealing resource existence.


OVERALL ASSESSMENT:

The code contains several security defects related to inconsistent error
handling and incomplete authorization checks. These issues could potentially
lead to information disclosure and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
It's essential to address these vulnerabilities to ensure the security of the
application.
