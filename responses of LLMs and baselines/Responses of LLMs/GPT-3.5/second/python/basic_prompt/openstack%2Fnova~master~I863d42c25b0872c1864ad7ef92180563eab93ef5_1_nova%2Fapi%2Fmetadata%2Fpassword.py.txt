The code seems generally secure, but there are a couple of potential
improvements and one potential security issue:

 1. Line 27: CHUNKS = 428 and CHUNK_LENGTH = 255 are arbitrary values. Depending
    on the system requirements, these values could be too large or too small.
    There should be some rationale behind choosing these values, and they should
    be documented. Additionally, using magic numbers without explanation can
    make the code less maintainable. Consider adding comments explaining why
    these specific values were chosen.

 2. Line 66: When handling passwords, raising an HTTPConflict if a password
    already exists might not be the best approach. It could potentially leak
    information about the existence of passwords. Instead, it's better to simply
    overwrite the existing password. However, this depends on the specific use
    case and security requirements. If you intend to enforce a one-time password
    setting, this may be acceptable, but it's something to be aware of.

 3. Lines 67-69: There's a potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability here.
    If req.content_length or len(req.body) exceeds MAX_SIZE, the server will
    return a HTTPBadRequest response. An attacker could exploit this by sending
    a large number of requests with oversized bodies, causing the server to
    exhaust its resources. To mitigate this, you could enforce a stricter limit
    on the maximum allowed request size, or implement rate limiting to prevent
    abuse.

Other than these points, the code appears to handle passwords securely and
follows best practices for handling web requests.

Therefore, the revised feedback would be:
