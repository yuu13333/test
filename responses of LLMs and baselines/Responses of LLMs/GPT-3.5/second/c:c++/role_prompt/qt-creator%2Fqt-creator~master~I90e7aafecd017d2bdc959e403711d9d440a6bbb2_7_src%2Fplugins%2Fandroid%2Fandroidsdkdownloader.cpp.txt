Q_LOGGING_CATEGORY(sdkDownloaderLog, "qtc.android.sdkDownloader", QtWarningMsg)
}


The use of anonymous namespaces is generally safe but could potentially lead to
unexpected behavior if there are conflicting definitions within the same
translation unit or if the same name is reused in another translation unit.
Consider using a named namespace to mitigate this risk.

Copy code
// Line 63
if (!file.fileName().contains('.'))


This condition checks if the file name does not contain a dot ('.'). It seems to
assume that a file without an extension should have executable permissions set.
This assumption might not hold true in all cases and could lead to incorrect
permissions being set on certain files. Consider revising the condition to
target specific file types or use a more reliable method to determine
executability.

cpp
Copy code
// Line 116
QString jarCmdPath = jdkPath + QDir::separator() + "bin" + QDir::separator() + "jar";


Constructing a file path using user-supplied or external input (in this case,
jdkPath) without proper validation could lead to path traversal attacks. Ensure
that jdkPath is validated and sanitized to prevent directory traversal
vulnerabilities.

// Line 126
return jarExtractProc->exitCode() ? false : true;


The expression ? false : true is redundant. You can directly return the result
of the conditional expression jarExtractProc->exitCode().

cpp
Copy code
// Line 136
if (basename.isEmpty())


This condition checks if basename is empty. While it ensures a default filename
is used if basename is empty, it might be more appropriate to validate basename
against specific conditions related to valid filenames (e.g., ensuring it does
not contain invalid characters) to prevent potential security issues.

cpp
Copy code
// Line 174
bool AndroidSdkDownloader::isHttpRedirect(QNetworkReply *reply)
{
    int statusCode = reply->attribute(QNetworkRequest::HttpStatusCodeAttribute).toInt();
    return statusCode == 301 || statusCode == 302 || statusCode == 303 || statusCode == 305 || statusCode == 307 || statusCode == 308;
}


The function isHttpRedirect checks if the HTTP status code indicates a redirect
response. While the implementation is correct, it might not cover all possible
redirect status codes. Consider reviewing and updating the function to include
other relevant redirect status codes as needed.
