The code you provided appears to be a utility for converting JSON content to
CBOR format. Upon reviewing the code, I've identified a potential security
issue:

Potential Buffer Overflow: In the decode_base64_generic function (lines 55-101),
the calculated size for the buffer may not be sufficient to hold the decoded
data. The size is calculated based on the input string length, but the actual
decoded data size might be larger. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the
allocated buffer size is not large enough.

Line(s) of code:

 * Lines 57, 58

Proposed Solution: Ensure that the buffer size allocated in
decode_base64_generic is large enough to hold the decoded data. One way to
address this issue is to allocate a buffer size that accounts for the maximum
possible decoded size, rather than relying solely on the input string length.
Additionally, consider using safer alternatives like base64_decode functions
provided by widely-used libraries or using dynamically resizing buffers to
handle arbitrary input sizes safely.

Besides this, the code appears to handle memory allocation and deallocation
properly and utilizes standard functions for string manipulation and
encoding/decoding operations. However, a more comprehensive security review
might involve testing the code with various inputs to ensure robustness and
identify any additional vulnerabilities.
