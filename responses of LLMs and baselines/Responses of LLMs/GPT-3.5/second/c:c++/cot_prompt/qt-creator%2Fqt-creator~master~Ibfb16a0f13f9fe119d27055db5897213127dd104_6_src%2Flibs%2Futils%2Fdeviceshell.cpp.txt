Here are some security defects found in the original code along with their
corresponding line numbers and solutions:

 1. Command Injection Vulnerability:
    
    * Line 104: m_shellProcess->write(command);
    * Description: The code constructs a shell command (command) using
      user-supplied input (cmd.toUserOutput()) without proper validation or
      sanitization. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities, where an
      attacker can manipulate the command executed by injecting malicious
      commands into cmd.
    * Solution: To mitigate command injection, sanitize or validate user input
      before constructing shell commands. Use functions like
      QProcess::setProgram() and QProcess::setArguments() to execute commands
      securely.

 2. Incomplete Input Validation:
    
    * Line 71, Line 129: const CommandLine &cmd, const QByteArray &stdInData
    * Description: The code lacks thorough input validation on the cmd and
      stdInData parameters passed to runInShell and outputForRunInShell
      functions. Insufficient validation can lead to unexpected behavior or
      vulnerabilities when processing user-controlled data.
    * Solution: Implement strict input validation mechanisms, such as checking
      for valid command formats, ensuring data integrity, and preventing
      potential injection attacks (like SQL injection, command injection, etc.).

 3. Potential Information Disclosure:
    
    * Line 104: m_shellProcess->write(command);
    * Description: The code writes the shell command (command) to the shell
      process without obfuscating or encoding sensitive information within the
      command. This could potentially disclose sensitive data if the command
      contains confidential information.
    * Solution: Avoid passing sensitive information directly within shell
      commands. If necessary, ensure sensitive data is properly encrypted or
      obfuscated before being used in shell commands.

 4. Lack of Error Handling:
    
    * Line 260: if (!m_shellProcess->waitForStarted() ||
      !m_shellProcess->waitForReadyRead() ||
      m_shellProcess->readAllStandardOutput() != "\n") {
    * Description: The code lacks comprehensive error handling during the
      startup of the shell process (m_shellProcess). I
