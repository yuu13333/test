Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a potential security defect
related to memory management.


SECURITY DEFECT:

In the QWasmDrag class destructor ~QWasmDrag(), there is a potential memory
leak. The mimeData object is deleted in the destructor, but it may not have been
allocated memory before deletion, which could lead to undefined behavior.


LINE NUMBER:

cpp
Copy code
57     QWasmScreen *wasmScreen;
58     int mimeTypesCount;
59     QMimeData *mimeData; // Declaration of mimeData pointer


cpp
Copy code
QWasmDrag::~QWasmDrag()
{
    delete mimeData; // Deleting mimeData without checking if it's initialized
}



SOLUTION:

To avoid potential memory leaks and undefined behavior, ensure that mimeData is
initialized properly before deleting it. You can initialize mimeData in the
constructor or wherever it's appropriate in your code. Additionally, use smart
pointers like std::unique_ptr or Qt's QScopedPointer for automatic memory
management to avoid manual deletion and potential memory leaks.


REVISED CODE (DESTRUCTOR):

cpp
Copy code
QWasmDrag::~QWasmDrag()
{
    if (mimeData) // Check if mimeData is initialized before deleting
        delete mimeData;
}


With this change, the code ensures that mimeData is only deleted if it has been
properly allocated memory, thus preventing potential memory leaks and undefined
behavior.

No other security defects are detected in the code.
