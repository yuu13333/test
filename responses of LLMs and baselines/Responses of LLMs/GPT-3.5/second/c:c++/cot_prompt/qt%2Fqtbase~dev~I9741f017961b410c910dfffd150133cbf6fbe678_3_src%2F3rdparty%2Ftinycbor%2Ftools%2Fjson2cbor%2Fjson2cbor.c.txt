The original code provided does not appear to have explicit security defects,
but there are some areas that could benefit from improvement to enhance security
measures:

 1. Potential Memory Leaks
    
    * Lines: 58, 105, 127, 150
    * Issue: Memory allocated by malloc is not always freed by free, leading to
      potential memory leaks.
    * Solution: Ensure that memory allocated dynamically is properly released
      using free after its use to avoid memory leaks. For example, in
      decode_base64_generic, decode_base64, decode_base64url, and decode_base16
      functions, free the allocated memory for the buffer variable before
      returning.

 2. Buffer Overflow
    
    * Lines: 45, 41, 31
    * Issue: The buffer variable and meta_data_marker array may be susceptible
      to buffer overflow if the input data exceeds the allocated buffer size.
    * Solution: Use safer functions like strncpy or ensure proper bounds
      checking when manipulating buffer and meta_data_marker to prevent buffer
      overflow vulnerabilities.

 3. Unvalidated Input
    
    * Lines: 307, 432
    * Issue: Input from the user or external sources (e.g., files) is directly
      processed without sufficient validation, potentially leading to
      vulnerabilities such as command injection or file inclusion
      vulnerabilities.
    * Solution: Validate user inputs and ensure proper sanitization of input
      data to prevent malicious inputs from causing unexpected behavior or
      security breaches.

 4. Lack of Error Handling
    
    * Lines: 308, 471, 481
    * Issue: Lack of robust error handling could lead to unexpected program
      behavior or crashes, especially during file operations, memory allocation,
      or JSON parsing.
    * Solution: Implement comprehensive error handling mechanisms, including
      checking return values of functions, handling file I/O errors, and
      gracefully handling JSON parsing failures to improve the program's robustn
