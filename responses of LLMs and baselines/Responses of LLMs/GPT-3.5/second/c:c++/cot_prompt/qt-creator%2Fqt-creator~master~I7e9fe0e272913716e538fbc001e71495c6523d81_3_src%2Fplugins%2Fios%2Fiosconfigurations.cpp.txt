Here are a few security concerns found in the original code along with their
corresponding line numbers and potential solutions:

 1. Insecure Path Concatenation (Line 77, 78, 79, 80):
    
    * Security Concern: Using string concatenation for file paths (e.g.,
      XCODE_PLIST_PATH, PROVISIONING_PROFILE_DIR_PATH, simulatorSDKSettings,
      deviceSDKSettings) can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if
      user-controlled input is used.
    * Line Numbers: 77, 78, 79, 80
    * Solution: Use platform-independent path manipulation functions or classes
      provided by the programming language or libraries to safely handle file
      paths and prevent path traversal attacks.

 2. Command Injection (Line 387, 398):
    
    * Security Concern: Using user input directly in a command executed by a
      process (e.g., path variable in decodeProvisioningProfile function) can
      lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
    * Line Numbers: 387, 398
    * Solution: Validate and sanitize user input before using it in commands.
      Prefer using libraries or APIs that handle command execution securely,
      such as subprocess modules in Python.

 3. Untrusted Deserialization (Line 387, 401):
    
    * Security Concern: Deserializing data from an untrusted source (e.g.,
      decodeProvisioningProfile function) without proper validation can lead to
      deserialization vulnerabilities.
    * Line Numbers: 387, 401
    * Solution: Implement strict input validation and use safe deserialization
      techniques, such as using JSON or XML parsers with proper error handling.

 4. Potential Information Disclosure (Line 318, 320):
