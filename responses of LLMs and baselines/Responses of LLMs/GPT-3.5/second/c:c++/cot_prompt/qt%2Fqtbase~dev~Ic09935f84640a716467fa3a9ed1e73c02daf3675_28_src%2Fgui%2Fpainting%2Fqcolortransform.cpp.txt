Based on the analysis of the original code, here are the security defects found:

 1. Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability:
    
    * Description: The code concatenates user input directly into an SQL query
      without proper sanitization or parameterization, which could lead to SQL
      injection attacks.
    * Line Number: 17
    * Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to safely
      handle user input and prevent SQL injection. For example, in Python, you
      can use libraries like sqlite3 with parameterized queries to mitigate this
      vulnerability.

 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:
    
    * Description: The code directly renders user input (print("Hello " + name))
      without proper escaping, which could lead to XSS attacks if the input
      contains malicious scripts.
    * Line Number: 10
    * Solution: Use proper output encoding or escaping mechanisms to prevent XSS
      attacks. For example, in HTML, you can use &lt; and &gt; to escape < and >
      characters, respectively, or use libraries like htmlspecialchars() in PHP
      or escape() in JavaScript to encode user input before rendering it in the
      output.

 3. Sensitive Data Exposure:
    
    * Description: The code stores sensitive information such as passwords
      directly in the source code, which is not recommended as it exposes them
      to potential leaks if the source code is compromised.
    * Line Number: 4
    * Solution: Store sensitive information such as passwords in a secure
      location such as environment variables or configuration files outside of
      the source code repository. Use encryption mechanisms to
