In the provided code snippet, I didn't notice any immediate security defects
that could lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks,
or insecure handling of sensitive information. The code mainly deals with
networking functionalities and interface management, which don't inherently pose
security risks based on this snippet alone.

However, it's essential to keep in mind that security is a complex and
multifaceted aspect of software development. To ensure the overall security of
the application, additional considerations such as input validation, secure data
transmission, access control, and secure memory management need to be addressed
throughout the application codebase.

Therefore, based on the provided snippet, I would state: No security defects are
detected in the code.
