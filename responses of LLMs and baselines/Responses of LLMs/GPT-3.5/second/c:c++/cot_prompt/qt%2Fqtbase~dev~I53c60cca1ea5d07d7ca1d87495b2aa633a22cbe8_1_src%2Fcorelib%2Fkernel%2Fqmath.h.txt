In the provided code snippets, there are no obvious security defects such as
buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or insecure cryptographic
implementations. The code appears to be focused on mathematical operations and
does not involve handling user input or sensitive data in a way that would lead
to typical security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the analysis results in:

No security defects are detected in the code.
