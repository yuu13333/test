Here are some security issues found in the original code along with their
corresponding line numbers and solutions:

 1. Potential Command Injection in launch function:
    
    * Line Number: 160
    * Security Issue: The launch function constructs a command using
      user-provided data (url) without proper validation or sanitization. This
      can lead to command injection vulnerabilities where an attacker could
      manipulate the url to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
    * Solution: Use proper sanitization and validation techniques (e.g.,
      whitelist validation) to ensure that the url does not contain any
      malicious or unexpected characters that can be interpreted as part of a
      command.

 2. Insecure Temporary File Handling in flatpakSendEmail function:
    
    * Line Numbers: 233-239
    * Security Issue: The flatpakSendEmail function opens files based on URIs
      directly (attachmentUri) without validating whether the URIs are safe or
      pointing to unexpected locations. This can be exploited by an attacker to
      read or write arbitrary files on the system.
    * Solution: Implement strict validation checks on attachmentUri to ensure
      that it only points to expected and safe locations. Use proper file
      handling techniques such as secure temporary file creation and management
      to prevent unauthorized access.

 3. Potential Privilege Escalation in flatpakSendEmail and flatpakOpenURI
    functions:
    
    * Line Numbers: 204, 251
    * Security Issue: The functions flatpakSendEmail and flatpakOpenURI make
      DBus calls without performing adequate checks on the calling process's
      privileges. This can lead to potential privilege escalation attacks if the
      caller does not have sufficient privileges to perform these actions.
    * Solution: Implement proper privilege checks before making DBus calls.
      Ensure that only authorized processes with the necessary privileges can
      invoke these functions.

 4. Hardcoded Credentials in detectWebBrowser function:
    
    * Line Numbers: 133-137
    * Security Issue: The detectWebBrowser function attempts to read default
      browser settings from environment variables (DEFAULT_BROWSER and BROWSER)
      without considering the security implications. Hardcoded or default
      credentials can be exp
