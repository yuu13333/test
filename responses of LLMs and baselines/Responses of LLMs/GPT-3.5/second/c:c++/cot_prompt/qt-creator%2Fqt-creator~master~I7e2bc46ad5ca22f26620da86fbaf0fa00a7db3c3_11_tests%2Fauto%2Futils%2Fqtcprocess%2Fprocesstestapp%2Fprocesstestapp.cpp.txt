Upon analyzing the original code, I found no explicit security defects. However,
there are some practices that could potentially introduce security
vulnerabilities if not handled properly:

 1. Use of Environment Variables (Line 59): The code checks for the presence of
    environment variables to determine the behavior of the program. While this
    is a common practice, it's important to ensure that these variables are
    sanitized and validated before use to prevent any injection attacks or
    unintended behavior. Ensure that the environment variables are used safely
    and not manipulated by untrusted sources.

 2. Command Execution (Line 102): The code constructs a command line using a
    file path without proper validation. If the s_pathToProcessTestApp variable
    is set by user input or can be manipulated externally, it could lead to
    command injection vulnerabilities. Always sanitize and validate user inputs
    before constructing command lines to prevent command injection attacks.

 3. Resource Exhaustion (Lines 179, 180): The InfiniteSleep block type in the
    KillBlockingProcess function can potentially lead to a denial-of-service
    (DoS) attack if the process is invoked with this block type and allowed to
    execute indefinitely. Ensure that the application has mechanisms in place to
    limit the execution time of such operations to prevent resource exhaustion
    attacks.

 4. Crash Handling (Lines 199, 204): The code explicitly crashes the application
    in certain scenarios (doCrash() function). While this might be intentional
    for testing purposes
