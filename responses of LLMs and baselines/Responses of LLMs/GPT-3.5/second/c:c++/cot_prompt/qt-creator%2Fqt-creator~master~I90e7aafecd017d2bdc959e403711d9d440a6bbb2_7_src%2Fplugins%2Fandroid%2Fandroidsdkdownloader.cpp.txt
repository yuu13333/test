Here are some security issues found in the original code along with their
corresponding line numbers and potential solutions:

 1. Insecure HTTP URL Usage (Line 101-115, Line 185-203)
    
    * Security Defect: The code downloads SDK tools and packages using HTTP URLs
      (http://), which can be vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
      Attackers can intercept and modify the downloaded files, leading to
      potential security breaches.
    * Solution: Use secure HTTPS URLs (https://) for downloading files to ensure
      data integrity and confidentiality. Additionally, implement certificate
      validation to verify the server's identity.

 2. Lack of Input Validation (Line 136-154)
    
    * Security Defect: The getSaveFilename function does not validate input URL
      paths, potentially allowing malicious input to manipulate file paths and
      perform directory traversal attacks.
    * Solution: Implement strict input validation to ensure that the filename is
      safe and does not contain any directory traversal characters (../, ..\,
      etc.). Use whitelisting or sanitization techniques to validate input.

 3. Hardcoded Paths (Line 116)
    
    * Security Defect: The path to the jar command is hardcoded, which can be a
      security risk if the path is predictable or known to attackers, enabling
      them to execute arbitrary commands.
    * Solution: Use environment variables or configuration files to dynamically
      set the path to the jar command. Avoid hardcoded paths to prevent
      exploitation.

 4. Potential Memory Leaks (Line 120, Line 131)
    
    * Security Defect: The code creates a new QProcess object (jarExtractProc)
      without proper memory management, potentially leading to memory leaks and
      resource exhaustion.
    * Solution: Ensure proper cleanup and deletion of QProcess objects
