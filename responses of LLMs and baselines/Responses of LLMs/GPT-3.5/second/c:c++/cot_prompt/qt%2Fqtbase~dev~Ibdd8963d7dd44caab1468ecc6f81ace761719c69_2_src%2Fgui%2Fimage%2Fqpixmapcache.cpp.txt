Upon reviewing the provided code, I didn't detect any obvious security defects
that could lead to vulnerabilities such as memory corruption, injection attacks,
or unauthorized access. The code seems well-structured and follows best
practices for memory management, thread safety, and input validation. Therefore,
I would say:

No security defects are detected in the code.

However, it's essential to mention that thorough security testing, including
code reviews, static analysis, and dynamic testing, should always be conducted
in real-world applications to ensure robust security posture.
