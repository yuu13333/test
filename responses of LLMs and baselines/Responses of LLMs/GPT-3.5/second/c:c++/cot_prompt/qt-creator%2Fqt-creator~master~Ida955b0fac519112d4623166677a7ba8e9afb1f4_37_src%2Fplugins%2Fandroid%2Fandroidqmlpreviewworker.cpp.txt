Upon analyzing the original code, I have found a potential security defect:

 1. Command Injection in runAdbCommandAsyncAndWait:
    * Description: The function runAdbCommandAsyncAndWait constructs a command
      to run adb asynchronously and then waits for the result. However, it
      constructs the command by concatenating strings without proper
      sanitization, which could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
    * Line Number: Lines 97-110
    * Solution: Instead of constructing the command using string concatenation,
      use QProcess or QProcessBuilder with proper argument passing to avoid
      command injection. For example, use QProcess::start with a list of
      arguments.

Other than the mentioned security defect, no other security defects are detected
in the code.
