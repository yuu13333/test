Upon analyzing the original code, no specific security defects related to
vulnerabilities like injection attacks, buffer overflows, or unauthorized access
are apparent. However, I can provide some general security guidelines for OpenGL
programming to ensure robustness:

 1. Input Validation:
    
    * Potential Issue: If the code receives input from untrusted sources (like
      user input or network data), it should be validated to prevent injection
      attacks.
    * Line Number: Not applicable in the provided code.
    * Solution: Implement input validation techniques such as parameter
      validation, input sanitization, and using whitelists for acceptable input.

 2. Memory Safety:
    
    * Potential Issue: The code does manual memory management (new, delete)
      which can lead to memory leaks or buffer overflows if not handled
      carefully.
    * Line Number: Lines involving manual memory management (e.g., new, delete).
    * Solution: Consider using smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr)
      or RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) techniques to manage
      memory automatically and prevent leaks or overflows.

 3. Access Control:
    
    * Potential Issue: The code doesn't explicitly check access control or
      permissions for certain operations, assuming all operations are
      legitimate.
    * Line Number: Not applicable in the provided code.
    * Solution: Implement access control mechanisms based on user roles or
      privileges to ensure that sensitive operations are only performed by
      authorized users.

 4. Secure Coding Practices:
    
    * Potential Issue: Lack of explicit error handling and logging mechanisms
      can make it difficult to identify and troubleshoot security issues.
    * Line Number: Not applicable in the provided code.
    * Solution: Implement proper error handling with informative error messages
      and logging to record potential security incidents or abnormal behaviors.

Overall, while the provided code doesn't exhibit specific security defects,
incorporating these general security practices can enhance the robustness and
security posture of the a
