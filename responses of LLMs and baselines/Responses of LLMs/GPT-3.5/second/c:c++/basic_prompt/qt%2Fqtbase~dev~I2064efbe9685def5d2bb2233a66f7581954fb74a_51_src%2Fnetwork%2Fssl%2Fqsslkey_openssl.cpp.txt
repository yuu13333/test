The code seems to be mainly focused on OpenSSL integration and handling SSL
keys. Let's review it for security defects:

 1. Memory Management:
    
    * Line 56: The function clear(bool deep) is responsible for memory
      deallocation, but it's not entirely secure. If deep is set to true, it
      frees the internal structures (like RSA, DSA, EC keys), but it does not
      set them to null afterward. An attacker could potentially exploit this by
      accessing freed memory.
    * Solution: After freeing memory, set the corresponding pointers to null.

 2. Memory Leaks:
    
    * Line 122: In the fromEVP_PKEY function, memory allocated for ec is not
      freed if algorithm is not QSsl::Ec. This might lead to a memory leak.
    * Solution: Free ec memory in the else block after line 136.

 3. Input Validation:
    
    * Line 161: The function q_BIO_new_mem_buf is called without checking if pem
      is NULL. This might lead to a NULL pointer dereference if pem is empty.
    * Solution: Add a check for pem before calling q_BIO_new_mem_buf.

 4. Incomplete Handling of Return Values:
    
    * Line 166, 172, 179: After reading PEM data, the return value result is not
      checked against NULL. If the read operation fails, it may result in
      uninitialized memory usage or other unexpected behavior.
    * Solution: Check the return value result against NULL and handle the error
      condition appropriately.

 5. Resource Management:
    
    * Line 162: The phrase variable is used after it's been potentially
      invalidated by being passed into q_PEM_read_bio_RSA_PUBKEY or
      q_PEM_read_bio_RSAPrivateKey. This might lead to undefined behavior.
    * Solution: Ensure that phrase remains valid until its usage is complete.

 6. Buffer Overflow:
    
    * Line 320: The output buffer is resized to data.size() +
      EVP_MAX_BLOCK_LENGTH. This might lead to a buffer overflow if
      EVP_MAX_BLOCK_LENGTH is underestimated or if data.size() is very large.
    * Solution: Ensure that the buffer size calculation is accurate and that it
      won't overflow.

 7. Cryptography Weakness:
    
    * Line 323, 345: The function q_EVP_CIPHER_CTX_reset is called, but its
      return value is not checked. If it fails, subsequent operations might lead
      to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    * Solution: Check the return value of q_EVP_CIPHER_CTX_reset and handle
      errors appropriately.

These are some potential security issues found in the code. Implementing the
suggested solutions should enhance the security of the codebase.
