No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code does not include any operations that are obviously insecure. The code snippet primarily consists of class declarations, including a move constructor and move assignment operator, which are used for move semantics in C++. The operations performed within these methods, based on the given code snippet, simply swap pointers, which is a standard operation when implementing move semantics and does not in itself introduce a security defect.

However, it is important to keep in mind that assessing security fully would require a more thorough review, including the actual implementation of functions and the management of resources to ensure that there is no risk of resource leaks or other potential security issues.

In this case, without the implementation details of `QTemporaryDir`, particularly how the raw pointer `d_ptr` is managed across the class, the assessment of security defects in the code is limited to the information presented in the snippet. Moreover, any associated unit tests, if provided, would also be reviewed to ensure that all edge cases have been considered.
