After scrutinizing the provided code, which is primarily involved with mathematical computations and inline function definitions, I can affirm that:

No security defects are detected in the code.

The code doesn't seem to perform operations that typically involve security risks, like memory allocation, file operations, or network communications, which are common areas where security vulnerabilities could occur. Instead, it focuses on mathematical functions which are generally safe as long as the input values are within acceptable ranges for the operations being performed. The code consists of mathematical utilities provided by the Qt framework and follows the standard practice for such implementations.
