I have analyzed the code and found no security defects. If there were any flaws within the provided code snippet relating to security concerns such as improper handling of certificates, memory leaks, buffer overflows, or other vulnerabilities, I would describe the issue in detail, including the line numbers and recommend a solution. However, since the code snippet is well-structured and doesnâ€™t exhibit any immediately obvious security issues within the examined sections, my conclusion is:

'''No security defects are detected in the code'''.

Please note that a thorough code review for security defects might include an examination of the entire codebase, potential interactions with other software components, and the context in which this code runs. My analysis is limited to the provided code. It is always recommended for a comprehensive security audit to be conducted by professionals that have access to the full codebase, dependencies, and the environment where the code gets executed.
