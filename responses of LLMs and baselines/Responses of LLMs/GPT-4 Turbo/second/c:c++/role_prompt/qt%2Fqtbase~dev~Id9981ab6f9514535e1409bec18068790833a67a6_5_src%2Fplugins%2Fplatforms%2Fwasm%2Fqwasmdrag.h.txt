From reviewing the code you've provided, there doesn't seem to be any visible security defects. However, there are some factors worth mentioning that could lead to potential issues within different contexts or if modifications are made to this code.

Firstly, at line 57, 'QWasmScreen *wasmScreen;'. Here, you've got a pointer to an object, which always carries the risk of causing issues such as null pointer dereferences or dangling pointers. You should always ensure that pointers are always pointing to an actual object and not deallocated during the lifespan of this QWasmDrag class instance.

Second, at line 59 'QMimeData *mimeData;'. This is another pointer that needs to be carefully managed. If QMimeData object pointed to by 'mimeData' is managed outside this class and is destructed prematurely, this can lead to issues.

Please note again that these are simply potential risks, and they're not security defects without additional context. In this provided code snippet, there are no direct security defects. However, special attention needs to be accorded to pointers in a broader context. The management and lifespan of the pointed objects should be carefully considered when integrating this class with other parts of software. 

In that final analysis, '''No security defects are detected in the code'''.
