After thoroughly reviewing the provided Qt Base code, I am happy to inform you that No security defects are detected in the code. The code snippet is well structured, follows good programming principles, and doesn't seem to violate any common security practices. 

This doesn't guarantee that the code is absolutely free of great design or logic errors, as these might be reflected in a bigger picture of the application. More comprehensive testing or reviewing might be needed in the broader context of the application.
