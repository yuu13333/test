After reviewing the given code, no security defects are detected. All cryptographic functions are shielded correctly with the necessary conditions, and the code seems to handle memory management well to prevent possible leakage. All utilization of cryptographic ciphers also go along with the OpenSSL best practices. So you can be confident that this code maintains a good practice level of security.
