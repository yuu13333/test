After a thorough review of the provided code, it appears to be well-structured and secure. The code contains initialization for the SSL context, sets up the cipher list, certificate, private key; it ensures the private key is certified by the public key, and sets up peer verification, Diffie-Hellman parameters, and elliptic curves. All the necessary error checking statements are in place to catch potential pitfalls. Thus, I can state confidently:

No security defects are detected in the code.
