Based on my analysis, there are no security defects detected in the code provided.

The code snippets contain license information and imports of various libraries but do not exhibit any commonly known security issues as specified by the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. Most of the code involves the initialization and configuration of Docker containers and processes within the Qt Creator environment, without obvious vulnerable code patterns such as buffer overflows, unvalidated inputs, or insecure cryptographic practices.

Remember, the absence of detected vulnerabilities does not guarantee the code is 100% secure. It's always a good practice to perform more comprehensive security testing, including dynamic analysis and penetration testing, for critical applications.
