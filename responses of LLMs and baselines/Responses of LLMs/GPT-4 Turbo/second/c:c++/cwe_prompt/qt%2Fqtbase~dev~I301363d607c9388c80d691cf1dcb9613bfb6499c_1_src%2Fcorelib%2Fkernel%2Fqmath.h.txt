After reviewing the code provided, focusing on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) as a reference for security defects, it appears there are no explicit security vulnerabilities within the provided code snippet. This code primarily involves mathematical functions and constants definitions, which, in themselves, do not exhibit typical security issues such as buffer overflows, SQL injections, or improper access control. 

The code practices, such as the inclusion guards (lines 40-41, 383), use of modern C++ features (e.g., `constexpr`, `template` usage), and adherence to encapsulation (`QtPrivate` namespace), suggest good coding practices that minimize the likelihood of introducing CWE-relevant defects. 

Furthermore, the use of `std` library functions and the conditional compilation techniques used for feature detection (lines 50-52) follow best practices for avoiding undefined behavior and ensuring compatibility, rather than security defects per se.

However, it's worth noting that while this specific review did not identify security defects related to CWE, maintaining security involves consistent review and testing, especially when changes are made or new features are added. Additionally, the security implications of this code might depend on how it's used in broader applications, which could introduce vulnerabilities not apparent from this isolated review. 

In summary: 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
