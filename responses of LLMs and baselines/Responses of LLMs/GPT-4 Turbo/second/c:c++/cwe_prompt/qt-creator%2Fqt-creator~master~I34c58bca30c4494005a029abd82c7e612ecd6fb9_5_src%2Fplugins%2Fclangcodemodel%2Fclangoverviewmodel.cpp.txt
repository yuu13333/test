I've reviewed the code you've provided with regard to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) security defects. Based on the content and the context of the code snippets shared, no explicit security defects regarding the CWEs listed in the initial request are detected in the code provided.

This does not necessarily mean the code is perfectly secure. A more thorough review, possibly with a higher level of access to the complete project context—including how various functions and libraries are used—might uncover more subtle issues not immediately visible from the snippets provided. Security requires ongoing vigilance and, ideally, should include automated tools, code reviews, and penetration testing as part of a comprehensive security strategy.
