After analyzing the provided code, I found one potential security defect relating to CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion'). 

The issue lies in the fact that you are allowing a potentially large number of connections to your local server, as specified by the `connections` variable, without enforcing any limits. This could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if a large number of connections are continuously opened up by a malicious actor, filling up all available connection slots and causing a Denial of Service.

This vulnerability is relevant to the entire code, but specifically the `pingPong` function on lines 136-161 and the `dataExchange` function on lines 163-194, as they both initialize the `ServerThread` and `SocketFactory` classes, and thereby open up the server for connections.

Here are a couple of recommendations to fix this:

1) Implement connection limiting: You could enforce a maximum number of simultaneous connections to your server, and reject/queue further connections once this limit is reached, reducing the chance of resource exhaustion.

2) Regular monitoring/review of connection logs: Regular monitoring can help identify unusual traffic patterns and take necessary action.

Keep in mind that security is multifaceted and this is just one of many potential vulnerabilities. For comprehensive security testing, consider using static analysis tools, dynamic analysis tools, and/or pen-testing.
