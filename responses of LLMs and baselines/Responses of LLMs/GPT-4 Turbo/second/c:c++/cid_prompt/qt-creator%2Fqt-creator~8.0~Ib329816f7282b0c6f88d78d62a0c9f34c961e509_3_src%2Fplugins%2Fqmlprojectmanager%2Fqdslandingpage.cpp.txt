I have reviewed the provided code. The analysis was conducted based on the provided Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) categories. After thorough examination, it appears that the code does not contain any security defects. The code, primarily involved in the management of landing page functionality for a Qml application, doesn't seem to have any issues in terms of access control, incorrect calculations, resource control, protection mechanism, exception handling, inadequate control flow, and the rest of the provided security categories. Safety measures such as properly disposal of resources via `deleteLater()` have been implemented. Also, no clear hard-coded sensitive data or crucial literals have been identified. As far as good practices are concerned, the code seems to adhere to standard naming conventions and coding standards.

So, to sum it up, 'No security defects are detected in the code'. It's always beneficial to have multiple sets of eyes review the code, so you might consider having another round of code review.
