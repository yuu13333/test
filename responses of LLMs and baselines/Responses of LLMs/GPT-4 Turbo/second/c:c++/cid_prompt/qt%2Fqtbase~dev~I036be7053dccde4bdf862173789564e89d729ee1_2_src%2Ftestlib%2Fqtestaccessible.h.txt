After reviewing the provided code, I didn't find any security defects pertaining to the listed Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types. Here are the details for each of them:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) - The code doesn't seem to work with any sensitive data or resources that might require access control, so there don't appear to be any defects of this type.
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities) - The code doesn't involve interaction with multiple entities that could lead to concurrency or improper interaction issues.
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) - The code uses proper construction/destruction patterns and seems to manage resources correctly.
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation) - The code doesn't have any complex calculations which would pose a risk of calculation errors.
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management) - Control flow seems properly managed and I didn't notice significant gaps or mistakes that could compromise program flow.
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure) - As it is not directly involving any protection mechanisms, this code is not exposed to such risk.
7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison) - All comparisons in the code look correct respecting the types and values they handle.
8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions) - The code checks for 'nullptr' where necessary and no obvious improper exceptional conditions found.
9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization) - This code doesn't work with inputs that can suffer from neutralization flaws.
10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards) - Proper coding standards seem to be followed.

In conclusion, no security defects are detected in the code.
