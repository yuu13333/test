After evaluating the provided code snippet according to the mentioned types of Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), I observe that there are no security defects. The code snippet seems to be a standard usage of QWaitCondition, QDeadLineTimer, QMutex and condition_variables in the Qt library, with a condition and mutex for Integrity OS differentiated. Therefore, there's no CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities), CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime), CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation), CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management), CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure), CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison), CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions), CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization), nor CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards). 

Hence, this statement: 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
