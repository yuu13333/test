After carefully examining the provided code for the potential security defects pertaining to the specified Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE), here is the assessment:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): The code does not appear to implement any explicit access control mechanism. Thus, it's not possible to analyze defects relevant to CWE-284.

2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities): The provided code does not involve interaction between multiple entities.

3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime): There is a destructor at line 56 which, assuming it's properly implemented, should ensure that resources are correctly managed throughout their lifetime. However, without access to the actual implementation, we cannot fully validate this.

4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): There are calculations determining the heights, offsets, and number of rows (among other things) in this code. While everything seems logically consistent, without understanding the actual use case and the full context, it can't be confirmed as being complete.

5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): The control flow of the code appears to be well-managed, with no identifiable loops or conditions that would cause issues. 

6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): The provided code does not appear to implement any explicit protection mechanism, hence CWE-693 can't be evaluated accurately.

7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): The code does not seem to have any explicit comparison operations that could lead to a defect.

8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): Exception handling is not explicitly present in the provided code.

9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): Since the code does not take in any user inputs directly, it is not vulnerable to input-based attacks that would require neutralization.

10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): The code seems to follow correct coding standards, with proper indentation, consistent naming conventions, appropriate use of access modifiers, and clear segmentation of sections. 

Thus, to conclude: "No security defects are detected in the code". Keep in mind, this analysis is based on the provided piece of code and it's always a good practice to conduct an exhaustive security code review considering the full context and purpose of the code.
