After carefully reviewing the provided code, no security defects related to the given CWEs were detected. Here is a brief explanation:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): The code does not seem to involve authorization mechanisms that control or limit access to certain functionalities or data. Access control isn't directly applicable here.

2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities): The code primarily deals with serial port interactions, without indicating complex interactions between multiple entities that could lead to concurrency issues or shared resource problems.

3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime): The lifetime of the QSerialPort resource seems to be managed correctly within the SerialControl object.

4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): There are no complex calculations in the code which could be prone to error. 

5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): Control flow seems properly managed in the code, with errors and exceptions being handled correctly.

6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): The code does not involve implementing security measures (like encryption, hashing, or secure communication), so this CWE-693 is not applicable.

7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): The comparisons in the code correctly use the '==' operator and arg function.

8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): Exceptional conditions such as open errors, write errors, read errors, etc., are appropriately handled in the code (lines 221-230).

9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): The code doesn't involve the input of any data that needs to be neutralized, so this CWE-707 isn't applicable.

10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): The code obeys common coding standards.

However, you might consider improving the creation of Utils::OutputFormatter in line 142, as it does not seem to be deleted later which can result in a memory leak.

Also, it may be worth noting that error handling (CWE-703) could be extended to more specific error feedback, as currently, several errors give the same feedback (e.g., lines 221-230). This might not necessarily be a security defect, though, but rather a matter of user experience and debugging facilitation.

But a thorough code review should be performed by a software engineer or a team of developers familiar with the entire codebase and its context. This will ensure that there are indeed no hidden or secondary issues with the code.
