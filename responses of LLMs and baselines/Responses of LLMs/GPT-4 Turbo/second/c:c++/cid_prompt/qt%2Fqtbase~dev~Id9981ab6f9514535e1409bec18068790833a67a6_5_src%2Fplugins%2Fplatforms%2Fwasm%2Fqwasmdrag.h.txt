After thoroughly inspecting your provided code, there are no security defects detected based on the CWE types mentioned in the request. This code mainly constitutes the definitions of a simple class named `QWasmDrag` that extends `QSimpleDrag`, as part of the QT framework, distinguished by fairly standard and safe functionality.

To explain a little further, the listed methods don't seem to be accessing resources improperly, executing incorrect calculations, managing control flow inadequately, or applying improper comparison. Furthermore, there are no signs of incorrect interactions between multiple entities, protection mechanism failure, improper check or handling of exceptional conditions, improper neutralization, or failure to adhere to coding standards either. 

Please note that this review assumes that the methods which are overridden like `drop` and `move` are done so correctly, and additional code relating to how objects of this class are used would need to be evaluated to provide a more complete security review.
