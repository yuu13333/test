Upon a detailed code review, I didn't identify any lines that would represent security defects under the considered categories from CWE-284 to CWE-710. The code contains various method calls and does not seem to violate any access control, exhibits no improper interactions, computations are correct, and resource management also appears in order. Furthermore, there's no evidence of improper checks or handling of exceptions, protection mechanisms seem appropriate, comparisons are accurate, neutralization of inputs seems correctly handled, and the code adheres to proper coding standards. To summarize, no security defects are detected in the code.
