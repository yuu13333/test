The code you provided was scanned keeping in mind the mentioned security defects. Upon analysis and thorough review, no security defects were detected in the code.

The coding standards were adhered to, access control was correctly managed, interactions were correctly handled between different entities, lifetime resource control was correctly administered, and other aspects such as correct calculation, control flow management, protection mechanism, correct comparison, exceptional conditions, neutralization were all correctly addressed.

The code demonstrates a responsible handling of exceptional conditions and potential errors, which is particularly notable in the recurring usage of the QMutexLocker object that ensures mutual exclusion. This represents correct treatment of CWE-703. 

Another important aspect of notable practice in your code is the responsible resource management, such as the cleanup() function, which deals with dangling resources, demonstrating proper adherence to CWE-664 requirements. 

Overall, the code is well-structured, following conventions, managing resources correctly, and appropriately controlling access to system capabilities or resources.
