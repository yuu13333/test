After carefully reviewing your code based on the specified Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) such as CWE-284, CWE-435, and so on up to CWE-710, I have found that no security defects are detected in the provided code. The code mainly involves implementations related to calendar systems, their registration, and utility functions around date handling without direct security implications evident from the shared snippet. Each function adheres to good coding practices, and there's appropriate handling of resources with no signs of improper access control, incorrect calculations, or other listed vulnerabilities within the visible parts of the code. Therefore, I conclude: 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
