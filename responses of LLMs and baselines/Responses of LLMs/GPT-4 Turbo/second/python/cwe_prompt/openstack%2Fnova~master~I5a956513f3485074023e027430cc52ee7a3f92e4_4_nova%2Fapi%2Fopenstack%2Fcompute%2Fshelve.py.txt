Based on the review of the code snippet provided, I have not identified any specific lines of code that would represent a clear security defect according to the principles outlined in the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). The code appears to have taken measures to consider exception handling, user authorization, and validation of instance status before performing operations.

However, there's always a need for comprehensive testing to validate the behavior in all edge cases. It's worth checking on potential security vulnerabilities that might not be directly apparent in the provided code such as:

1. Potential for Network Issues/DoS attacks: Depending on the service's usage scenario, flooding the service with requests could potentially cause issues - DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service).

2. Ensure that the compute API (compute.API()) and network API (network.API()) used in this code have proper security measures in place.

3. While the code handles exceptions to a certain extent, there should be a mechanism to log these exceptions (while avoiding sensitive details in logs). 

Remember, always have your full program reviewed by a security professional to ensure its safety, as isolated code snippets can only provide limited perspectives.
