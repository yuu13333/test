Reviewing the provided code with the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) reference for security defects, there are a couple of points worth mentioning. However, do note that a comprehensive security review may require more context about how the system overall interacts with this code, especially concerning data input sources and authorization controls. Based on the CWE, here are potential concerns:

1. **Use of Insecure Default Value (CWE-453)**: The default values for configurations `router_distributed`, `l3_ha`, and others are fetched directly from the configuration (`cfg.CONF`) with no evident validation regarding their security implications (lines 30-31, 34-37). If the defaults are insecure or if they can be manipulated, it might present an opportunity for an attacker to influence these settings to their advantage.

    **Solution**: Ensure that the default values provided in the configuration are secure by default. Conduct a review of the configuration settings to make sure they are not overly permissive. Additionally, implementing explicit validation for these values before their use in the application could mitigate risks.

2. **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)**: There appears to be a lack of explicit authorization checks before performing operations that alter router configurations (e.g., `set_extra_attr_value` function on line 60). This could allow unauthorized users to modify router settings if they can invoke this method.

    **Solution**: Implement authorization checks to ensure that only privileged users can alter router configurations. Use role-based access control (RBAC) or similar mechanisms to verify that the calling user has the necessary permissions to execute these operations.

3. **Potential Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209)**: The error message on line 80 might reveal details about the system's internal state (i.e., which keys are expected in the extra attributes table) that could be useful to an attacker.

    **Solution**: Generic error messages should be used to avoid giving away detailed system internals. Instead of specifying the key that doesn't exist, a more general error message could be returned to the user to avoid potential information leakage.
   
It's important to note that for a deeper security assessment, more details about the system context, data flow, and overall application architecture would be needed. Additionally, these points highlight possible concerns based on the CWE standards, but they do not represent an exhaustive security analysis.
