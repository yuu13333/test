Upon review of your provided code, it was observed that there is a potential security risk. Specifically, a CWE-259: Hard-Coded Password was detected in the code.

The security defect is on Line 65, where a hardcoded password '1234pass' is being used. This could potentially allow unauthorized users who gain access to the source code to easily breach the system. 

To fix this issue, a good practice would be to avoid using hardcoded passwords. Instead, a system should be implemented where users are able to securely create, store, and change their own passwords. Make sure to use methods that apply strong encryption to passwords for secure storage and transmission. 

The revised portion of your code could look something like this:

65 body={'changePassword': {'adminPass': securepass}})

In this case, 'securepass' would be obtained from the user in a secure way, and the appropriate encryption applied. Please ensure to replace 'securepass' by a function appropriate to your context that is able to return a securely obtained and properly encrypted password.
