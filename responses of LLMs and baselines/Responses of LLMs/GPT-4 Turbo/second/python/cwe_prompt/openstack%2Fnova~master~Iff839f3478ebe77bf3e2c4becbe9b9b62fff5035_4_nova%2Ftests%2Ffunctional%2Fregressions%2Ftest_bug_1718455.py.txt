The provided code seems to be secure and it does not appear to have critical security defects referring to the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards. The inputs are not taken from an untrusted source, it doesn't seem to have injection points, and system resources are managed properly without mishandling that could lead to confidentiality, integrity, or availability issues. The code also has not used any insecure or weak cryptographic protocols that would leave the system vulnerable to attackers. Therefore, you can use the following statement:

'No security defects are detected in the code'.
