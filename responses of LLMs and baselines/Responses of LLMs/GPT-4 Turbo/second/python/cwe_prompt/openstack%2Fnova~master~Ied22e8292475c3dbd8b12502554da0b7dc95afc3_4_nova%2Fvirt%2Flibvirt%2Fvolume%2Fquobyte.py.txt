Upon examining the provided code, one thing that stands out is the Insufficient Resource Access Control (CWE-732). This issue is present in the following code segments:

Line number: 60
Code: `utils.execute(*command, run_as_root=True)`

Line number: 68
Code: `utils.execute('umount.quobyte', mnt_base, run_as_root=True)`

Line number: 95
Code: `utils.execute(*command)`

These code lines are executing system commands with elevated privileges. This practice can have significant security implications if the code paths leading to these call sites can be influenced by malicious actors. While the current context may not provide direct evidence of such influence, itâ€™s best to avoid running code with elevated privileges as a precaution.

Solution: 
To mitigate this issue, you should consider finding alternatives to this approach. This may involve dividing your code into sections that require elevated privileges and those that do not. This division will help lessen the potential for unintended elevation of privileges. A safeguard should also be added to ensure the integrity of the commands being executed.

Furthermore, the specific commands and parameters should be carefully reviewed to ensure they can't be manipulated by any user supplied input or by input from a source that a user controls.

Line number: 49
Code: `if os.path.exists(" /run/systemd/system"):`

The code line above has a leading space, which is a Typographical Error (CWE-483) that refers to the white space as part of a pathname.

Solution:
Remove the leading space: `if os.path.exists("/run/systemd/system"):`

Please fix these issues to make your code more secure.
