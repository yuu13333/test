After thoroughly reviewing the provided code snippet, I found:

'''No security defects are detected in the code'''.

Security analysis can often be exhaustive, and since code snippets can only reveal so much, it's important to ensure that the broader application ecosystem is also secure. This includes reviewing configurations, ensuring secure communication channels, managing dependencies, and implementing secure coding practices throughout the lifecycle of the software. If this code is part of a larger codebase, a complete security audit may be warranted to confidently ascertain the absence of vulnerabilities.
