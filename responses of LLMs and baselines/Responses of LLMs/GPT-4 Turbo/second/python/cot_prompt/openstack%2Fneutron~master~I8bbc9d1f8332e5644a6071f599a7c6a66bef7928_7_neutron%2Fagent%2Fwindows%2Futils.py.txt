No security defects are detected in the code. 

The provided code seems to be predominately aware of the underlying operating system differences and attempts to limit the impact of these within the Windows environment, particularly with regard to subprocess handling and thread management. The use of subprocess with pipes instead of a shell execution reduces the risk of shell injection vulnerabilities, and there doesn't appear to be any raw user input being executed or concatenated into system commands, reducing the risk even further.

That being said, it's always important to keep in mind that code audit for security defects can be complex and requires knowledge about the surrounding system, the libraries used, and the context in which the code operates. If this represents the whole context of the application's subprocess management, it looks like it handles the process creation with an understanding of security best practices. However, an exhaustive security audit would also consider data handling throughout the application, the configuration of the hosting environment, network security, and potential error conditions that might reveal sensitive information or allow for other forms of exploitation.
