Reviewing the provided code segment meticulously for security defects, my observations are based on the principles of secure coding practices and knowledge of common vulnerabilities:

1. **Input Validation**
   The code uses `jsonschema.validate` to validate the incoming query parameters against a predefined schema (`_GET_SCHEMA_1_8`). This is a good practice to ensure that the input adheres to the expected format and type.

2. **Error Handling**
   The code correctly catches `jsonschema.ValidationError` and converts it into a `webob.exc.HTTPBadRequest` error. This means that the application will fail safely by providing a meaningful error message without exposing sensitive information or stack traces to the user.

3. **Usage of External Libraries**
   The code imports and utilizes several external libraries like `jsonschema`, `oslo_log`, and `webob`. It's essential to ensure these libraries are kept up-to-date to prevent potential security vulnerabilities found in outdated versions.

After thoroughly inspecting each functional part of the code, including input validation, error handling, data transformation, and the HTTP response composition, I find that:

'''No security defects are detected in the code'''.

However, it should be noted that a static code analysis like this can only reveal so much, and a more comprehensive analysis including runtime behavior, additional code context, and dependencies would be necessary to assert the code's security with higher confidence. Also, it is important to regularly audit the code with updated security vulnerability databases and use automated security scanning tools for deeper inspection.
