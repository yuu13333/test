After a careful review of the provided code segments, which primarily focus on testing the policies for admin password changes in a Nova compute API context, the following observations are made concerning security defects:

1. **Hardcoded Password in Test Case** (Lines 65-66): The test case `test_change_paassword_policy` uses a hardcoded password (`'1234pass'`). While this is not directly a security defect in the production code, hardcoded passwords in test codes can propagate bad security practices. It is advisable to use dynamically generated passwords even in test environments to reinforce good security practices.

   **Solution**: Substitute hard-coded passwords with dynamically generated ones using secure libraries, or at least use placeholder values fetched from configuration files or environment variables specific to the test environment. This minimizes the risk of embedding potentially harmful practices in the codebase.

2. **Typographical Error in Method Name**: The method name `test_change_paassword_policy` on line 59 has a typo. Though not a security defect, it's crucial for maintaining the code's readability and preventing potential misunderstandings or errors in future code refactorings or reviews.

   **Solution**: Correct the typographical error in the method name to `test_change_password_policy` to accurately reflect its functionality.

Apart from these observations, no direct security defects are identified within the limits of the provided code segments regarding improper handling of sensitive data, lack of input validation, or vulnerabilities to injection attacks. It is important to note that the provided code is scoped to unit tests for policy enforcement in an OpenStack Nova compute API context, and thus the primary focus is on adequacy of the test coverage rather than the broader security aspects of the application's runtime behavior.

Therefore, the statement to be made is: **No security defects are detected in the code** with an advisory note for improvement on the practices surrounding hardcoded values in test scenarios and rectification of the typographical error in the method name for clarity and professionalism in the codebase.
