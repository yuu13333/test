The code seems well written from a security standpoint. Here are a few observations though:

Line 104: The subprocess.Popen construction is generally safe when the executed commands and their parameters are trusted. Since both 'inkscape' and '--shell' are hard-coded, they are trusted making this line safe.

Line 128: Similarly, the subprocess.run constructor is also used here and it's given trusted parameters. The command to run, 'optipng', is hard-coded, and the parameters ('-o7', '-strip', 'all', and png) are either hard-coded or constructed from known safe conditions, making this usage also safe.

Lines 145 & 149: The `find_executable` function is used here to find the executables for 'inkscape' and 'optipng'. This could potentially be a security concern if the PATH can be manipulated to point to malicious executables, but generally this would require either user error or existing system compromise. 

Recommendations: It is important to ensure that the PATH cannot be manipulated to point to malicious executables. 

Aside from the points mentioned, no security defects are detected in the code.
