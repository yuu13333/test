I can observe several areas where the security of this code could be improved:

1. **Uncontrolled Format String (line 155):**
   - On line 155, it's using a format string that takes unspecified input. An attacker could potentially control a format string that could lead to arbitrary command execution and crashes.
   - **Solution**: Avoid using the module-level format string method, and make sure you are only formatting strings with trusted or validated inputs.

2. **Arbitrary Code Execution (line 112, line 122, line 145, line 152):**
   - Shell commands executed per string concatenation on these lines could potentially open up for shell injection attacks. An attacker could potentially control the input string to inject additional malicious shell commands.
   - **Solution**: Avoid invoking shell commands using string concatenation, validate the input, or use functions that allow safer parameterization of commands.

3. **Principle of Least Privilege Violation (line 119, line 123, line 145, line 152):**
   - The code is run as root, violating the principle of least privilege. This refers to the fact that any process should execute with the least amount of privileges required to complete its responsibility.
   - **Solution**: If the root user is not strictly necessary for these operations, consider running the commands with a non-root user or limiting access rights for the process.

4. **Improper Locking (Multiple lock references throughout the code)**:
   - The locking mechanism may not be functioning correctly because locks are removed, and Pythonâ€™s lock is not re-entrant. An attacker may bypass the locking system or cause a deadlock.
   - **Solution**: Never delete locks; instead, lock a mutex object once and then unlock and re-lock it as required. Consider RLock for reentrancy, when needed.

Remember, this does not guarantee that the code is completely safe, it's always a good idea to have your code reviewed by a professional security team or software.
