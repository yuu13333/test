Looking at the provided code, here are the flagged potential security defects:

1. There is potential `CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)` in lines 105 - 108. The section of code creates an admin context and then verifies the token. It is not clear where this admin context is used, potentially allowing for unintended elevation of privileges if not carefully handled.

Suggested fix:
```
# Remove or limit the use of the admin context to avoid major security issues.
ctxt = context.get_admin_context()
```

2. Potential `CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)` detected on line 151. If the `internal_access_path` from `connect_info` is controlled by an untrusted source, it might contain CRLF injection payloads attempting to attack the backend.

Suggested fix:
```
# Properly sanitize 'internal_access_path' before using it to form the request
tsock.send(f"CONNECT {strutils.clean_input(connect_info['internal_access_path'])} HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n")
```

3. There is a potential security issue of `CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)` at the `except Exception:` catch-all block at lines 165 - 172. This block could catch major exceptions that might need to be handled differently.

Suggested fix:
```
# Use specific exception handling to manage each expected exception case
except SpecificException:
  handleException()

# Only use a generic exception handler for exceptions you didn't expect
except Exception as e:
  handleError(e)
```

Please note that more robust security reviews might need access to the full application stack and a detailed understanding of its use case and expected behavior.
