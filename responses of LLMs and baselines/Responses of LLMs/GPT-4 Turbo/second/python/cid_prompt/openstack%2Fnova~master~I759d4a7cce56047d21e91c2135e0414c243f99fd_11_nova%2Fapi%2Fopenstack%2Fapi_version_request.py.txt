Upon reviewing the code you provided, I didn't find any security defects related to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types you mentioned. It's important to note that this code doesn't involve any complex operations or interactions, as it primarily deals with the API versioning for a specific software.

Still, please keep in mind that this doesn't guarantee the complete absence of vulnerabilities in the larger context where this code is used. Always ensure to conduct a comprehensive security review, and keep the software and all its dependencies up-to-date with the most recent and secure versions. 

Remember, while this specific piece of code is apparently free of these particular CWE issues, there could always be hidden issues or problems that only become apparent under certain conditions or in the context of the whole system.
