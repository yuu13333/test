Upon reviewing the provided code, I detected no security defects related to the Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) you specified:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)
7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)
8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)

The code appears to handle resource lifecycles properly and checks exceptional conditions as is standard in the industry. Calculation and comparisons within the code are handled accurately, and there are no evident lapses in access control or protection mechanisms. Moreover, the code adheres to proper coding standards, including proper neutralization of potential issues that could arise through interaction with multiple entities.

No specific line number with security defects was identified since the analysis did not lead to any findings of CWEs as listed.

Therefore, my conclusion is: 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
