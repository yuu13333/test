After reviewing the provided code for security defects based on the listed CWE categories, the code appears to be responsibly handling access control, resource management, and error conditions.

However, due to the limitations of textual analysis and without running dynamic security analysis tools, I cannot confirm with absolute certainty the absence of security defects. Static code analysis tools or security review by a human expert is required for a comprehensive assessment. Based on the textual review, no explicit security defects pertaining to the listed CWE categories were detected in the code. If security vulnerabilities exist, they may be subtle or require deeper contextual understanding that is not evident from the provided code snippet alone.

Therefore, the statement is: 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
