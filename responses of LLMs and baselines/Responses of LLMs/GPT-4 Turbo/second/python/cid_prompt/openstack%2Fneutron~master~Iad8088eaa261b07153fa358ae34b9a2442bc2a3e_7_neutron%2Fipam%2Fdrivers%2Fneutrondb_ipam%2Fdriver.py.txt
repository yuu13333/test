After thoroughly reviewing the code, I have found a security defect that corresponds to:

CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values - Line number 182
The method `_generate_ips` uses Python's `random.randint` for generating IP addresses within a specific range. This function is not suitable for security-sensitive operations because it uses a pseudo-random number generator that is not cryptographically strong. An attacker could potentially predict IP address generation patterns and interfere with IP address allocation. 

To resolve this security defect, you should replace the `random.randint` function with a cryptographically secure random number generator such as `os.urandom` or an equivalent that is suitable for security-sensitive operations. This update should occur wherever `random.randint` is used for IP address generation or other security-sensitive operations.

Also, I want to mention best practice beyond the CWE-IDs you specified:
It is important to ensure regular code audits and updates because relying on a single check could miss vulnerabilities introduced by future code changes or newly discovered vulnerabilities in dependencies. Regularly scheduled code reviews and updates are an essential best practice for maintaining the security of any codebase.
