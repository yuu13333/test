After thoroughly reviewing the provided code against the specified Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types, I did not identify any apparent security defects. Therefore, it can be concluded: 'No security defects are detected in the code'. The absence of identified defects, however, does not guarantee the code's absolute security. Further testing and validation are recommended for security assurance.
