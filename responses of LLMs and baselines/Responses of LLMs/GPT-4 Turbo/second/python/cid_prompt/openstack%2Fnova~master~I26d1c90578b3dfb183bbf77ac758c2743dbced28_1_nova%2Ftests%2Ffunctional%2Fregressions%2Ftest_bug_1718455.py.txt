After thoroughly reviewing the provided code snippet for security defects in terms of the specified Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE), I reached the conclusion that **no security defects are detected in the code** based on the outlined CWE criteria. The logic and structure of the code, including aspects related to access control, resource management, calculation accuracy, control flow, protection mechanisms, and adherence to coding standards, do not explicitly exhibit any vulnerabilities or security weaknesses that align with the enumerated concerns.
