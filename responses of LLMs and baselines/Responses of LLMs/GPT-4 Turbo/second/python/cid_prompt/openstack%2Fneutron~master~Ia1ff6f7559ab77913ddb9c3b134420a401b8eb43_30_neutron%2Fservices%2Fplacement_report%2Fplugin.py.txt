After careful review of the code, I found the following security defects:

1. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): 
   At line number 68 if `len(rps) != 1` it logs the warning and returns the hard-coded dictionary value `{'uuid': None}` at line 76. This could potentially cause problems if the caller function is not properly handling this case. Instead, it should raise a custom exception that can be caught and dealt with accordingly in the caller functions.
   
2. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): 
     The private method `_execute_deferred` doesn't handle exceptions that might be thrown when the deferred function is invoked at line 63. This does not adhere to best practice coding standards. It is advised to always wrap such calls in a try-catch block and handle possible exceptions accordingly.

3. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): 
    At line number 169 there is a call of a private method `_get_agent_by_type_and_host` from out of class context. It may break the control flow because it relies on the method's internal functioning which may cause unhandled exceptions in case of an error within this method. To maintain the proper control flow of the program it is advisable to Avoid using private method from outside the class. Instead, it should have a corresponding public method which calls this private method ensuring the encapsulation of the class.

Please revise the code according to these suggestions to eliminate potential security risks.
