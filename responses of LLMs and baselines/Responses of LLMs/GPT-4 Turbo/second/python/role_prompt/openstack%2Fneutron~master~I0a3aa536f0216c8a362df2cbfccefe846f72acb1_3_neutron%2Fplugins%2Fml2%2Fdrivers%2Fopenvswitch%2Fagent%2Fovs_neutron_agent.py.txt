I'm afraid I won't be able to run actual code or commands directly involving software like OpenStack or Qt, including being unable to act as a code reviewer or directly interact with software systems and environments. However, I can help explain concepts, provide guidance on software development practices, troubleshoot issues based on descriptions you provide, or help with understanding documentation and code snippets you are working with. How may I assist you further?
