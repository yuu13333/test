I have reviewed the provided code and it seems to follow good security principles. The data retrievals and operations are conducted in a manner that doesn't seem to impose any security threats such as unauthorized access or data manipulation. Test cases are also properly set up to ensure the functional correctness of the code which indirectly contributes to the overall security. Therefore, I can confidently state that no security defects are detected in the code.
