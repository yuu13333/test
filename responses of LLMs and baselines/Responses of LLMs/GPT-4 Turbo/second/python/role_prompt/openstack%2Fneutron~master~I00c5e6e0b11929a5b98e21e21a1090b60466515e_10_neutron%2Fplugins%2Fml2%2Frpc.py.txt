After reviewing the provided Neutron RPC callback code sections for security defects, I can state that:

No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code lacks the broader context in which these functions and methods are executed. Therefore, I cannot determine with certainty if there are any security defects resulting from how these functions interact with external systems or data. Considering just the internal logic of the provided code segments, there are no blatant security defects such as insecure data handling, hard-coded credentials, or improper exception handling that would immediately suggest a vulnerability.

However, it's important to note that code review for security defects typically requires a more thorough approach, including analysis of data flow, understanding of the overall architecture, and potentially testing the code for unexpected behaviors in different scenarios. Additionally, developers should ensure that all external input is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and that sensitive data is handled securely throughout the application lifecycle.
