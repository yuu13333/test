Upon an initial review of the provided code, no security defects are detected in the code.

However, it is important to note that this file appears to be a configuration file defining characteristics of an extension used by Neutron in OpenStack. Much of the presented code is variable assignment rather than executable code, which typically has fewer associated security risks. 

The security of this extension as a part of an overall system would be significantly impacted by sections of code that are not shown here such as where these attributes are used and accessed, how the extension interacts with other parts of the system, and the specific implementations of the extension's functions.

So, while this section alone doesn't contain identified security defects, a full review of all related code would be necessary to confidently assess the extension's overall security.
