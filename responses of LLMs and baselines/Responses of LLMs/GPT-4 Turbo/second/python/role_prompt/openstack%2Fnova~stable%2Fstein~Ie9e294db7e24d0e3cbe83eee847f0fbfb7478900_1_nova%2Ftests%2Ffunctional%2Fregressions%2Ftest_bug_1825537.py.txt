After carefully reviewing your code, I noticed that there is a potential for a violation of CWE-664 "Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime". This is demonstrated during the resize operation failure, from lines 35 to 51, where the code may not handle the exception and rollback operations properly when moving from 'host1' to 'host2'.  

The detailed issue is as follows:

According to line 62, where resize operation to 'host2' fails, it's expected that the resource allocation should be properly handled. However, in the lines 65-79, this test reveals a bug (noted by bug 1825537) where allocations are not reverted correctly if `finish_resize` fails, causing the destination node resource provider not to have any allocations. The instance allocations mistakenly remain for the old flavor on the source node's resource provider, even though the instance isn't running or pointed at the source in the database.

It is paramount to handle exceptions properly and ensure resource allocation is correctly reverted in case operations like `finish_resize` fail.

To resolve the issue, I suggest adding an exception handling mechanism during the resizing operation that will properly cleanup or rollback the allocations from the source host if `finish_resize` fails. Additionally, please correct the allocation assignment for both the source and destination resource providers in case of an exception to avoid lingering resources.

Additionally, for lines 75 and 76, instead of keeping the test case as a comment, it should ideally be enabled and pass successfully, ensuring that the destination provider's allocations match the new flavor after resizing, which is currently not the case.

Please note that these are only potential defects and would need thorough testing to ensure they aren't false positives.
