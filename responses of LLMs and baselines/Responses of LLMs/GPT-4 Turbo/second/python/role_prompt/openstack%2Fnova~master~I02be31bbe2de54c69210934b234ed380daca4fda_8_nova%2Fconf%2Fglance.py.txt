Upon review of the provided code, there are few points which, while not necessarily security defects, could benefit from improvements for better security practices. 

1. Line 28-29: The cfg.ListOpt('api_servers'), this could potentially expose sensitive information as the api_servers URLs are in plain text. If there is a necessity to store URLs, it should be stored in encrypted or at least encoded format.

2. Line 39-46: The cfg.BoolOpt('api_insecure'), this is a risky approach to access Glance. It enables SSL requests to Glance without verifying a server certificate against the certificate authorities. It is susceptible to Man-in-the-middle attacks.

Here are the improvements that can be made:

1. For the aforementioned api_servers issue, if possible, consider storing URLs in an encrypted or encoded format and decoded only when it needs to be used. 

2. For the insecure flag, ensure that it is set to False in production or else ensure strong access control and network isolation to mitigate the risks. It's more secure to validate Glance server with another method, e.g., certificate pinning.

Please note that these are not immediate security defects but rather good practices to ensure robustness of the system.
