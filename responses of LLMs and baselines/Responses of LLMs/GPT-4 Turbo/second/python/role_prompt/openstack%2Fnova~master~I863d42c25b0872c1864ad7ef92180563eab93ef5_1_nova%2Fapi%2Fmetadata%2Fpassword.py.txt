After analyzing the given code block, I must say that I detected a few security defects:

1. Unprotected Encryption (Line 32 - Line 38):
The `extract_password()` function is extracting the password as clear text without any form of encryption, which poses a security risk. It's a good practice to at least hash sensitive data like a password. So instead of saving the password as clear text, one could use a hash function to save it. Note that hashing is not encryption. With encryption, you can decrypt the data if you have the key, unlike hashing which is one way.

2. No Password Strength Check (Line 41 - Line 55):
The `convert_password()` function isn't checking the strength of the password, it's just breaking it into chunks. It would be beneficial to check the complexity of the password to ensure it's strong. Adding code to ensure the password meets a minimum standard of complexity (e.g., a mix of alphanumeric and special characters, and has a minimum length) enhances password security.

3. Insufficient Error Reporting (Line 66, 78):
In case of exceptions like HTTPConflict or InstanceNotFound, the message returned is too vague and doesn't truly inform what went wrong, leaving users and potentially security analysts in the dark. Customized and more explanatory exceptions with meaningful error/information messages should be implemented.

4. Potential DDoS Attack (Line 67):
By just rejecting a request when it exceeds a certain size, you are open to a DDoS attack. To handle this, you can limit the number of requests a user can make within a certain timeframe.

Solutions for each point are mentioned along with the problem, please edit the code accordingly to improve security. This way, we can keep the user's password and the system more secure.
