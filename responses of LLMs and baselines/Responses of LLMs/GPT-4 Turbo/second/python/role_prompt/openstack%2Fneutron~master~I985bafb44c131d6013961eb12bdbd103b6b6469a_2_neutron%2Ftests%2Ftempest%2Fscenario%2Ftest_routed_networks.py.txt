The provided code doesn't appear to have any direct security defects. However, there are a few things that can be improved from a best practice perspective, and these might indirectly impact security.

1. Line 112: You're writing a private key to a temporary file and don't appear to be limiting its access restrictions. While it attempts to remove this file in line 134, there's a risk if the process is interrupted before reaching that point, leaving your private key exposed. Solution: You should set more restrictive permissions on the file or use an in-memory mechanism instead of writing the key to a physical file.

2. Line 117, 134-136: You're using shell=True in subprocess.call, which can expose the application to shell injection vulnerabilities if you try to pass user-provided data into it. Solution: Consider writing your subprocess calls in a way that doesn't require shell=True, or ensure that user inputs are properly sanitized before using them.

3. Line 127-130: There's a potential for a Denial-of-service(DoS) attack because the number of retries and the time delay between them is fixed. If an attacker sends multiple failed attempts, it might delay the system processing. Solution: Implement an exponential backoff which adjusts the wait time after each failed attempt.

Remember that security isn't only about what you can see in the code itself. It's also about how the code is used, the data it operates on, and its operating environment. You must remain cognizant of security implications at all times.
