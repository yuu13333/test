After reviewing the provided code, I spotted an aspect that could potentially introduce a security vulnerability.

In line 115, the variable `options` is used to construct the mount command that is later executed as root in line 122. It's being passed directly (*) to `utils.execute`. This means that unfiltered, unvalidated user input could potentially be interpreted as shell metadata and executed as part of the shell command, leading to an OS command injection vulnerability. 

Proposed Solution:
Filter and validate the options input before using it. Alternatively, use an API to interact with the system or another safe way that does not involve direct command execution from user-supplied input. 

Please let me know if there are other areas in the code you want me to pay some extra attention to or assess further.
