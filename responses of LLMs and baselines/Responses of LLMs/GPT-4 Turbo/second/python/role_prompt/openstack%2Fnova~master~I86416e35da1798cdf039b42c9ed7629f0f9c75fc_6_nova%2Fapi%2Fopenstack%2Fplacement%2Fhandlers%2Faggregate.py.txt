After performing a thorough security inspection of the provided Python code, I have concluded that it doesn't seem to contain any explicit security defects. 

The functions appear to be performing their expected operations, without any obvious faults that could lead to security vulnerabilities. There aren't any insecure function calls, no excessive permissions being granted, and proper exception handling appears to have been implemented.

Despite this, it is essential to keep in mind few points for potential future improvements:
- Input validation: Although not explicitly marked as insecure in this specific code, it is always recommended to have strict input validations for functions (in places like lines 65, 83, 96, 98) handling user-supplied or external inputs to resist any malicious or unexpected inputs.
- Commenting: Comments on the code are beneficial for code maintainability and comprehensibility, but they should also be used to inform other developers about the potential security implications of function calls and operations (e.g., lines 100 and 102).
- Secure coding practices: Following secure coding practices and maintaining up-to-date knowledge about evolving threats can help improve the security of the code, and this is something that has to be considered during development.

Therefore, I can confidently state that '''No security defects are detected in the code'''. However, for a comprehensive analysis, a full codebase review is always beneficial to understand the context of these code snippets, as a security flaw might not be directly present in one section of code, but might arise due to the interactions between different parts of the program.
