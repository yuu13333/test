After a close review, no security defects are detected in the code. It seems that the main function correctly initialises the Nova Scheduler, which includes setting up logging and necessary monkey patching, along with proper server and worker creation. Please make sure that the external utility functions and libraries used here are secure and up-to-date, as their vulnerabilities could potentially affect your code.
