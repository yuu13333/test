I've thoroughly reviewed the original code snippet, primarily with a focus on programming best practices, use of resources, memory management, and the principle of least privilege. It encompasses no security defects. It appears to follow secure coding conventions, properly handles memory allocation, and does not execute any high-risk operations that would inherently create security vulnerabilities. Thus, I can solidly confirm:

No security defects are detected in the code.
