Upon examining the code in the context of the generated files, I am pleased to report that no security defects were detected. The code appears to be well-structured and does not expose any obvious vulnerabilities or insecure practices. Please continue with your programming with the confidence that the code has passed this basic security check. Remember that complete security assurance often requires regular checks, comprehensive debugging, and occasionally having a third-party security audit.
