After a detailed analysis of the provided code snippet, focusing on security vulnerabilities that might relate to the recent shift to OpenSSL 1.1 as outlined in the commit message, I found no apparent security defects in the provided code.

This review considered potential issues such as improper handling of cryptographic keys, misuse of OpenSSL APIs that might lead to memory leaks, improper error checking that could lead to undefined behavior, or any use of deprecated or vulnerable OpenSSL functions that would be incompatible with the OpenSSL 1.1 backend as per the commit message's objectives.

The code transitions and OpenSSL version checks (e.g., line 88-92 for deciding between OpenSSL 1.1's API and the legacy approach) are correctly encapsulated under the QT_CONFIG(opensslv11) compiler directive. This adheres to the best practice of maintaining backward compatibility while integrating new backend features.

Additionally, proper clean-up routines (e.g., lines 64, 69, 75, and 81 for RSA, DSA, EC, and EVP_PKEYS types respectively) demonstrate an understanding of OpenSSL's memory management requirements.

However, this assessment is limited to the provided snippet's context and the brief on transitioning to OpenSSL 1.1. It is recommended to perform a holistic security audit on the complete patch set, considering all potential interaction points within the system, to ensure no indirect security defects are introduced by these changes.

In summary, '''No security defects are detected in the code''' from the given context and the intent specified in the commit message.
