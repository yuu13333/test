After reviewing the provided code snippet and considering the context of a secure DTLS UDP server, I would like to point out that a thorough security audit involves multiple facets of the software development lifecycle, including but not limited to code analysis, architecture review, and testing. However, based only on the given code and without the full context or ability to execute tools that would typically be used in a security audit, I can provide a preliminary review.

From what is visible in the provided code snippet, the implementation does several things in favor of security:

1. **No Certificate/Key Configuration:** The code is using PSK (Pre-Shared Key) which doesn't require certificate management. PSK can be secure if the keys are managed properly (line 94), but without a full understanding of how the keys are generated, stored, and exchanged, this could potentially become a security concern.

2. **Peer Verification Mode:** The `QSslSocket::VerifyNone` verification mode (line 95) is used, indicating that peer verification is not performed. This is not necessarily a security defect in the context of PSK, but it's essential to ensure that peer identity is correctly established to prevent Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.

Looking at the code, no glaring security vulnerabilities are apparent within its shown bounds. Here are a few hypothetical issues not directly observable but worth noting for anyone implementing a similar server:

- **PSK Management:** The static PSK hint and manner in which the PSK is provided in `pskRequired`suggest that the keys might be hard-coded or managed insecurely. Best practice would involve secure key derivation, storage, and rotation policies.

- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Given that datagrams are read and processed as they come in without any shown rate limiting or abuse prevention, an attacker could flood the server with UDP packets, potentially leading to a DoS condition. Proper error and rate limiting would be necessary to mitigate this.

- **Resource Management:** Without seeing how resources are managed, there's a potential for resource exhaustion by, for example, an attacker initiating many connections without completing the handshake.

- **Datagram Verification:** The code does not show any mechanisms for verifying the integrity or authenticity of the received datagrams (although this is implicit in the DTLS protocol).

As a summary, '''No security defects are detected in the code'''; however, it is important to remember that such an assertion is made with the understanding that a deeper security review might be necessary for a conclusive analysis, including the parts of the code that are not shown and the operational context of this server.
