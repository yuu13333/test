After carefully reviewing the supplied code from the original query, focusing on potential security vulnerabilities related to the changes suggested by the "commit message," it seems no explicit security defects are present in the snippets provided. The changes mainly deal with modifying data structures and optimizing performance rather than modifying any security-sensitive operations.

Hence, I must state: '''No security defects are detected in the code'''.
