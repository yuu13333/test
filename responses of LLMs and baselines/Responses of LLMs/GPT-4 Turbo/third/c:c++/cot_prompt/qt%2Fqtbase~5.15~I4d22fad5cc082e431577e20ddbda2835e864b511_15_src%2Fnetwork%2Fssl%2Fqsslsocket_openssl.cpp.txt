After a meticulous review of the provided code, it is concluded that there are no detectable security defects in this small snippet. Hence, "No security defects are detected in the code". The encryption aspect has been addressed by the use of a secure protocol, namely TLS v1.3. This code, which runs in a tightly contained and secure environment, has precautions in place that appear to be properly executed and do not exhibit any clear flaws. The session ticket is not openly revealed or even handled but only logged during debugging, which should typically be turned off during deployment, mitigating any risk of leak.

Please bear in mind that this security appraisal is based solely on the small section of code supplied and would not necessarily represent the security of the entire program where this code segment might be used. To ensure the overarching security of an application, comprehensive security analysis and testing are required.
