Apologies, but the code snippet you have shared seems to be incomplete. It is cut-off after the `byteData.truncate` line. Could you please share the complete code snippet for a more comprehensive review? 

Looking into the provided code, I see no security defects. It's worth noting that the security of this portion of the code can depend heavily on other parts of the program or system, such as how the read values are used, what checks are performed before reading, etc. Please share the complete code for a thorough review. 

For the time being, '''No security defects are detected in the code'''.
