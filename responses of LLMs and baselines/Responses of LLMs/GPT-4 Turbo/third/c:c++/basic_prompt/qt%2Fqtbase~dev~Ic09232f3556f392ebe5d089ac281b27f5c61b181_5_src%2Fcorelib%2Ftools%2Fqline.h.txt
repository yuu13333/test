No security defects are detected in the code. 

The code you have provided seems to be a part of the Qt framework, specifically the QtCore module dealing with `QLine` and `QLineF` classes, which are utility classes for handling lines and have nothing to do with security concerns directly. The code focuses on geometric calculations and doesnâ€™t involve any network operations, user input without validation, or operations on the file system which are common sources for security vulnerabilities.

Should you have any more code, especially that which can interact with external systems or handle potentially sensitive data, I'd be glad to review it as well.
