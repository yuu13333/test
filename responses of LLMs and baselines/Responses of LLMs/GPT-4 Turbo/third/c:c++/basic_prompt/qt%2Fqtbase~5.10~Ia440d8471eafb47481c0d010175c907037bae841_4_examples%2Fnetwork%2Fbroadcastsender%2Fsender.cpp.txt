Upon reviewing your code, I detected a potential security issue related to the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) that your application uses. While you have not done anything wrong specifically in your code, the inherent traits of the UDP protocol itself might cause some security concerns.

Here is the identified security defect in more detail:

**Unsecured UDP Sockets (Line 97):** UDP is a stateless protocol and does not provide any secure mechanisms for message delivery. This makes it susceptible to various security attacks such as IP spoofing, data manipulation, and more. In addition, you're broadcasting sensitive information through datagram, which is risky because it can be accessible by any device connected to the broadcast network. 

Solution:

A better approach would be to use a more secure protocol such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or even UDP with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) if you require the speed and efficiency of UDP. Ensure that sensitive data is always encrypted before transfer, regardless of the protocol used.  

Also, reconsider the safety of broadcasting information, especially if it is sensitive. If broadcasting is necessary, put additional checks into place, e.g., checking the identity of the receiving client. Alternatively, a direct communication channel could be established with known clients to avoid broadcasting sensitives informations to all connected devices.
