The code you have shared is majorly part of the QPixmapCache class from the QtGui module of the Qt Toolkit. It handles the caching mechanism for pixmaps.

After going through the code, I want to point out that there seem to be no immediately apparent security defects. The code is well-structured and uses standard Qt constructs and design patterns.

However, there is a multithreading aspect (Refer to lines 107-111 and 88-89) to consider which could potentially be a source of issues if not properly handled or if used in a context not aware of this limitation. The QPixmapCache class is recommended to be used only from the application's main thread, and access from other threads will be ignored and return failure. 

While this is not a security defect per se, it can potentially lead to unexpected behaviour, logic flaws, crashes or data loss if the application using this code is not properly synchronized. Specifically, if QPixmapCache objects are accessed or modified simultaneously by different threads, it may result in undefined behaviour. Therefore, appropriate synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, locks, condition variables) or design patterns (message passing) must be used to ensure thread safety.

Please note that proper code function also relies on correct usage, secure handling of external data and overall secure coding techniques not apparent from this single file itself. Hence, while it appears that there is no security defect in this presented code, it is still crucial to apply secure coding practices in the other parts of the application. 

For a more thorough analysis and to be absolutely certain, it's recommended the entire application is analyzed or audited to ensure proper usage, handling, and storage of sensitive data. 

For now, it can be stated that '''No security defects are detected in the code'''.
