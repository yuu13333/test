The code below does not seem to incorporate any explicit security defects. The script is predominantly focused on the configuration of the project's build and run process with the use of the Emrun tool from the Emscripten SDK. 

Remember, however, that the absence of obvious security issues does not imply that the code is completely secure. Actual safety evaluations often necessitate a deeper understanding of the entire codebase, not just isolated snippets of code. 

That being said, no security defects are detected in this particular code segment. Ensure to employ secure coding practices and make your application code robust against potential vulnerabilities while you continue to build out this project.
