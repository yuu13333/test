I have reviewed the provided code and didn't find any security defects. The memory management and allocations are handled well, and the handling of function pointers in Interface struct should be safe as well, provided calls to the functions provided by 'Interface' are made with valid data and parameters.

Though I did not find any security defects, it's essential to keep in mind that this is just one part of an application. Being part of a larger system, if the mechanisms this code is meant to interact with aren't built or used securely, security issues may still arise.

Therefore, "No security defects are detected in the code".
