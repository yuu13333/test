Based on the provided code, there is a security defect related to insecure permissions setting on line numbers 57-68. 

This defect can be categorized under CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource. In these lines, the permissions for all the files in the Android SDK tools directory are being iterated over. If the file name does not contain a dot ('.'), execute permissions are given for the owner of the file.

This is potentially dangerous as it may unintentionally give permissions to executables that should not have them, that can be exploited by an attacker for unauthorized execution of code. 

Solution: 

You should assign these sensitive permissions more carefully to prevent potential security problems. Consider only giving execute permissions to trusted executables or scripts. If you know the names of the files that should be executable, only add the permission to those. 

The revised code could look like this:

```cpp
57 static void setSdkFilesExecPermission(const QString &sdkExtractPath)
58 {
59     QStringList trustedExecs = {"trusted1", "trusted2", "trusted3"};
60     QDirIterator it(sdkExtractPath + QDir::separator() + "tools", QStringList() << "*",
61                     QDir::Files, QDirIterator::Subdirectories);
62     while (it.hasNext()) {
63         QFile file(it.next());
64         if (trustedExecs.contains(file.fileName())) {
65             QFlags<QFileDevice::Permission> currentPermissions
66              = file.permissions();
67             file.setPermissions(currentPermissions | QFileDevice::ExeOwner);
68         }
69     }
70 }
```
In this snippet, only the files with names 'trusted1', 'trusted2', and 'trusted3' would be given execute permissions. Adjust the 'trustedExecs' list to fit your needs.
