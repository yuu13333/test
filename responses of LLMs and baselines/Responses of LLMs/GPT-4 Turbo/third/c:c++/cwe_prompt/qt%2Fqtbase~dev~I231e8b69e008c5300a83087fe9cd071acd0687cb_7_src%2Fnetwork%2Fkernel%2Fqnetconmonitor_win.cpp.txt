After carefully reviewing the entire codebase using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as the reference standard, I found no security defects in the code.

It's worth noting, however, that a security review conducted by a human may not catch every possible issue, and automated tools may be able to find vulnerabilities that a manual review cannot. However, based on the code you provided me and considering the specifications of CWE, 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
