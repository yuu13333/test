In the provided code, I found a potential security defect regarding the use of lambda function in `QTimer::singleShot()` on line 182. In this line, a lambda function is used which captures all outer variables by reference, including `this`, and uses the reference inside the lambda.

CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release.

The potential issue is that `this` might have been deleted from memory when the QTimer calls the lambda function. This can lead to a use-after-free error, which is a serious vulnerability as it could lead to arbitrary code execution, exposure of sensitive information, or crashing the program.

We can resolve this issue by using a QPointer inside the capture list of the Lambda function to safely capture the `this` pointer. If `this` has been deleted by the time the lambda function is called, the QPointer would be nullptr and we would avoid accessing freed memory. So, the code part should be modified as follows:

```cpp
QPointer<SerialControl> safeThis(this);
QTimer::singleShot(Constants::RESET_DELAY, [safeThis]{
  if(safeThis)
    safeThis->m_serialPort->setDataTerminalReady(safeThis->m_initialDtrState);
});
```

Please, check the rest of the code carefully to ensure that no similar issues or other vulnerabilities exist.
