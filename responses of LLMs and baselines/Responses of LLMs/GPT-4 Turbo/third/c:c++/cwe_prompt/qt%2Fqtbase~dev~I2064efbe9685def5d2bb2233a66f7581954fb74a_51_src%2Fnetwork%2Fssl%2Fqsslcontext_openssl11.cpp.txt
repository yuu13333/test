Based on the provided code, there are a few potential security defects that can be identified:

1) Use of a Potentially Dangerous Function (CWE-676): On line 75, the method `goto init_context` is used. The use of `goto` in C++ programming is generally discouraged as it can lead to poorly structured and hard-to-read code, increasing the possibility of errors or security vulnerabilities.

2) Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345): On line 218, 220, and 225, SSL peer verification and verification depth are set. However, there appears to be no handling for cases where the peer verification fails or is tampered with, thus providing a potential entry point for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

3) Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Log File (CWE-532): Throughout the code, error handling involves generating strings containing details about the errors that occurred, e.g. lines 95, 123, 159, 166, 190, 199, and 235. This could potentially include sensitive information that can be exploited if log files are not properly protected.

4) Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798): On line 252, the function `q_SSL_CTX_use_psk_identity_hint` suggests to use a pre-shared key (PSK). If this is hardcoded anywhere, it presents a severe security risk.

Solutions:

1) Replace the usage of `goto` by a more suitable control structure, like a `do-while` loop to refactor the part of code with `goto`.

2) Make sure that if the verification fails, an exception is thrown or the connection is refused. Implement proper error handling mechanisms.

3) Ensure only pertinent, non-sensitive data is included in log entries, and make use of secure logging practices to protect any sensitive data.

4) Rather than hard coding credentials, consider using secure, externalized configuration files, environment variables or secure Vault solutions to provide this information appropriately.
