After reviewing the code based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) reference standard, there are no discernible security defects in the given code. The code snippet seems to be related to the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy for a domain and does not contain any insecure operations, improper input validation, insecure communication, poor error handling or any other standard violation that would lead to a security risk.

Thus, 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
