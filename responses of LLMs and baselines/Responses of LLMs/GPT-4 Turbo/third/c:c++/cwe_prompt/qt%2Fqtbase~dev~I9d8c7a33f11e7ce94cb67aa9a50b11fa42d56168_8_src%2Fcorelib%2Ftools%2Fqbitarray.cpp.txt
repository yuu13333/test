Based on the provided code, the following potential security defects have been detected, in accordance to The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list of software security weaknesses:

1. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) at line 150:
The assertion that controls the input size is not efficient for controlling the size of the input data. If the data is maliciously crafted, it could bypass this assertion. A better error handling mechanism would be to return an error code and not just silently fail.

Solution: Implement a proper input validation and sanitization strategy. Throw an appropriate exception if the size is negative, or handle the error via an error code, or using boolean return type, explicitly marking the operation as failed.

2. CWE-676 (Use of Potentially Dangerous Function) at line 155:
The use of `memset` function can be dangerous if not used carefully as it can lead to issues related with buffer overflow. 

Solution: Interchange `memset` with safer function alternatives such as `std::fill`. 

Please revise the mentioned lines of code and apply necessary adjustments.
