After thoroughly inspecting the code, I didn't find any security defects which could be categorized using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standard. So, I would state: 'No security defects are detected in the code'. However, it's worth to mention that you should always keep your tools and libraries up to date to ensure security.
