The code you provided seems to be missing the 'g' flag at the end of some of the regular expressions. 

For example, the line 724 might not work correctly because it specifies a regular expression (^\\w+ \\w+$) with the QRegularExpression::MultilineOption set, but it does not include 'g' (global match) at the end of the regular expression.

A possible fix could be to add 'g' at the end of the regular expression to find all matches in the input, not just the first one, like this:

^\\w+ \\w+$g

Please make sure to check the other lines of code that specify regular expressions and missing the 'g' flag as well.

Also, based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards, this could potentially be a 'Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) - CWE-400'. Although it's important to note that the given code doesn't contain any user inputs in a Regex directly but ReDos can occur whenever a regular expression has pathological behavior. 

Solution: Avoid using the regular expressions that can result in extreme situations, i.e. exponential or factorial time complexity, on your code. Use tools that helps with creating safe regular expressions or use libraries
