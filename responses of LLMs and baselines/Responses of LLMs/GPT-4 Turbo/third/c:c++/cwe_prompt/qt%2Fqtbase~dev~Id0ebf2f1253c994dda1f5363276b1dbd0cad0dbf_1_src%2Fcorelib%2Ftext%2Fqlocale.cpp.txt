This page contains information about the QLocale class, which is used in Qt to handle localization of numbers, dates, times, and strings. It provides a way to work with various internationalization aspects, such as:
- Representing and formatting dates, times, and numbers according to the localeâ€™s conventions.
- Accessing currency symbols, collation order, text direction, and language and country names.

The class has many functions for converting between localized and C-locale strings and for formatting and parsing numbers and dates. It also includes functions for accessing specific locale information, such as currency symbols, native language names, and measurement systems.

The QLocale class can be created for specific languages, scripts, and countries, using ISO language and country codes, or it can be initialized to the system's locale settings.

QLocale also provides static functions for accessing a list of valid locales, system collation settings, and other localization-related utilities.

The QLocale class is part of the QtCore module in the Qt framework and includes extensive support for turning data into human-readable localized formats and vice versa. It is crucial for applications that require localization or internationalization.

For more technical details and examples on how to use QLocale, please refer to the Qt documentation.
