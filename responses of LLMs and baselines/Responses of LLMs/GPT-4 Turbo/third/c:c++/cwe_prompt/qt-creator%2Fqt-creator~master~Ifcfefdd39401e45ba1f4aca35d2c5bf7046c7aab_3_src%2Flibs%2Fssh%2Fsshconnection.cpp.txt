Upon analyzing the source code provided for potential security weaknesses, one potential flaw stood out. This flaw aligns with CWE-200: Information Exposure.

Code Lines: 130-134
These lines show a lack of proper secrecy management, potentially exposing key information during the SSH connection process. Particularly, line 132 exposes the SSH private key file via the "-i" option if a specific key authentication type is selected. An implication of this flaw could be a potential information leak, as the private key is a critical security entity and its exposure to any third-party program or service can lead to the compromise of the SSH connection.

Proposed Solutions:
Consider minimizing the exposure of the SSH private key details during the authentication process. This could potentially be achieved through the use of secure environments, containers, and encapsulation methods that prevent third-party services or other programs from gaining access to the private key.

Please also note that a code review cannot accurately and completely eliminate all potential security issues. To further understand the code's security posture, consider using supplementary measures such as automated security tools, running the software in a controlled and monitored environment, and frequently updating libraries and dependencies to avoid using versions that contain known vulnerabilities.
