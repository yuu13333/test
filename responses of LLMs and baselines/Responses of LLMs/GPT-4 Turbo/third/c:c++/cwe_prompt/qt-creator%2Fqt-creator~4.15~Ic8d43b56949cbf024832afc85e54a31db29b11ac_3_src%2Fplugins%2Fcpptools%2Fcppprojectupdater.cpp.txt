Given the shared code, there are no explicit or direct security defects based on the provided information and without broader context such as the implementation details of the functions called within this code. It primarily deals with project updates within a development environment, including updating project information and handling toolchain removal. 

However, without knowledge of certain implementations (e.g., `CppModelManager::instance()->updateProjectInfo`, `Utils::runAsync`, the `ProjectInfoGenerator` class, and how project information and tool chains are managed), it's challenging to definitively identify security defects such as those related to improper input handling, race conditions, or unauthorized access to resources (files, network). These are common areas of concern that could lead to vulnerabilities if not properly addressed, but they are not explicitly present in the abstracted code provided.

To further improve any assessment of security-related defects, it would be necessary to:

1. Analyze the implementations of external calls to assess how they handle user input and if there are any buffer overflow risks, incorrect permission assignments, or insecure interaction between components (CWE-20, CWE-264).

2. Review how instances are managed to ensure there are no potential memory leaks or issues related to the improper release of resources (CWE-404, CWE-772).

3. Ensure that there is proper error handling and logging to avoid information disclosure and misuse of the system (CWE-209, CWE-388).

In conclusion, based on the snippet provided and without further context or the ability to analyze related components and their implementations, no specific CWE-standard security defects are detected. It would be prudent to perform a more in-depth review focusing on specific security-sensitive areas mentioned above if applicable to the broader codebase or application being developed.
