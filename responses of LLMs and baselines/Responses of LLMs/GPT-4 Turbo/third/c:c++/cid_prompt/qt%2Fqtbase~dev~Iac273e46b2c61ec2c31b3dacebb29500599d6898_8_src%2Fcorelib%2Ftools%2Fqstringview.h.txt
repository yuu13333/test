After careful analysis, I've found a potential security defect in terms of CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation).

The defect is located in the following lines:

```cpp
90     Q_DECL_RELAXED_CONSTEXPR size_t length(const Char *str) Q_DECL_NOTHROW
91     {
92         size_t result = 0;
93         if (str) {
94             while (!str--)
95                 ++result;
96         }
97         return result;
98     }
```

This code attempts to calculate the length of a string. However, the logic inside the while loop seems incorrect. It negates `str` with `!str--`, which means it will continue incrementing `result` until it encounters a falsy value (i.e., a null character or 0). As `str` is being decremented ( due to `str--`), if it does not reach 0, this could potentially lead to an infinite loop or accessing invalid memory.

The corrected function could look like this:

```cpp
90     Q_DECL_RELAXED_CONSTEXPR size_t length(const Char *str) Q_DECL_NOTHROW
91     {
92         size_t result = 0;
93         if (str)
94         {
95             while (*str++)
96                 ++result;
97         }
98         return result;
99     }
```
In the revised version, `str` is dereferenced then incremented, meaning it counts characters until it reaches a null character. This should safely calculate the length of the string. 

No other CWE types were detected in the code provided.
