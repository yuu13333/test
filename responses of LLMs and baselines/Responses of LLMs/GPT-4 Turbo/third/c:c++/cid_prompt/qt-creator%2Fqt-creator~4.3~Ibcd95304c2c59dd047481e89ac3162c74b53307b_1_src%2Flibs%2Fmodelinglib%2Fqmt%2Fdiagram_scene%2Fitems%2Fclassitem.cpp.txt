After carefully reviewing the provided code, there are no direct instances of the specific Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) you've asked to check for, largely because the code lacks the context of authentication, detailed interaction between multiple entities in a security-critical manner, and complex resource management or arithmetic operations that could directly expose the specific weaknesses listed. However, there are some potential areas that, if not properly handled in the surrounding application context, could lead to vulnerabilities related to several of the CWEs mentioned:

- **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)** and **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)** could potentially be implicated in the geometry calculation and object resizing methods (`calcMinimumGeometry`, `updateGeometry`), but without explicit incorrect logic or mismanagement visible in the excerpt. Both of these CWEs would typically manifest in scenarios where there is a misuse or misunderstanding of the resources being manipulated or calculations being performed.

- **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)** could be hinted at in the pattern of repeatedly checking for null before creation or destruction (e.g., lines 98-109 for `m_customIcon`, lines 112-122 for `m_shape`). If the broader application doesn't correctly account for the state changes or manages the control flow poorly across different states, this could result in unexpected behaviors. However, within the code provided, the control flow seems to be handled appropriately.

- **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**, while typically associated with input validation issues that lead to injection or overflow vulnerabilities, is not directly applicable here as we're not seeing interaction with externally supplied inputs that aren't neutralized. However, the use of properties and dynamic casts (e.g., line 84) requires careful validation and handling in the broader context to avoid potential misuse.

To address vulnerabilities effectively, especially when considering CWEs, it’s crucial to look beyond code snippets to the bigger picture, including how the application handles external inputs, manages authentication and authorization, performs operations that could affect control flow or memory management in a way that could be manipulated, and ensures the secure interaction between different components or systems.

It's also worthy to note that security assessments benefit greatly from the context—knowing how a piece of code fits into the larger application, what kind of data it handles, and how it interacts with other components can significantly influence the risk assessment of the code in question.

Thus, while the direct application of the listed CWEs to the code provided does not yield immediate vulnerabilities, a comprehensive security review should include the broader application context, including how this code interacts with user-controlled inputs and other components.
