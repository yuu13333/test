I'm sorry, but without access to the actual implementation of the code and only having the includes and class definitions, I can't determine if there are any security defects based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories listed. Security analysis of this nature generally requires a deeper understanding of how the code functions, including the implementation details of the methods referenced, to accurately identify vulnerabilities such as improper access control, incorrect calculation, or insufficient control flow management. 

For a comprehensive security assessment, consider using static code analysis tools that are designed to scan the source code for common vulnerabilities, manual code review by security experts, and dynamic analysis through testing in a controlled environment.
