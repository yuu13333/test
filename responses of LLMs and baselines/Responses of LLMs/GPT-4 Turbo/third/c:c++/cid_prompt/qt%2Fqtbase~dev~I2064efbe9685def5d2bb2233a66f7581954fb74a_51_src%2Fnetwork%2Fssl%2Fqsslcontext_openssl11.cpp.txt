The primary issue in the provided code is CWE-435: Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities on lines [176-188]. The code in these lines is using `EVP_PKEY_set1_*` functions, which do not take ownership of the keys, with the rationale that `QSslKey` already has ownership. 

However, in line [189], the function `q_SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey` is used, which signs its argument, `sslContext->pkey`. If multiple objects/applications are referencing the same private key, this part might compromise the security of the entire system, as the signing of keys is not controlled or limited.

A solution for this issue is ensuring exclusive ownership of the private key using strong access control policies. Besides, be sure to avoid signing the key through external methods or libraries randomly. Instead, implement a secure internal process to manage keys signing.

For the rest of the code, no other security defects can be detected for the specified CWEs.
