Upon reviewing the provided code, it appears that there are no glaring security defects related to the CWE categories you asked to consider. Here's a breakdown with respect to the relevant CWEs:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: No instances of improper access control are observable. The code mainly deals with mathematical operations and data structure manipulation without explicit access control mechanisms, which is typical for such low-level code.
   
2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: The code does not appear to involve interactions between multiple entities in a way that could lead to improper interactions. Its scope is limited to operations on QPoint and QPointF objects.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: Resource management is not directly addressed within this code snippet, as it deals primarily with simple data structure operations without managing resources such as memory or file handles directly.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: All mathematical calculations appear standard and correct within the context of the QPoint and QPointF operations. Each operation is well-defined for these types.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: The operations are simple mathematical manipulations without complex control flow that could lead to insufficient control flow management issues.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: There are no explicit protection mechanisms in place, as the code does not deal with access control or sensitive operations requiring such mechanisms.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: The `==` and `!=` operators for QPoint and QPointF are implemented correctly, taking into account the nature of floating-point comparison for QPointF.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: Although there's an assert (`Q_ASSERT(divisor > 0 || divisor < 0);`) statement in function `operator/=(qreal divisor)`, it's used as expected to ensure the divisor is not zero before performing division. This is a proper use of assertion to prevent division by zero errors.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: This category does not seem applicable as the code does not process external inputs or data that needs neutralization (for example, input validation or sanitization).

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The provided code adheres to the expected coding standards for Qt applications, including the use of conventions for naming, noexcept specifications, and constexpr usage.

No security defects are detected in the code based on the provided CWE categories.
