After reviewing the provided code, I noticed a security issue concerning CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):

1. This issue can be found in the functions `generateCookieCallback()` and `verifyCookieCallback()`. These two functions use a static `CookieSecret` structure that is created once and shared. The internally stored `QByteArray key` data member of `CookieSecret` is crucial for a correct message authentication code (MAC). Its lifetime is completely controlled by the system, and there is no mechanism in place to update or regenerate it in case of a potential leak. This could lead to potential security risks where the key could potentially be exposed.

Suggested solution: Instead of using a static, system managed secret key, dynamically generate and manage your secret keys. The key should ideally have an expiration, and a new one should be generated after the old one has been invalidated. The sensitive data should be kept in volatile memory areas and should be wiped out correctly.

Please note that the other CWE cases mentioned were not clearly visible in the code. While there are several unimplemented functions and possible math handling issues, they would not have a substantial impact until further implemented.
