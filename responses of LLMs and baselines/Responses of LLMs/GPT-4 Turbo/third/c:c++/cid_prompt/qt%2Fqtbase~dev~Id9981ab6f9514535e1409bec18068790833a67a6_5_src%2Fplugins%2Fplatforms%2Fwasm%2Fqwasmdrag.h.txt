Based on the provided code snippet alone, specific security defects related to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list you've provided cannot be detected directly. This snippet primarily illustrates class declaration and includes directives with no implementation details that could explicitly indicate the mentioned CWE issues like improper access control, incorrect calculation, or improper handling of exceptional conditions. 

Security analysis to identify defects like CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) or others from the list typically requires insight into how resources are accessed, manipulated, and controlled throughout the codebase, including the actual implementation logic of methods like `init()`, `drop()`, and `move()` which are not provided in the snippet.

For a comprehensive security review, it's essential to audit the implementation details of the class methods, how the class interacts with other components, and adherence to secure coding practices throughout the codebase. Without these details, stating specific security defects linked to the mentioned CWE categories in this code is not feasible.

In absence of implementation detail:
- Ensure that methods such as `init()`, `drop()`, and `move()` properly manage access control, especially when interacting with system resources or sensitive information (CWE-284).
- Verify that the interaction between this drag component and other entities within the system is correctly managed, particularly regarding how data is exchanged or manipulated (CWE-435).
- Review the lifetime management of the resources like `QWasmScreen *wasmScreen` and `QMimeData *mimeData` to prevent leaks or unauthorized access (CWE-664).
- Make sure all calculations, especially those that might affect resource management or security decisions, are correctly implemented (CWE-682).
- Inspect the flow control in the methods to ensure that it's sufficient and cannot be easily bypassed or misused (CWE-691).
- Confirm that all necessary protection mechanisms are in place and correctly functioning to secure the drag-and-drop operations (CWE-693).
- Perform thorough comparisons and validations throughout the class to prevent errors that could be exploited (CWE-697).
- Ensure exceptional conditions, especially those that could lead to security vulnerabilities, are properly checked and handled (CWE-703).
- Review the coding standards adherence to ensure that the code is maintainable, and security practices are consistently applied (CWE-710).

In conclusion, without visibility into how the class interacts with the rest of the system and handles its resources throughout its lifetime, pinpointing specific CWE defects from the provided list in the code snippet is not possible. A detailed audit, considering the points above, is recommended for a comprehensive security assessment.
