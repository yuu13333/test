While there is no direct exploitation of sensitive data, insecure direct object reference, or improper access control in the provided code, certain best practices could further improve the code quality. These include more detailed inline comments describing the purpose and functionality of classes and functions, additional error handling and exception throwing for unexpected outcomes (in line with CWE-703), and ensuring that any function inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent unintended behavior (relating to CWE-707 and CWE-710). 

In addition, ensure to keep the code and its corresponding dependencies up to date to prevent potential unpatched vulnerabilities.
