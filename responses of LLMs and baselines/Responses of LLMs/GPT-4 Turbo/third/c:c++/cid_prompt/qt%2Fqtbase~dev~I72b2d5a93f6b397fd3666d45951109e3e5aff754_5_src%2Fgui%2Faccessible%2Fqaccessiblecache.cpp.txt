Analyzing the code, I've found two potential security defects:

1. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
There is no assurance that the custom deletion of pointers in the `deleteInterface()` function will indeed set pointers to null. In C++, deleting a pointer does not set it to null, therefore, you have a potential dangling pointer that could lead to undefined behavior.

    Solution: As a safety measure, it's better to set pointers to nullptr after deleting them.

    The issue is at the following lines of code:

    * Line 201: `delete iface;`

2. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): 
The example code doesn't handle the situation where memory allocation fails when creating a new `QAccessibleCache` object. In such a case, the program can crash after attempting to dereference a null pointer.

    Solution: Consider using a smart pointer in this scenario. Theyâ€™re designed to handle this situation gracefully.

    The issue is at the following lines of code:

    * Line 73: `accessibleCache = new QAccessibleCache;`

Please note that the above are best practices to prevent undefined behavior and to write robust code. The current code, in a common environment, might not necessarily cause a crash. Nonetheless, it's good to consider these scenarios for a more defensive programming approach.
