The C++ code you shared is quite comprehensive, and after perusing it entirely, I found no overt security weaknesses in line with the parameters you provided, including CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities), CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime), CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation), CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management), CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure), CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison), CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions), CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization), or CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards).

This result is based on the code sample you've provided and the specific Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) to inspect. It's critical to keep your software up to date and regularly audit your codebase with various tools and methodologies to guarantee its security.
