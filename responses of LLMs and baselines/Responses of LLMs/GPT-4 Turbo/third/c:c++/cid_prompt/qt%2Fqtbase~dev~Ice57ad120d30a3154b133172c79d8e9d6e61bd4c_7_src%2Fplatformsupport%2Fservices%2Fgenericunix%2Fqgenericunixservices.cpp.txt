I have reviewed the provided source code and I am not able to pick out any noticeable security defects with regards to the following types:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)
7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)
8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
10.CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)

However, please note that the complete validation of the code against all mentioned defects requires a deep security and operational context which includes aspects such as the behavior of linked resources, the environment in which the code is running, and other external variables. It is highly recommended to perform additional extensive security checks preferably with static or dynamic analysis tools and vulnerability scanners, considering all operational context.

It's important to mention that the quality of the code and adherence to coding standards could be improved. For instance, magic strings or numbers were used directly in the code like 'google-chrome', 'firefox', etc. (line 126), that may be extracted as constants at the beginning of the code.

For extensive security checks, you might want to consider consulting with a security expert or performing security testing procedures in your software development cycle.
