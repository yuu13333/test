I have reviewed the code you provided and found no security defects. The class pattern, memory management, and mechanisms appear to be implemented properly. The use of smart pointers (QScopedPointer) in the code indicates good memory management practices to avoid memory leaks and dangling pointers. Also, the copy constructor and the assignment operator are explicitly disabled using Q_DISABLE_COPY macro which helps to prevent shallow copying and potential problems associated therewith.

Therefore, I can confidently state "No security defects are detected in the code."
