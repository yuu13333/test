Based on the provided code snippet and focusing on the specified Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), there doesn't appear to be direct evidence of security defects related to the listed CWE categories. The code primarily consists of configurations and definitions without explicit operations on resources, access control definitions, or dynamic exception handling that would typically be analyzed for these kinds of security defects. 

It's crucial to note that security analysis of configuration parameters and their implications requires deep understanding of the deployment environment, the network topology, and how these configurations interact with other system components. Incorrect configurations can lead to security issues, but identifying these requires contextual information beyond the code itself. 

For a thorough security audit, consider also evaluating the use of these configurations in the broader system, potential misconfigurations, and ensuring that the system's design adheres to the principle of least privilege, effective exception handling, and correct implementation of access controls.
