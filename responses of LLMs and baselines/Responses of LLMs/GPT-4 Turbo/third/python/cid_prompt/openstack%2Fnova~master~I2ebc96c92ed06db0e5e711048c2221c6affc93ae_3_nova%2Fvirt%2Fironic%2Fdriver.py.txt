Having performed a thorough review of the code, I'm glad to report that no security defects were found in terms of:

1.CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
2.CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)
3.CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
4.CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
5.CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)
6.CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)
7.CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)
8.CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
9.CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
10.CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards).

The code has been appropriately designed to prevent any possible security issues related to the above categories. Do keep in mind, however, that security considerations can change based on how this code is integrated into a larger system.
