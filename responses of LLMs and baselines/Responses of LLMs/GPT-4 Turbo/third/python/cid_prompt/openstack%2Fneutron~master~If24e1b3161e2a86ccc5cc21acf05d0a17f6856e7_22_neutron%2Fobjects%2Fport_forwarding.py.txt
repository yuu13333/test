After analyzing your given code, I found two potential security defects related to CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) and CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization).

1. CWE-664: It looks like the resource (floating ip object) is not managed properly throughout its lifetime. Once defined in the `_get_fip_obj()` method (line 77), the FIP_OBJ instance is only updated when it is initially `None` (line 78). However, if the `floatingip_id` changes at any point after the first instantiation, the existing FIP_OBJ will still be used, and won't be updated to correspond with the `floatingip_id`. This could potentially lead to a situation where the FIP_OBJ does not align with the `floatingip_id`. This issue affects line 77-81.

   To resolve this issue, instead of reusing FIP_OBJ, you should fetch the floating ip object directly from the database every time when necessary.

2. CWE-707: Other potential issue is related to the `modify_fields_to_db()` method at line 107-115, where a socket string is created using the `internal_ip_address` and `internal_port`. It directly uses the `internal_ip_address` and `internal_port` without validating or sanitizing the data which may cause injection issue if a malicious input is provided.

   To solve this issue, before concatenating into a socket string, both the`internal_ip_address` and `internal_port` should be validate and sanitized. For example, ensure that `internal_ip_address` is a valid IP address, and `internal_port` is a valid port number within valid range. This will help to avoid potential misuse of your application.

I encourage you to conduct more tests or use more advanced static analysis tools to further validate these potential vulnerabilities, as there might be cases not covered in this review.
