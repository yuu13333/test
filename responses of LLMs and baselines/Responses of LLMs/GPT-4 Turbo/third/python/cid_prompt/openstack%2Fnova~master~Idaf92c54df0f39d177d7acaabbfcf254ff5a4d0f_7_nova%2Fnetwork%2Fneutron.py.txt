The code seems to respect secure operating principles such as proper exception handling, logging, error control flow management, consistent coding standards and there is no direct evidence of any Improper control of resource, incorrect calculations, improper comparison, incorrect check or handling of exceptional conditions, improper neutralization, or improper adherence to coding standards. 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
