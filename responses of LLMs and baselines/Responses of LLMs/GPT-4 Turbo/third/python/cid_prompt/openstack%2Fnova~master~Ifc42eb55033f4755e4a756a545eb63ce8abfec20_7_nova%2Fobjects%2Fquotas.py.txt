After reviewing the provided code, I didn't detect any security defects directly related to the specified Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). However, it's important to note that a thorough security assessment often requires a deeper understanding of the application's overall architecture, the specific deployment environment, and additional context that might not be present in the code snippet alone.

To ensure the security of this code:

- **Access Control (CWE-284)**: Verify that access control measures are appropriately enforced at all layers of the application, not just within the function logic. This can include database permissions, API access controls, and user authentication mechanisms. The code itself does a check on lines 27-35 to differentiate between admin and non-admin users, but ensuring that these controls are adequately enforced in all relevant parts of the application is crucial.

- **Proper Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-703)**: The exception handling (`try-except` blocks) used, for example in lines 192-196 and 315-320, appears to be proper, but ensuring comprehensive exception handling throughout is important to avoid unexpected behavior or information disclosure.

- **Resource Control (CWE-664)** and **Control Flow Management (CWE-691)**: While the code manages database transactions and utilizes the `context_manager` for database operations, ensuring that these mechanisms correctly handle all resource lifetimes and control flows within the application's context is important.

If integrating this code into a larger project, consider conducting a full security review that includes:
- Static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities automatically.
- Manual code review by security professionals.
- Penetration testing to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
- Reviewing database permissions and configurations for adherence to the principle of least privilege.

Remember, security is an ongoing process and should be revisited regularly as part of the development lifecycle.
