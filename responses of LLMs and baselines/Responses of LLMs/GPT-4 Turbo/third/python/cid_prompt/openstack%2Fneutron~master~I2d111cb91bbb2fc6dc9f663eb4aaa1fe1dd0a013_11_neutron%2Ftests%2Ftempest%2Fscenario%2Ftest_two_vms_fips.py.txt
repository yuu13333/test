By analyzing the given code, I found some potential security defects:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): In line 66 where the method `create_vms()` creates multiple servers and shares the same key amongst them, it could possibly permit unauthorized actors access to unintended servers. To rectify this, each server should have its own distinct key.

2. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): The function `create_vms()` does not sanitize the input arguments 'hyper' and 'avail_zone'. If the availability zone or hypervisor input is controlled by the user or obtained from an untrusted source, it can lead to improper neutralization. An input sanitation needs to be performed before using 'hyper' and 'avail_zone' in line 69.
  
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime): The encapsulation of critical resources such as keypairs and security groups is not controlled properly as evident from lines 38 and 40. You should ensure revocation of resources that are no longer in use to prevent any unwanted usage or vulnerabilities. A mechanism to check and revoke such entities should be implemented.

4. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): It is unable to handle failed connections or exceptions when attempting to use SSH to connect to the servers in line 91. When a failure happens it goes unnoticed and hence the code executes further potentially leading to undefined states and errors. You need to implement a way to handle exceptions during SSH connections, such as handling the respective exceptions and providing an error message to the user, or implementing a retry functionality.

The remaining CWE security defect types are not present in the given code.
