Based on the given code, I don't detect any specific security defects in terms of the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types you listed. The code includes notable practices, such as exception handling (lines 38, 87), not making inaccurate computations, and using debug logs instead of exposing potential system-sensitive information by using error logs excessively.

It's important to stress, though, that the absence of explicit defects doesn't necessarily mean the code is entirely secure. Other best practices, not necessarily linked to the CWE list, such as regular code inspections, practicing least privilege principle, input validation, secure configuration, and validation of the software's security boundaries can significantly improve the code's security. 

Also, security doesn't depend on code alone but involves other aspects like secure environments, secure communication, secure storage, and secure infrastructure among others. So, comprehensive security assessments and tests are always recommended.
