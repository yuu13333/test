I'm unable to execute or directly analyze code in a way that would identify specific security defects as requested. However, I can offer general advice on where and how these Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) might manifest in a typical project similar to what you've described. Here's how you can think about the potential vulnerabilities mapped to the CWEs you're interested in:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** Ensure that any operations, APIs, or functionalities within your code that require certain permissions are properly guarded. This usually involves checking user roles or permissions before executing a sensitive operation.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):** This can occur if your code has components that interact in unexpected ways potentially allowing an attacker to exploit these interactions. Regularly reviewing the interaction flow and applying least privilege can mitigate this.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):** This involves ensuring that resources are correctly initialized, used, and destroyed. One common example is not releasing database connections or file handles after use.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):** It's important to review all mathematical calculations, especially those affecting security decisions or business logic to ensure they're correctly implemented.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):** This includes making sure your application's control flow is predictable and not influenced by external, untrusted inputs. Validating and sanitizing inputs is critical here.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):** Ensure that any security mechanism you implement (e.g., authentication, authorization, data encryption) is correctly working and cannot be bypassed.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):** Beware of vulnerabilities stemming from incorrect comparisons, such as string comparison vulnerabilities. Always use secure and recommended methods for comparing sensitive data.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** Proper error handling is key. Make sure that your application can handle errors in a way that doesn't expose sensitive information or leads to further vulnerabilities.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):** Typically refers to issues like improper neutralization of special elements in output (Cross-Site Scripting) or queries (SQL Injection). Always sanitize inputs and neutralize outputs.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):** Follow secure coding standards and guidelines for your development stack. Many vulnerabilities stem from deviating from these practices.

It's critical to regularly audit your code for these vulnerabilities, either through manual code review, automated tools, or, ideally, both. Don't forget to keep dependencies up to date and adopt a security-focused development lifecycle.
