There seems to be an instance of CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) in this code. The global `CELL_CACHE` dictionary in line 40 is used as a cache, however it is never cleared, this could be a memory leak waiting to happen especially in long running processes. While comments around lines 37-39 suggest this is a known issue and give some guidance on when the cache should be cleared, at present the cache simply grows indefinitely.

As a solution, you can establish a mechanism to periodically clear the `CELL_CACHE` under specified conditions, or when it reaches a certain size. A way to implement this would be:
1. Set a maximum size for the `CELL_CACHE`.
2. When a new entry is added and the cache is at maximum size, remove the oldest or least recently used entry.

This issue starts from line 40 and affects the `set_target_cell` and `target_cell` functions where this cache is used i.e. from lines 365-419.
Some methods to mitigate this problem could be:
- Use a structure with automatic eviction policy based on LRU or TTL such as `cachetools.LRUCache` or `cachetools.TTLCache`.
- If thread safety is a concern, consider using `cachetools`'s synchronized wrappers.

The code, as a result, remains vulnerable until a suitable caching strategy is implemented or the TODO near line 37 is addressed.
