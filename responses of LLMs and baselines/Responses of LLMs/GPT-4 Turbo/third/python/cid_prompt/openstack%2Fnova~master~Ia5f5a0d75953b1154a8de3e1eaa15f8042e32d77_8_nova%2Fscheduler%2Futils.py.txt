Apologies, but reviewing your provided code, I couldn't identify any explicit security defects related to the categories you specified (CWE-284, CWE-435, CWE-664, CWE-682, CWE-691, CWE-693, CWE-697, CWE-703, CWE-707, CWE-710). The code seems to handle exceptions carefully and doesn't indicate a clear violation of secure coding practices.

However, please bear in mind 100% security can never be assured just by analysing the code snippet shared. Other aspects like the server it's running on, the dependencies it's built with, how the application as a whole is set up etc. also play a significant role in the security of an application. 

I would recommend using automated tooling for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) or employing a security-focused code review for a deeper analysis if you haven't done so already.
