After reviewing the provided code, I have detected a potential security defect in line 136-145. It falls under CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities).

The specific issue is related to the SSL handshake procedure. The use of `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` in line 144 limits the client to a particular version of the TLS protocol. This might prevent the client from negotiating a higher version of TLS if the server supports it, thereby weakening the security level of the connection.

This issue can be mitigated by allowing the highest protocol version supported by the client and server for their communication. To fix this problem, `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` in line 144 should be replaced with `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS`. This enables the client and server to select the highest mutually supported protocol.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
try:
    wrapped_sock = ssl.wrap_socket(
        compute_sock,
        keyfile=client_key,
        certfile=client_cert,
        server_side=False,
        cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_REQUIRED,
        ca_certs=CONF.vnc.vencrypt_ca_certs,
        ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS)
```

By making this change, we can mitigate potential SSL/TLS protocol downgrade attacks and strengthen the security of the SSL/TLS protocol negotiation process.

Besides this observation, no other security defects from the specified list were detected in the provided code.
