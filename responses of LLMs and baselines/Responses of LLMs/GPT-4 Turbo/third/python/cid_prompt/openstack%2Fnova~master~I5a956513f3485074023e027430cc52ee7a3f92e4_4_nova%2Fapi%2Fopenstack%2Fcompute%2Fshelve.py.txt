After reviewing the code provided, no explicit security defects related to the specified CWEs are detected in the code segments shown here. The code seems to manage exceptional conditions appropriately by catching various instance-related exceptions (lines 48-49, 50-51, 67-68, 69-70, 96-97, 98-99) and responding with the correct HTTP error codes.

It's important to mention that the actual security of the code cannot be fully determined without deeper context such as the implementation of the methods called here (like `self.compute_api.shelve`, `self.compute_api.shelve_offload`, and `self.compute_api.unshelve`), the permissions model used by `context.can()` (which checks permissions), and other related system components and their interaction with this code. A comprehensive security review would need access to these details and may involve dynamic analysis, thorough static code analysis, and checking configurations of the environment where the code is running.

Also, it is worth noting that secure code practices also include secure configuration, not just the function implementations. For example, how the compute API is authenticated and how errors are logged would be important contexts to assess security.

To conclude, based on the limited scope provided here, 'No security defects are detected in the code'. However, for a conclusive review, a full inspection of the associated codebase and operational environment would be essential.
