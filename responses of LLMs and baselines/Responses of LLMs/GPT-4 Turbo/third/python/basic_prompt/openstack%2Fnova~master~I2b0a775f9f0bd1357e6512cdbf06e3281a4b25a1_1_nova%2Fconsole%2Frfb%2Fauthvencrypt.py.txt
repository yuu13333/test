The main security concern can be seen on line 143-144 where the SSL version PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2 is used. While this version of SSL is considered strong, it may now be considered outdated in 2024. As cybersecurity progresses, new SSL/TLS versions usually fix security issues found in older versions. In some regions or industries, relying on outdated SSL/TLS versions can also lead to non-compliance with data protection rules.

To fix the issue, update to the latest stable TLS version. For example, SSLv3 fix required modifying the code to use the latest stable version at the time like so:

```python
ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS
```
Before implementing the change, make sure to check other components of the infrastructure used to ensure they can handle the updated SSL/TLS version. If not, those components should also be updated.

It's also necessary to frequently review the code to ensure that the SSL/TLS version is still the latest, supported, and secure one.
