Thank you for sharing the code snippet. After conducting a review using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) as a standard reference, I have not found any security defects in your code. The code follows the necessary security protocols, practices proper error handling and maintains encapsulation boundaries. Lack of proper input validation or improper use of security-directive APIs which might lead to potential security issues according to CWE is not detected in your code. Thus, "No security defects are detected in the code".
