Analyzing the provided code snippet against the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards reveals several potential security concerns. Here, I'll outline the found issues, their locations, and propose solutions:

1. **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):** Even though explicit hard-coded credentials are not visible, the configuration files loaded in lines 29 and 74-75 (`CONFIG_FILES` and their usage in `init_application`) may contain sensitive information like database passwords, API keys, etc. This is a common practice but can lead to security vulnerabilities if the configuration files are not properly secured.

    - **Solution:** Ensure that configuration files are stored securely with minimal access permissions. Employ a secrets management tool for sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and so on. 

2. **Improper Error Handling (CWE-209):** In the error_application function (lines 65-71), there is a simplistic approach to handling errors that merely returns a text message. While this is not directly a security issue, it could be leveraged to infer the application's state or existence of certain features, leading to more targeted attacks.

    - **Solution:** Implement a more sophisticated error-handling mechanism that logs errors internally while providing non-descriptive error messages to the users. Consider returning standardized HTTP error status codes and messages.

3. **Insecure Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732):** The script might be creating or accessing files (e.g., configuration files in lines 34-39) with insecure permissions, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized users. This isn't explicitly shown but is a common risk in applications that read from or write to the filesystem.

    - **Solution:** Ensure that the application sets strict file permissions when creating or accessing files. Use operating system features or APIs to set file permissions to restrict access to authorized users only.

4. **Potential Command Injection (CWE-77):** While not explicitly demonstrated, the function `_setup_service` (lines 42-62) takes input that could potentially come from user input (via configuration or other means) and includes it in a command context (line 43 where `binary` is constructed). If external input is ever used in this context, it could lead to command injection.

    - **Solution:** Always validate and sanitize inputs, especially those that can influence command line arguments or those used in a command context. Employ parameterized APIs to avoid direct command execution with user-controlled input.

5. **Logging Sensitive Information (CWE-532):** The logging in lines 81-91 might inadvertently log sensitive information since it dumps configuration options which might include passwords, API keys, etc.

    - **Solution:** Configure the logging mechanism to exclude sensitive information from logs. Use logging filters or modify the logging setup to ensure sensitive information is never written to log files.

Please note, the direct code lines mentioned do not imply that the vulnerabilities exist plainly at those lines but suggest areas related to those line numbers where vulnerabilities typically arise based on practices seen. Always consider the context and actual data handling around those areas for accurate assessment.
