After reviewing the provided code fragment with the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards in mind, a couple of security concerns stand out, particularly around information exposure through an error message and potentially unsafe transformation functions:

1. **Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209)**: Line 80 raises a `RuntimeError` that includes the key being set which does not exist in the extra attributes table. Including detailed error information can lead to information exposure vulnerabilities, especially if the error messages are detailed and not properly handled. Although it is only a minor risk since it depends on how the application logs and handles these exceptions, it's generally recommended to avoid revealing too much information in error messages.

   **Solution**: Replace the detailed error message with a more generic one or ensure that such sensitive details are not logged in an unsecured manner.

2. **Improper Neutralization (CWE-94, CWE-502)**: The transformation functions `transform_to_db` and `transform_from_db` (named `to_db` and `from_db` within the method `set_extra_attr_value`) on lines 35, 36, 67, and 49 respectively, could potentially lead to code injection vulnerabilities if not properly implemented. Given that these functions are used to transform user-supplied input before saving it to or reading it from the database, if they perform any sort of evaluation of the input without proper validation, they could be exploited to inject malicious code.

   **Solution**: Ensure that `transform_to_db` and `transform_from_db` functions thoroughly validate and sanitize the input to prevent code execution. It would be prudent to carefully review the implementation of these functions to ensure they do not evaluate user-controlled inputs in an unsafe manner.

Please note that without the implementation details of the transforms and knowing the context in which this code runs (e.g., how the input is validated before reaching this point and how errors are logged and handled), it is challenging to identify all potential security defects. These suggestions are based on common best practices and potential risks inferred from the code snippet provided.
