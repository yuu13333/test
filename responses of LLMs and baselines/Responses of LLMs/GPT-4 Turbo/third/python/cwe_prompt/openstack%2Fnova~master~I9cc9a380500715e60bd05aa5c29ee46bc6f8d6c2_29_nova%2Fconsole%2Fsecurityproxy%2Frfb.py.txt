After reviewing the provided code with the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard, it's evident that the code contains several potential security defects related to insufficient encryption strength and improper error handling. Below are the identified issues, their corresponding line numbers, and suggested solutions:

1. **Use of Weak Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)**
   
   - **Description**: The code implies the use of "None" authentication type for the client (lines 39 and 143-144), which does not provide any cryptographic strength. This could expose the communication to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
   
   - **Solution**: Implement a stronger authentication and encryption mechanism to protect the communication. This could involve using TLS for the connection or applying a secure authentication method followed by encrypted communication.

2. **Insufficient Logging of Errors (CWE-778)**

   - **Description**: When an error occurs during the negotiation with the client or the server, the error is logged at a debug level (line 180) or not logged at all after sending an error response to the client (lines 63, 68). This insufficient logging could make it harder to detect and respond to attacks or failures in a timely manner.

   - **Solution**: Increase the logging level for these scenarios to ensure that errors are properly logged and can be monitored. Use warning or error levels for logging the failure of security critical functions.

3. **Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209)**

   - **Description**: The error messages returned to the client or logged could reveal details about the internal state or configuration that could be useful to an attacker (examples on lines 63, 68, and 180).

   - **Solution**: Standardize error messages to avoid revealing detailed information about the failure or internal state. Ensure that error messages provide necessary information to legitimate users without exposing sensitive details.

It's important for the development team to address these issues to ensure that the application's security stance is robust. Implementing the recommended solutions would help mitigate the potential risks associated with these weaknesses.
