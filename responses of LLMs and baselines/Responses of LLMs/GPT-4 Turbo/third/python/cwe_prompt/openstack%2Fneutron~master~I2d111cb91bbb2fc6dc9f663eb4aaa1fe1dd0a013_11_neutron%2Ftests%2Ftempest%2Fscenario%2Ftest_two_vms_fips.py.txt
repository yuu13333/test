After reviewing your provided code, it seems to adhere to basic security practices. However, there is a possible area of concern - a CWE-862: Missing Authorization. 

Here is the explanation and corresponding problem in the provided code:

Line 33 to 36: Although you are creating a network, subnet, and a router, there doesn’t seem to be any form of access control or authorization process before these resources are created.

Solution:

You might want to consider adding access control or authorization checks before these resources are created to ensure that only authorized users can perform these actions. Furthermore, it is generally a good practice to limit the reach of your application’s functionalities based on the principle of least privilege (PoLP). 

Please be reminded this vulnerability is based on the assumption that this script is executed in an environment where one or more users have different privilege levels. If it's not the case, you could say that the code is safe to use in its context. Nevertheless, it's a good practice to always implement access control where possible to guarantee the continuous safety of the system when the script's environment changes or when it's implemented elsewhere.
