Based on my review, no security defects are detected in the code. The code seems to follow good coding practices, and it doesn't contain any obvious weaknesses according to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. However, please note that a complete security review often involves more than just code examination and may include threat modeling and careful testing.
