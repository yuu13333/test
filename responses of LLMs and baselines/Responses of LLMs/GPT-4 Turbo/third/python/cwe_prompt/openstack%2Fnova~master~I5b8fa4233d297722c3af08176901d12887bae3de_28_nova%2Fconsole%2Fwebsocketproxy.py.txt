Reviewing the provided code snippet for security defects against the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standard uncovers potential vulnerabilities. Below are the identified security defects outlined with their corresponding line numbers and recommended solutions:

1. **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (lines 86-104)**
   The token used for authentication is transmitted in cleartext which could be exposed if the connection is not encrypted (HTTPS). While the code tries to handle tokens securely by masking them in logs (line 109), the initial extract and transmission could still be vulnerable if HTTPS is not enforced.
   
   **Solution:** Ensure that all connections are encrypted by enforcing the use of HTTPS for the entire session. Additionally, consider using secure methods for token transmission like HTTP headers with proper encryption rather than passing them in URL query strings or cookies.

2. **CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data (lines 115-138)**
   The validation of the 'Origin' header to mitigate CSRF attacks can be bypassed if an attacker manages to spoof this header. The code assumes the 'Origin' header is immutable and properly reflects the client's origin, which might not always be the case.
   
   **Solution:** Employ additional CSRF protection mechanisms. One approach could be to implement anti-CSRF tokens that are checked server-side with each request. This reduces reliance solely on headers that could potentially be controlled by an attacker.

3. **CWE-200: Information Exposure (line 101)**
   Logging the fact that a cookie was malformed could help an attacker in refining their attacks to bypass the security measures. Although the cookie content is not directly logged, indicating a malformed cookie could provide clues to an attacker.
   
   **Solution:** Limit the information logged about malformed cookies or any input validation failures. Instead, log an ambiguous message that doesn't distinguish between different types of errors, to prevent attackers from gaining insights into the underlying validation mechanisms.

4. **CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')**
   While not directly shown in the code, the function `new_websocket_client` (lines 67-86) indirectly hints at redirecting to URLs based on parsed query parameters without sufficient validation. If the application redirects to a URL obtained from user input (e.g., the 'token' parameter), it may inadvertently redirect users to malicious sites.
   
   **Solution:** Always validate and sanitize any URLs obtained from user input before using them for redirection. Maintain a list of allowed URLs or URL patterns and ensure the redirect target matches one of the allowed entries.

5. **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (line 148)**
   Establishing socket connections (`tsock = self.socket(host, port, connect=True)`) without limiting the number of connections or implementing throttling can make the application vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by exhausting available system resources.
   
   **Solution:** Implement connection rate limiting and ensure there are adequate controls to prevent an excessive number of concurrent connections. Additionally, consider using a timeout for socket operations to avoid resource exhaustion due to hanging connections.

To address these issues, it's crucial to implement the suggested solutions and ensure that the application code follows best practices for security, particularly when handling sensitive information and user input.
