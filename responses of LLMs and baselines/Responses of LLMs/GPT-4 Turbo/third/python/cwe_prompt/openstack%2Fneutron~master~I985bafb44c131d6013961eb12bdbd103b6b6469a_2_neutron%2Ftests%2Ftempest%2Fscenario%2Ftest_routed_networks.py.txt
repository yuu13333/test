Reviewing the provided code with a focus on potential security defects in relation to the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards reveals a couple of potential issues:

1. **Use of Hard-coded Credentials** (CWE-259):
    - The code sample does not explicitly contain hardcoded passwords or cryptographic keys, but the method `_ssh_check` in lines 111-136, implies the use of SSH private keys for authentication. When implemented improperly, this could lead to the exposure of these credentials if they're not managed securely.
  
2. **Command Injection** (CWE-77): 
    - Line 124-135: The use of `subprocess.call` with `shell=True` and concatenating command strings with user-controllable input (in this case, `namespace` and `ssh_commands`) can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the inputs are not properly sanitized or validated.

3. **Insecure Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** (CWE-732):
    - While the code directly does not showcase file permission problems, lines 124-135, which deal with writing private keys to a temporary file and then deleting it, can potentially be mishandled, leading to insecure permission settings on sensitive files (SSH private keys in this case).

**Solutions:**

1. For **Use of Hard-coded Credentials**, ensure:
    - SSH keys or any credentials are stored securely, using a secrets management tool.
    - Access to these credentials is restricted to only those who require it.

2. For **Command Injection**:
    - Avoid using `shell=True` with `subprocess.call()` and instead use `subprocess.Popen()` with a list of command arguments to prevent shell injection.
    - Always sanitize and validate user input, especially when it's used to construct shell commands.

3. For **Insecure Permission Assignment**:
    - Securely handle files containing sensitive information (like SSH private keys) by setting appropriate file permissions. This can include making the file readable only by the user that needs it and no one else.
    - Consider the use of in-memory storage for transient sensitive information that doesn't need to be written to disk.

Note: It's important to thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs and handle credentials and sensitive data with high security, utilizing best practices and security frameworks where applicable.
