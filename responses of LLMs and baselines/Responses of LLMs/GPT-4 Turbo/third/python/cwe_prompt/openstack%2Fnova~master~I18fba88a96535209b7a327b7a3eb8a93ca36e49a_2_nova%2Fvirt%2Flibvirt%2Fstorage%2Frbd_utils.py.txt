Upon thorough analysis of the Python code, I found that no explicit security defects can be identified through the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) reference standard. The code primarily deals with RBD volumes and closely follows exception handling, which makes it safe against major security defects such as 'Improper Input Validation', 'Improper Neutralization of Special Elements', 'Improper Access Control' et cetera. Yet this doesn't mean that the code is entirely devoid of potential security risks as detailed security analysis usually requires the context in which the code runs along with its interaction with other pieces of software. Producing a comprehensive review usually relies on the examination of the runtime environment and deep analysis using specialized tools. Therefore, it's recommended to further review the code in its specific context and potentially consult with a professional security audit service. 

As it stands, no security defects are detected in the code based on the given sample.
