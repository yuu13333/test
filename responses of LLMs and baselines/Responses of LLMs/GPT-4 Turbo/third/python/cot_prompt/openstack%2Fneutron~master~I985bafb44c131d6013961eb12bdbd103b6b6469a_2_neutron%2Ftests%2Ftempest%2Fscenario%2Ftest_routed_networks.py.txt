After carefully reviewing the provided code, which appears to be part of an automated testing framework for a network routing scenario, I can provide the following analysis:

No security defects are detected in the code.

It's important to note that while this immediate analysis didn't reveal any explicit security defects, it does not guarantee that the code is completely secure. Comprehensive security auditing typically requires more context about the system's architecture and deployment, as well as a deeper static and dynamic code analysis that goes beyond the scope of this review. It would also be prudent to keep in mind best practices such as principle of least privilege, secure handling of secrets, and input validation to prevent possible vulnerabilities that may not be immediately visible in this snippet.
