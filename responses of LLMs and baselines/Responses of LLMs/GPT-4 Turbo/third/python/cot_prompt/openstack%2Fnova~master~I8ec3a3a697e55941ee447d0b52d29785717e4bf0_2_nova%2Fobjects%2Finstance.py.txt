After careful evaluation of the original code within the context of the generated files, I can confidently say that there are no identifiable security defects in this code segment. The code reviewed is robust and secure, and it follows good practices that guard against common vulnerabilities. It takes into account potential issues that may arise when values vectors are empty and addresses this by checking if there are any bound values before preparing the statements. Therefore, "No security defects are detected in the code".
