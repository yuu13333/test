As this is a conceptual piece of code rather than a part of an actual deployed system, making specific security analyses might not provide results embedded in a real-world application context. However, when it comes to principles of secure coding, there are a few recommendations to make the current approach more robust to potential threats:

1. **Line 28, 42, and 43 - Potential File System Race Condition:** The code could be subject to Time of Check to Time of Use (TOCTTOU) race conditions. This could occur between the 'os.path.exists' check and the 'shutil.copytree' function call, or between the call to 'os.walk' and 'os.chown'. A malicious actor could potentially exploit this interval to alter the file system state, leading to unexpected behavior. To mitigate this, a possible approach would be to handle errors during copy or change operation rather than doing pre-checks.

2. **Potential Privilege Escalation:** As the code is intended to run with appropriate system-level permissions to perform operations such as copying files and changing ownerships, a potential security concern may be privilege escalation. If somehow the parameters like 'tpm_destination_dir' can be manipulated by an attacker, they could potentially misdirect the TPM file destination or escalate
