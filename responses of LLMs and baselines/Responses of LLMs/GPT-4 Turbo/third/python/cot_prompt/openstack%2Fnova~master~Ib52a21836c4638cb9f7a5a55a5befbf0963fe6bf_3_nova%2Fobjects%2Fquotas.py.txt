After a thorough examination of the provided code, I can confirm that '''No security defects are detected in the code'''. The code primarily deals with checking and managing resource quotas in a cloud infrastructure, which doesn't involve any direct user inputs or sensitive data manipulation that could potentially introduce security defects, provided the proper role-based access control is maintained elsewhere in the system. Nonetheless, it is always important to regularly audit and test the system for any potential security vulnerabilities.
