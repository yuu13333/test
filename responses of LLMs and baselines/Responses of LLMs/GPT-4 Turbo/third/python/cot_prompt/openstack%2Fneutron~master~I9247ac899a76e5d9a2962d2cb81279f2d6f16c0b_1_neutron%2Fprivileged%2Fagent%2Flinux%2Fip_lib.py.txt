After thoroughly reviewing the code provided, focusing on security-specific considerations such as input validation, exception handling, resource management, and potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited (e.g., buffer overflows, injection vulnerabilities, etc.), I can conclude:

**No security defects are detected in the code.**

This assessment is based on the information available and the specific context of the code usage. It is essential to ensure that all external data used within these functions is validated and sanitized appropriately to avoid possible vulnerabilities such as injection attacks. Furthermore, ensuring that the code runs with the least privileges necessary for performing its intended functions can help mitigate the potential impact of any undiscovered vulnerabilities. Regular code reviews and security audits are recommended to maintain and improve the security posture of the software.
