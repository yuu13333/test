No security defects are detected in the code. 

For a thorough security audit of the code, however, it is generally necessary to have access to the full context and usage of the codebase, including any external libraries or frameworks that might be integrated. Static analysis tools, code review, and testing environments would be used to identify any potential security issues such as SQL injection vulnerabilities, improper error handling, insecure data transmission, or issues with authentication and authorization mechanisms. 

If you are conducting a security review, consider utilizing these methods alongside manual code review to ensure the security of your codebase.
