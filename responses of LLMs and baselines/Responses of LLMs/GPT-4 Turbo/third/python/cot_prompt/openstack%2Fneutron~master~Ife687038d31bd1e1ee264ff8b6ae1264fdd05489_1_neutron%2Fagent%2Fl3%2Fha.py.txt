No security defects are detected in the code. 

The given code is a small snippet, mainly dealing with configuration and state change notifications for HA routers. It does not deal directly with authentication, encryption, or user data handling, which are common areas for security defects. Without broader context or access to the rest of the codebase, and considering that no obvious security vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, buffer overflows, or incorrect exception handling are present within this particular excerpt, there don't appear to be security defects in this specific part of the code.

Nonetheless, for a comprehensive security audit, it's critical to analyze the complete code, especially parts dealing with network communications, data storage, and user authentication, where security defects are more likely to occur. It's also important to consider the security of the environment in which this code runs and ensure that all dependencies and infrastructure components adhere to best security practices.
