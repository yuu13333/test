Based on the provided code snippet, no security defects are detected in the code. The snippet seems to be part of a header file for a settings page class definition, and without the implementation of the methods and more context, it's difficult to perform a thorough security review. The code is primarily declarative and lacks dynamic operations that could typically introduce security risks such as buffer overflows, improper input validation, and so on.
For a comprehensive security review, one would need to see the corresponding source (.cpp) files where the methods are defined and where the actual logic is implemented. Additionally, information on how user inputs are handled and how data is being processed would be necessary for a more in-depth security analysis.
