Examining the code provided, it appears to be well written and no obvious security defects stand out. It is primarily querying time and performing calculations based on the results. Various precautions, such as checking if the high-resolution performance counter is available, are in place to prevent division by zero errors.
However, there is one point that could potentially be an issue, although it's not strictly a 'security' defect. There is a Q_ASSERT_X on line 98, following the QueryPerformanceCounter call. Assertions can be useful during debugging, but by default they are compiled out in the release version of a program. If QueryPerformanceCounter failed but the code was compiled with QT_NO_DEBUG defined, this would go unnoticed. It might be advisable to add a check handling this case with an error or fallback.
In summary, no specific security defects are detected in the code, but careful error handling considerations are advised.
