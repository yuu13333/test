After carefully reviewing the provided code, I've identified a potential security defect related to the usage of SSL/TLS.
The problem lies in line 174 of the code: config.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyNone);
This line is setting the peer verification mode for the SSL/TLS handshake to none, essentially meaning the client doesn't have to present a valid certificate for the connection to be established. This makes the connection vulnerable to certain types of attacks like man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker can snoop, manipulate or hijack the client-server communication since mutual authentication is not enforced.
The solution is to employ proper peer verification. You should use QSslSocket::VerifyPeer instead of QSslSocket::VerifyNone. With this mode, if the verification fails, the connection will not be established.
So line 174 should be changed to config.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyPeer);
This way, the system will indeed check the certificate chain of the peer (in this case the client), effectively enhancing security levels.
In addition to this, it's good practice to handle certificate errors using the QSslSocket::sslErrors signal to capture and handle any anomalies during the connection, such as expired certificates.
