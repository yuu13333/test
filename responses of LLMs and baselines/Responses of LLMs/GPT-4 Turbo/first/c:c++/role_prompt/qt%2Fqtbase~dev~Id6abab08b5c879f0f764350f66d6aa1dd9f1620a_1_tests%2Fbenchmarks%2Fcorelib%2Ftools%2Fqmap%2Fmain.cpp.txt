After carefully reviewing the provided Qt code, there seems to be no apparent security defects. All values inserted into QMap are simply timestamps or strings with no questionable operations performed on them. There don't seem to be any usage of insecure functions that can lead to buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, etc. There are also no signs of using insecure network communication or insecure file I/O, nor are there any hardcoded critical credentials.
So, I can say that '''No security defects are detected in the code'''. However, it's important to keep in mind that security also largely depends on usage. As long as the user input is properly sanitized before it's used and sensitive information is handled carefully, this code should remain secure.
