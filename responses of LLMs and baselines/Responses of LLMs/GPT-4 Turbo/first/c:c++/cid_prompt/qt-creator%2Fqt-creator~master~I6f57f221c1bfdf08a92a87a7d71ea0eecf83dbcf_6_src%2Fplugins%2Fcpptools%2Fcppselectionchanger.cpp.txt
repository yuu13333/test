I've reviewed the provided code, taking into account the specified Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories, which are related to security defects that could potentially be exploited in software. Upon this inspection, I did not identify obvious security defects or weaknesses that correspond directly with the specified categories. Each category you mentioned is quite particular, and from the given code, which appears to be concerned with text selection within an IDE component, I didn't notice any code patterns that would obviously lead to issues like improper access control, incorrect calculations, or improper management of resource lifetimes.

However, it is important to note that without context, such as how this component interacts with the rest of the system, what kind of input it receives, or how it is intended to be used, it's possible that relevant security defects might not be immediately visible within the static code alone. Security reviews often benefit from additional context and dynamic analysis such as testing the component within its application environment and checking how it handles various input edge cases. Therefore, I can only state that 'No security defects are detected in the code,' with the caveat that some issues might only be identifiable with a more thorough dynamic analysis or with additional contextual information.
