In reviewing the code, the following potential security defects were identified:

1. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
The use of `new QMenu(this)` within the method `contextMenuEvent` at line 351 dynamically allocates a `QMenu` without a corresponding delete operation. This memory is not being freed, which could lead to a memory leak if the context menu is opened multiple times. To fix this, consider creating this object on the stack, or managing its lifetime properly with smart pointers if dynamic allocation is necessary.

2. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
There is a lack of input validation in `PresetEditor::writePresets` at lines 517-550 for the provided easing curve. Before saving, it only checks if the curve is legal (`!curve.isLegal()`). More comprehensive validation or normalization of the input curve should be performed to ensure that only legitimate data is being processed, depending on the security requirements and possible risks around the curve data.

3. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
The code seems to have variables with inconsistent naming conventions, like `spacingg` at line 54, which appears to be a typo and should be corrected to match the naming standards used throughout the codebase (e.g., `spacing`).

Please address these issues by correcting the potential memory leak, validating input more comprehensively, and adhering to coding standards for variable naming. It's also recommended to perform a thorough code audit and testing to ensure other potential issues are resolved before production use.
