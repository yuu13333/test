After reviewing the provided code, it seems there is an issue related to CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime, which specifically concerns the management of object lifetimes within the code.

In the code snippet provided, the issue appears in the following lines:

```
87     {
88         QObject *badOwner = new QObject();
89         QGuiApplicationPrivate::instance()->shortcutMap.addShortcut(
90                     badOwner, QKeySequence(QKeySequence::StandardKey::Delete),
91                     Qt::ShortcutContext::WindowShortcut, simpleContextMatcher);
92         delete badOwner;
93     }
```

Here, an `QObject` (`badOwner`) is created on line 88 and is used on line 89 to add a shortcut to the global `shortcutMap`. However, immediately after, on line 92, the `badOwner` object is deleted without first removing the shortcut from the `shortcutMap`. This results in the shortcut still referencing the deleted `QObject`, potentially leading to undefined behavior or a crash when the shortcut is triggered (e.g., when a key is pressed).

The proper way to handle this would be to ensure the shortcut is removed from the `shortcutMap` before the `QObject` (`badOwner`) is destroyed. This can be amended by calling a remove function, which should be provided by the `shortcutMap` object to unregister the shortcut safely before deleting `badOwner`.

To resolve this issue, one should modify the code to remove the shortcut associated with `badOwner` before proceeding to delete the owner object. If such a removal method exists in the `QShortcutMap` class, it should be called with appropriate parameters to cleanly unregister the shortcut prior to the deletion of `badOwner`. The corrected code would look something like:

```cpp
87     {
88         QObject *badOwner = new QObject();
89         QGuiApplicationPrivate::instance()->shortcutMap.addShortcut(
90                     badOwner, QKeySequence(QKeySequence::StandardKey::Delete),
91                     Qt::ShortcutContext::WindowShortcut, simpleContextMatcher);
92         // Assuming a removeShortcut method exists, use it to remove the shortcut
93         QGuiApplicationPrivate::instance()->shortcutMap.removeShortcut(badOwner);
94         delete badOwner; // Now it is safe to delete badOwner
95     }
```
Note: The actual method to remove the shortcut may have a different name and might require different parameters depending on the framework implementation.
