After reviewing the provided code, I did not detect explicit security defects related to the specific CWEs mentioned in your request. However, it is important to note that code security audits often require a broader context such as how the functions are used, the environment in which they are deployed, and the overall architecture of the application. It's also essential to consider that static analysis like this can miss runtime issues or logic flaws that might be exploitable.

If this code were part of a larger codebase, a full security review might uncover interactions or uses of this functionality that could lead to security issues. It's recommended to employ dynamic analysis, fuzz testing, and a thorough code audit in a complete development environment for a comprehensive security review.
