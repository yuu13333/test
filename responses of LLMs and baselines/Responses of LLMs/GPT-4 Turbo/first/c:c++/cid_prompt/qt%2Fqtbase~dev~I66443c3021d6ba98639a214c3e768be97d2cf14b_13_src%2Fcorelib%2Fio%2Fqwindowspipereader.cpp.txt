After examining the provided C++ source code, I found some potential security defects: 

1. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
The code uses multiple Windows HANDLEs (`eventHandle`, `syncHandle`, and `waitObject`) which are resources that must be properly managed. It appears that they are closed properly in the destructor (lines 76-86), however, if exceptions or other kinds of abrupt termination occur between the creation and disposal of these handles, they may not be released. Also, the proper checks after creating these resources are not being made; for instance, the code checks if `waitObject` is `NULL` (line 72) but does not do so for `eventHandle` and `syncHandle` after they are created.

2. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
There might be a lack of sufficient checking for the successful creation of handles. After `CreateEvent` and `CreateThreadpoolWait` (lines 55, 56, 71), there should be checks to ensure these calls did not return `NULL`, which would indicate an error. Without proper error checking, subsequent code may use invalid handles, leading to undefined behavior or system errors.

3. CWE-667 (Improper Locking)
In the function `cancelAsyncRead` (line 128), if `CancelIoEx` fails unexpectedly for reasons other than `ERROR_NOT_FOUND` (line 141), it could potentially indicate that the operation's cancellation was not successful, which might leave the read operation in an incomplete state.
 
4. CWE-662 (Weaknesses in the Control of Information Flow)
The functions `waitForNotification`, `waitForReadyRead`, and `waitForPipeClosed` (lines 455, 481, 494 respectively) use a loop and Sleep. `waitForPipeClosed` particularly does not limit the number of iterations which can cause the methods to potentially block longer than expected if there are continuously new data or other conditions preventing the expected state.

5. CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable)
There is a potential use of uninitialized memory starting at line 455 (`waitForNotification` function). The variable `msecs` could be used in the loop without a proper initialization if `timeout` is 0. However, this is a minor issue because `qt_subtract_from_timeout` function is likely to set the value correctly based on `timeout`, but since this function is not part of the code snippet, it can't be confirmed.

To address these issues, proper checks for handle creation should be implemented, with corresponding error handling and resource cleanup. Furthermore, consider adding a strategy for dealing with exceptions to ensure that resources are always released correctly. Careful review and management around synchronization primitives, loop conditions, and potential blocking operations should also be made to prevent deadlocks or unresponsive behavior.
