After carefully reviewing the code, no security defects related to the specified CWEs are detected. It appears to be concerned with the registration and handling of calendar backends and their associated methods. The code facilitates the interaction with calendar systems, month, and day calculations, as well as ensures thread-safe operation and proper management of resource lifetimes. The code properly locks shared resources for modifications, manages the lifetime of objects, and performs necessary checks for valid states and conditions.

Therefore, my conclusion is: 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
