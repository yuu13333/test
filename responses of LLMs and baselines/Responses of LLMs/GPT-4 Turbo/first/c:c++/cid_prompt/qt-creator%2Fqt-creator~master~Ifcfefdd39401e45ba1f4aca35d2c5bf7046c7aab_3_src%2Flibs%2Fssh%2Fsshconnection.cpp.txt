No security defects are detected in the code.

The given code is part of an SSH connection class which utilizes an OpenSSH client for operations. Here's why it's free from the listed Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs):

1. CWE-284: There's no evidence in the code snippet of improper access control. The code primarily deals with setting up and managing SSH connections.

2. CWE-435: There appears to be no improper interaction between the multiple entities that this code is managing.

3. CWE-664: The code seems to manage resources responsibly, such as through the use of std::unique_ptr for the master socket directory, ensuring that it is properly cleaned up.

4. CWE-682: No logical operations are performed that involve calculations, thus ruling out the issue of incorrect calculations.

5. CWE-691: The control flow across the code is consistent and manages states and errors effectively.

6. CWE-693: This snippet does not show the direct implementation of protection mechanisms, but it appropriately handles SSH connection errors and states.

7. CWE-697: Comparisons made in the code, such as in the operator== overloads, are consistent and do not display incorrect behavior.

8. CWE-703: Checks and exception handling are addressed properly; for example, assert statements (such as `QTC_ASSERT`) are in place to ensure that the SSH connection is in the right state before performing certain operations.

9. CWE-707: No evidence of improper neutralization, such as command injection or SQL injection, was found within the given code.

10. CWE-710: The code adheres to established coding standards, which are suggested by the usage of Qt-specific constructs, naming conventions, and assert macros.

Please note that the evaluation of security defects from code snippets has limitations due to the lack of context on how the code is used, its integration with other components, and the broader codebase. Full evaluation would additionally require dynamic analysis, testing, and understanding of the operational environment.
