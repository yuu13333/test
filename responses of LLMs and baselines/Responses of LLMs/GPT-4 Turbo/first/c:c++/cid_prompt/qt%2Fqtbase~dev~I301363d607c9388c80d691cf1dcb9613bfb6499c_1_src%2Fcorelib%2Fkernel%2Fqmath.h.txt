After reviewing the provided code snippet, I found no specific security defects according to the categories listed:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):**
   Nothing in the code snippet seems to control access to resources improperly.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):**
   The code doesn't show any interactions between multiple entities that could lead to security issues.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):**
   There are no apparent issues with resource management in this math utility code.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**
   The mathematical functions here wrap standard library functions, and no incorrect calculations are evident.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):**
   Control flow is basic and correctly manages the scope of each function.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):**
   The code doesn't seem to implement or rely on any security protection mechanisms that could fail.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):**
   All operations are standard mathematical calls without any comparison logic that appears to be incorrect.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):**
   The mathematical functions do not appear to involve any exceptional condition checks.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):**
   There are no inputs being neutralized in this code snippet; it merely provides math utility functions.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):**
    The code adheres to coding standards, using templates and constexpr expressions as part of modern C++ practices.

No security defects are detected in the code according to the outlined CWE criteria. It's important to note that this analysis is based on the static code provided. A dynamic analysis or the broader context of the entire application might reveal issues not visible in this isolated code snippet. The assumption is also that the math functions are correctly defined in the C++ standard library, and standard security practices are followed elsewhere in the application that makes use of these utility functions.
