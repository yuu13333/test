No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code defines the `QLine` and `QLineF` classes in the QtCore module of the Qt Toolkit. These classes handle geometric line representations and support basic operations such as setting points, translation, and length adjustment. The methods are defined with safety checks like `qFuzzyCompare` for floating-point comparison, which is a good practice.

All methods and operations related to these classes are straightforward and do not involve any complex control flows, access control issues, resource management, or calculations that could introduce the CWE defects listed. Furthermore, the use of `constexpr` where possible suggests an emphasis on compile-time calculation and optimization, which can prevent certain runtime defects.

The code adheres to the coding standards of Qt and C++ in general, with clear method definitions and inline documentation. It also guards certain methods with compile-time checks (e.g., QT_NO_DEBUG_STREAM).

Hence, based on the provided CWE defect types, this code does not exhibit any of the common security weaknesses associated with them.
