No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code snippet from the QDate, QTime, and QDateTime classes of the QtCore module of the Qt framework doesn't contain elements that would be typically associated with the listed Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). These classes are mainly dealing with date and time representation and calculations and do not directly interact with external entities, handle resources over their lifetime, perform calculations outside the scope of date and time, manage control flows in a way that would pose security concerns, or neutralize inputs in a security-relevant context.

Please note that while the code snippet shown doesn't immediately raise any security red flags concerning the mentioned CWE issues, complete security assurance would require a more thorough analysis in the context of how these classes are used within an application, including potential user inputs and interactions with other system components.
