No security defects are detected in the code based on the provided Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list.

The code is a part of the Qt Network module and handles SSL key operations such as clearing keys from memory, decoding, and converting them to different formats. Here is a review based on the criteria provided:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** The function `clear()` has an optional parameter to deeply clean the key memory or not, which is a correct approach to access control over the key memory cleanliness.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):** There is no improper interaction between multiple entities in the code. The code interacts with OpenSSL, which is a common practice for SSL key operations.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):** The code shows proper control and cleanup of its resources, such as key structures from OpenSSL, using appropriate OpenSSL functions (e.g., `q_RSA_free`, `q_EVP_PKEY_free`).

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):** There does not appear to be a miscalculation. The length of keys is determined using correct OpenSSL attributes and methods (`q_RSA_bits`, `q_DSA_bits`).

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):** Control flow seems to be managed correctly, appropriately handling the conditions for each key algorithm and handling the case where `QSsl::Opaque` keys are involved.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):** There are no evident protection mechanism failures in the code.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):** The `fromEVP_PKEY` function uses correct comparison logic to determine the type of OpenSSL key and manage it accordingly.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** There is error checking after key memory allocation and BIO operations, and overall the code handles exceptional conditions such as an unsupported key algorithm by returning without proceeding.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):** The functions dealing with encryption and decryption (`encrypt`, `decrypt`, and `doCrypt`) accept parameters without neutralization, but it is assumed that the functions are called with well-defined and safe parameters as they are private methods.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):** The code adheres to coding standards, which is evident in its structure, naming conventions, and commentary.

The code heavily relies on the correct functioning of the OpenSSL library. It is assumed that all functions from the Qt library and OpenSSL (`q_*`) have been properly vetted and wrapped to ensure they handle edge-cases and errors correctly without leading to security vulnerabilities.
