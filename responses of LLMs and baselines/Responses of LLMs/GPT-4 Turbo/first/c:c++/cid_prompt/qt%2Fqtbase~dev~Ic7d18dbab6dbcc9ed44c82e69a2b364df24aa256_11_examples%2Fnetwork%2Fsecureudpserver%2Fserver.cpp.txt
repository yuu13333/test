Reviewing the code for the typical CWE categories provided:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):  
   There are no obvious access control issues within the provided code. However, the server configuration disables peer verification with `serverConfiguration.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyNone);` (line 95). This means the server accepts any client without verifying the client's certificate, which can be considered a security defect depending on the use case.

2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):  
   There doesn't appear to be improper interaction between multiple entities in this snippet.

3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):  
   `shutdown()` (lines 243-251) correctly closes connections and the socket.

4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):  
   There is no complex calculation that appears incorrect.

5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):  
   The functions seem to handle control flow properly, with checks for `isListening`, `pendingDatagramSize`, and whether handshake or decryption was successful.

6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):  
   Intentionally disabling peer verification may lead to security issues if not handled correctly elsewhere.

7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):  
   Comparisons in the code, such as the check for a valid peer address and port (lines 147-150), seem correct.

8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):  
   Appropriate checks and logging are implemented, e.g., when reading datagrams fails (line 141) and when working with DTLS connections.

9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):  
   There doesn't seem to be a risk of code injection or other forms of attacks that require neutralization.

10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):  
    The code follows a good structure and coherent naming practices and appears to adhere to coding standards.

The main security concern here is the disabled peer verification, which might be acceptable if this is a controlled environment or if there is some other form of access control. Otherwise, enabling peer verification is critical for preventing man-in-the-middle attacks in a production environment. If this setting is crucial to your application's security, you should enable and properly configure `QSslSocket::VerifyPeer` or an equivalent peer verification mode.
