Upon reviewing the code provided for security defects with the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) as a reference standard, one potential security risk is as follows:

### CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')

**Vulnerability Description:** The use of `qFatal` to terminate the program when encountering errors (lines 187, 192, 223, and 254) includes untrusted data (`argc`, `name`, and `errorString`) in the error message that is likely written to standard error or another log. If this output is ever read and interpreted by a shell or another interpreter, it could potentially be used to execute commands if an attacker has control over the contents of these variables. While it is generally uncommon for error log outputs to be used in a way that could introduce a command injection vulnerability, using untrusted input in any logging or output context without sanitation can potentially lead to security risks.

**Recommended Solution:** Ensure that any dynamic content is properly escaped in the context in which it is used. While in this case, the risk might be low, it is best to practice output encoding to prevent potential injection vulnerabilities. Instead of directly appending variables like `name` to a format string, consider sanitizing them or using them in a way that cannot be misinterpreted as commands or format specifiers.

Please also note that while direct command injection vulnerabilities do not appear in the given code itself, it's crucial to consciously handle external inputs and outputs that may be used within a context where commands could be executed.

Other potential issues could also stem from the use of regular expressions (e.g., `QRegExp`), which might be vulnerable if crafted maliciously. However, without the input data and a broader system context, it is not possible to definitively evaluate its impact here. Future-proofing the application might involve moving away from regular expressions in favor of more robust parsing solutions when dealing with untrusted input.
