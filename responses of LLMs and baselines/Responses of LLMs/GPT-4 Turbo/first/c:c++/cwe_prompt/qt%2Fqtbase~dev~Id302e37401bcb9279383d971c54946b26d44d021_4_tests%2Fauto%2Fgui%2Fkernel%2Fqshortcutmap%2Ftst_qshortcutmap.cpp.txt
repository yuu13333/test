Overlooking the code, I've identified a security problem referring to improper resource shutdown or release (CWE-404), specifically in the handling of memory for the objects. 

In lines 88 to 93
```cpp
88         QObject *badOwner = new QObject();
89         QGuiApplicationPrivate::instance()->shortcutMap.addShortcut(
90                     badOwner, QKeySequence(QKeySequence::StandardKey::Delete),
91                     Qt::ShortcutContext::WindowShortcut, simpleContextMatcher);
92         delete badOwner;
93     }
```
The program creates a new "QObject" but then deletes it immediately after adding it as a shortcut. As the shortcut still refers to the direction of the object, this could cause undefined behavior, such as a program crash, if a later event attempts to access the shortcut after the object has been deleted.

To correct this, consider implementing a strategy for managing the lifespan of your objects when allocating memory for them, ensuring that they are deleted only when no more references to them exist. This might be done by using smart pointers or a memory management system built into the language you are using. 

Here is a proposed correction for this specific piece of code:

```cpp
88    QScopedPointer<QObject> badOwner(new QObject());
89    QGuiApplicationPrivate::instance()->shortcutMap.addShortcut(
90                 badOwner.data(), QKeySequence(QKeySequence::StandardKey::Delete),
91                 Qt::ShortcutContext::WindowShortcut, simpleContextMatcher);
```
In this example, a QScopedPointer is used to automatically delete the badOwner when it goes out of scope, reducing the risk of memory leaks or undefined behavior. Note that '.data()' is used to pass the raw pointer to the addShortcut function.
