Upon reviewing the code, I was unable to identify any definite security deficiencies based on the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) reference standard. The code does not seem to directly perform risky actions such as executing user-defined input, open files, establish network connections, etc. Thus, there is no ingredient where malicious code may induce flaws such as cross-site scripting (CWE-79), SQL injection (CWE-89), or buffer overflow (CWE-120) vulnerabilities.

However, there are potential areas of concern that need attention:

1. Error Handling - The code doesn't appear to carry out broad error handling, which could lead to unnoticed errors and undesired behavior of the program (CWE-391).

2. Resource Cleanup - In the method 'cancelAndWaitForFinished()' (lines 83-90), it checked if the m_generateFuture and m_updateFuture processes are running and waited for them to finish if they are. However, this code does not handle the scenario where these processes may not terminate successfully, potentially leading to abandoned resources (CWE-404).

3. Missing Default Case in Switch-like Statement - Although not a direct security threat, adding a default case, even if it's expected to be unreachable, can prevent against possible oversights in the future (CWE-478).

Without more surrounding context or the ability to penetrate deeper into the included headers, it's tough to give a more comprehensive judgment. To improve code security, consider incorporating robust error handling and resource cleanup, limit the use of global variables, validate input, and keep safety checks on buffers or limit the use of functions that don't do these checks by themselves.

'No imminent security defects are detected in the code according to the CWE standard'. However, please take the above points into consideration to assure a safer coding practice.
