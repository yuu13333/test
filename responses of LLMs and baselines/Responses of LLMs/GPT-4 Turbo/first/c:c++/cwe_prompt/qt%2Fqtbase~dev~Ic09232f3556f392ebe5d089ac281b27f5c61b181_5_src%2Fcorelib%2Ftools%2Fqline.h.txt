No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code appears to be a part of the Qt framework, specifically the QtCore module, and defines two geometric line classes, `QLine` and `QLineF`. The classes provide methods for handling basic line properties such as getting and setting endpoints, computing the length and angle, translating the line, and checking if the line is null (which in this context means that the line's endpoints are the same).

The functions consist mainly of simple arithmetic and member access operations on the QPoint/QPointF objects that represent the endpoints of the line. The code adheres to the standard C++ practices for such geometric classes and does not show any signs of typical security issues like buffer overflows, input validation problems, or handling of untrusted data that could lead to vulnerabilities.

It's also worth noting that since this code is part of a well-regarded open-source project, it has likely been reviewed by many developers and subjected to various static code analysis tools, which reduces the chances of common vulnerabilities being present.
