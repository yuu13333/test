One potential security defect in the provided code is a logic error that could potentially lead to a memory leak, associated with CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime. 

This potential issue revolves around the management of `QKeyEvent` objects in the following lines:

- Line 193: `QKeyEvent` objects are enqueued with `keyEvents` but are not ensured to be deleted if `sent` is false, which could potentially lead to a memory leak if the `dbusConnection.callWithCallback` method fails.
- Lines 218-219 and 221-223: There is inconsistent handling of `QPair` from `keyEvents`. When the argument is `true`, the `QKeyEvent` is deleted. However, when the argument is `false`, the `QKeyEvent` is posted back to the event queue of the target object without being copied, which means that the ownership of the `QKeyEvent` remains unclear, potentially leading to a double deletion later: once when it's dequeued again and once more when the event system of the application handles it.

The solution to address this defect is to ensure consistent and clear ownership and life-cycle management of `QKeyEvent` objects.

1. Ensure `QKeyEvent` objects are deleted properly if they are not sent successfully.
```cpp
if (!sent) {
    // Code to delete the QKeyEvent object to prevent memory leak
    delete copyKeyEvent(keyEvent);
    return false;
}
```

2. Correct the lifecycle management of `QKeyEvent` when re-posting the event:
```cpp
if (event.first)
    QCoreApplication::postEvent(event.first.data(), new QKeyEvent(*(event.second)));
delete event.second; // Ensure to delete the original QKeyEvent to prevent memory leak
```

Please note that for production code, it is crucial to verify memory management correctness thoroughly to prevent both memory leaks and double deletions.
