During the review of the provided code, one potential security weakness was identified:

### Potential Command Injection (CWE-77)

**Vulnerability Description**:
The methods `runInShell` and `outputForRunInShell` build a shell command string containing user-provided input, which is then passed to the device's shell for execution. The input data is encoded with Base64 and then echoed into a decode command before being piped to other commands. However, if the input data is not properly validated, this could lead to command injection vulnerabilities, as specially crafted input could escape the expected context.

**Affected Lines**:
- Line 97 in the method `runInShellImpl` and line 169 in `outputForRunInShellImpl` both introduce the user-provided `stdInData` into a command string.
- Line 99 (`runInShellImpl`) and line 172 (`outputForRunInShellImpl`) append commands that should capture the return status, but if `stdInData` is not properly sanitized, the shell could interpret part of the input as additional commands.

**Recommended Solution**:
Ensure that all user input is properly sanitized before being incorporated into shell commands. Although the input is being Base64 encoded, which would normally mitigate some risk of injection, additional validation is still advisable. Additionally, consider using more secure methods that don't involve constructing shell command strings with user-controllable input, such as using system calls that take argument arrays, where arguments are passed separately from the command and cannot be misinterpreted as additional commands.

Please revisit the handling of user input within these functions to ensure that it's not possible for malicious input to result in command injection or the execution of unintended commands.
