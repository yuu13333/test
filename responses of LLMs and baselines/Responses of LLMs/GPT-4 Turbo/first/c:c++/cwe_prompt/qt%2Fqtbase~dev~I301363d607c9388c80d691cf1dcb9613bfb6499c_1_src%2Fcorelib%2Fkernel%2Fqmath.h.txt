After analyzing the code snippet provided, which is part of the QtCore module of the Qt Toolkit, no security defects related to the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standard are explicitly detected. This code is a part of a mathematics utility header file providing common mathematical function templates and constants that would be used elsewhere in the Qt framework.

The code defines templates for various mathematical operations such as ceiling, floor, absolute value, trigonometric functions, hyperbolic operations, square root, logarithmic and exponential functions, power functions, and conversions between degrees and radians. It also provides some mathematical constants and fast sin/cos implementations that use a lookup table.

Reviewing mathematical utility functions like this for security defects would typically involve looking for:

- Buffer overflows or underflows (CWE-119, CWE-121, etc.)
- Integer overflows or wraparounds (CWE-190)
- Insecure randomness (CWE-330)
- Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798)
- Improper input validation (CWE-20)

The functions in this utility file do not manage memory allocation, do not seem to include any randomness, and are not related to authentication or credential management. The inputs to these functions should be validated by the caller, and the mathematical operations performed here are based on standard library functions known to be safe.

Thus, based on the information available and within the context of this code:
No security defects are detected in the code.
