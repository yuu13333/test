Based on my analysis, there is a security defect in the code you provided. 

Line 97 involves broadcasting UDP message, representing a potential security threat referred to as CWE-200: Information Exposure. In this case, sensitive information is being broadcasted without any encryption or security measures, which could be intercepted and exploited by malicious parties.

Suggested fix:
Consider using encryption or an alternative secure manner for sensitive data transmission, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, to prevent interception and exposure of information. 

Modified code: 
Before broadcasting the UDP message, the datagram should first be encrypted. A sample encryption process using QTcpSocket and QSslSocket instead of QUdpSocket could look something like this:

```c++
QSslSocket *sslSocket = new QSslSocket(this);
sslSocket->connectToHostEncrypted("host", 123); // Connect to the host
// Wait for encrypted connection: 
if(!sslSocket->waitForEncrypted()){ 
    qDebug() << sslSocket->errorString(); 
    return; 
}

// After connection and encryption are established 
// In place of broadcasting a UDP message, write to the socket:
QByteArray block;    
QDataStream out(&block, QIODevice::WriteOnly);
out.setVersion(QDataStream::Qt_4_0);
out << (quint16)0;    
out << messageNo; 
out.device()->seek(0);  
out << (quint16)(block.size() - sizeof(quint16));
sslSocket->write(block);
```
This approach ensures safer transmission of data by creating an encrypted connection before sending the datagram, and is a standard practice for data security. Please adjust the code to fit within your current development environment and software architecture.
