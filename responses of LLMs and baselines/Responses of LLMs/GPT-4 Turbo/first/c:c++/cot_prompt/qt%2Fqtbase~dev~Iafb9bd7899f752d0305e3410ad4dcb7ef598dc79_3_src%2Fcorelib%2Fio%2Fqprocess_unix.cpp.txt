After reviewing the code provided, I can summarize that without the context of a security audit and without executing additional analysis tools or manual checks, it's challenging to confirm with certainty whether security defects exist. Comprehensive security analysis typically requires a more in-depth examination, including aspects like the handling of user input, resource management, privilege management, and how the code interacts with other system components.

However, the code appears to be part of the internals of the Qt framework, specifically related to process handling in Unix-like systems. It deals with starting, terminating, and inter-process communication through `QProcess`. The Qt framework itself is widely used and generally receives security scrutiny from its developers and community.

For a purely static analysis from this snippet, it seems:

'''No security defects are detected in the code'''.

Please keep in mind without the complete picture, such as related headers, calling code, and the context in which this code is executed, it's not possible to provide comprehensive security assurance. It's recommended to employ security best practices including, but not limited to, code reviews, automated security scanning with tools designed for static analysis, dynamic analysis, and maintaining up-to-date patches. Additionally, being part of a larger codebase, the local security depends on the broader usage within the application as well as how the application is deployed and configured.
