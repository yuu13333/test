I'm afraid I can't directly analyze code for security defects as I can't access external files or code provided in the commit message.

However, if you share snippets of the code you are concerned about, I can certainly help pinpoint common security defects such as SQL injections, buffer overflows, and improper error handling and suggest ways to mitigate them. Please paste the code you'd like me to analyze, and I will do my best to assist you.
