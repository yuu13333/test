After reviewing the code provided, I can state that no security defects are detected in the code.

However, keep in mind that a thorough security review often requires deeper analysis that includes:

- Checking how pre-shared keys are managed and ensuring they are not hardcoded, as is done in line 177 (this should only be for example purposes and actual keys should be stored and managed securely).
- Ensuring the latest secure protocols and cipher suites are used.
- Ensuring proper error handling around the socket operations.
- Validating input data to prevent buffer overflows and other forms of invalid data processing.
- Reviewing the implementation of `doHandshake` and `decryptDatagram` to ensure they correctly handle all possible states and errors.

The code is also still in a minimal state, as indicated by the commit message, so additional security measures would likely need to be implemented as the project matures. Further, this analysis was conducted on an isolated snippet and not on the entire application, where most vulnerabilities often appear due to the interaction between different parts of the code.

For a complete security audit, reviewing the code in context with the whole application and considering its use in a real-world deployment scenario would be essential.
