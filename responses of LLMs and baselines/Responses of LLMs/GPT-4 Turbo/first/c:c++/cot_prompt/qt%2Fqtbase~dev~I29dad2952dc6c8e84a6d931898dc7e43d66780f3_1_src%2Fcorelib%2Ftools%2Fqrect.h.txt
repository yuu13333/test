I'm here to help with the analysis, but without the actual code to review, I can't provide an assessment of security defects. If you can provide some code or specific parts of the code you're concerned about, I can certainly look it over and offer some insights or identify potential security issues. Please paste the code or the part you'd like me to analyze, and I'll get right to it!
