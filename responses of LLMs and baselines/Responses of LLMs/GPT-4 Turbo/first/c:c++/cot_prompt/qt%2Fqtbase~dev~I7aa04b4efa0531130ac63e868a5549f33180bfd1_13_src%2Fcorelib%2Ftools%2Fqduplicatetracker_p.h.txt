After analyzing the original code provided, I found no security defects. The code seems to be related to a memory management optimization rather than dealing directly with user input or other common sources of security vulnerabilities. The `QDuplicateTracker` class provided appears to be an internal part of the Qt toolkit with no direct interaction to interfaces that are accessible from outside, which could otherwise be a conduit for security issues like buffer overflows or injection attacks.

The use of `constexpr` and template-based design also limits runtime manipulation vulnerabilities, as most of the size calculations happen at compile-time. Additionally, the code does appear to use the standard library's memory resource feature (`std::pmr` namespace), which is typically designed to be robust against common memory errors.

However, it should be noted that a comprehensive security audit is a complex process that often requires not just static analysis of the code, but also a dynamic analysis with numerous testing scenarios. Moreover, as with any complex system, future code changes or how this component integrates with other parts could introduce potential security defects that are not visible in this isolated analysis.

Therefore, given the code snippet reviewed and the context provided:
'''No security defects are detected in the code'''.

For any future changes or extensions of this code, it would be prudent to ensure that potential security vulnerabilities are considered, especially if user input is ever involved or if thereâ€™s a change in how memory resources are handled. Best practices in secure coding, regular audits, and adopting a secure development lifecycle are advised.
