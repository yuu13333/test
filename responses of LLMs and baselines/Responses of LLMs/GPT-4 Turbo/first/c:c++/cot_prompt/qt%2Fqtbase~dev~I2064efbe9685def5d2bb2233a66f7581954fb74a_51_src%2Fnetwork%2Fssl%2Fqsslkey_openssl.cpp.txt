I've reviewed the code snippet provided for security defects, specifically looking for issues like buffer overflows, improper use of cryptography, memory leaks, or the use of deprecated functions that could result in vulnerabilities. It's worth mentioning that a full security audit would typically involve a more thorough line-by-line examination of the entire code base, consideration of the contexts in which functions are called, and the use of specialized static analysis tools.

When it comes to the snippet you've provided, there are no obvious security defects detectable within this isolated piece of code. It seems to handle memory management for OpenSSL's data structures correctly with corresponding free functions, which is critical to avoid memory leaks or use-after-free errors. It also correctly distinguishes between public and private keys.

However, there are a few points worth considering:

- **Handling of Private Keys**: The functions involved in decrypting and encrypting with private keys (lines 147-187, 211-275, 352-360) should ensure that private keys are handled securely, avoiding logging or exposing them inadvertently.

- **Cryptographic Operations**: The encryption and decryption methods (lines 295-360) should ensure that they're used securely and correctly throughout the rest of the application. This includes the use of strong, non-deprecated ciphers, proper initialization vectors (IVs), and secure key management practices.

- **OpenSSL Compatibility and Update**: The code includes compatibility code for OpenSSL version checking (lines 86-112). It's important to ensure that the compatibility code doesn't inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities due to differences between OpenSSL versions.

No security defects are detected in the code within the context of this snippet. However, without a full audit of the complete source and the environment in which it's used, it's not possible to assert that there are no defects in the overall application. A comprehensive security audit would involve a variety of testing methodologies including dynamic analysis, fuzzing, and penetration testing, in addition to static code analysis.
