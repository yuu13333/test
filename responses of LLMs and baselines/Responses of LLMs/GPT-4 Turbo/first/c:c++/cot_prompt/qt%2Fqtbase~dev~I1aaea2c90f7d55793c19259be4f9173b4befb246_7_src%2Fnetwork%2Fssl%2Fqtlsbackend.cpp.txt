Without access to the full code or the generated supplementary files, I cannot perform a thorough security analysis. To conduct a detailed security review, source code is required to understand the context and implementation details. If you can provide me with the specific segments of code or more context, then I can assist in identifying potential security issues, if any exist. Otherwise, it is not possible for me to state the security status of the code. If you have the code ready for review, please share it, and I will take a look for you.
