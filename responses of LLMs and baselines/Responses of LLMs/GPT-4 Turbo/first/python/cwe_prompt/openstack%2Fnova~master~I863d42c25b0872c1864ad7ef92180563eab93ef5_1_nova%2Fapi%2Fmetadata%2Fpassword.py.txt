Based on the provided Python code with my understanding of the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), there's an issue related with CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials.

On lines 46-54 in the `convert_password` function, we can see that the password is broken down into chunks and stored as individual metadata items. This method of storing sensitive information may lead to security issues as it is essentially hard-coded credentials, which can be found and exploited by malicious users. Even though it is saved as separate chunks, it is still in plain text format and this does not improve the security, it only obscures it.
  
Solution:
Instead of storing the password as system metadata attributes, consider using secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system or use an external secure storage system such as a hardware security module or a vault-like system.

Additionally, it's recommended to hash and salt the password. Storing hashed and salted passwords is better because when an attacker compromises the password, they only get the hashed and salted version, not the original one. The hashing function makes sure that the output (the hash value) is unique to every unique input, and the added salt makes it much harder for the attacker to use look up tables for attacks. Use a strong, cryptographic hash function such as bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2 or SHA-3.

Please note that this assessment is based on the part of the code that is directly related to the password handling, there might be other potential issues elsewhere in the app related to permissions, authentication, error handling, etc. It's strongly recommended to conduct a thorough security review before production release.
