Overall, the code operates according to expected behavior, maintaining strict resource allocations and keeping good track of changes. However, although not directly a security issue, I noticed a critical defect that in the worst-case scenario, could potentially lead to a denial of service situation. 

The issue is on lines 67 to 81, particularly marked by the `FIXME` comment on line 69. Here, if `finish_resize` fails, the allocations revert, meaning the destination node resource provider does not maintain any allocations - ultimately causing mismatch with the running instance. While this is not traditionally seen as a security issue, it could in some cases lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) situation if the resource allocation system fails to properly allocate resources for critical services leading to service interruption.

Proposed solution:
```
68         source_rp_uuid = self._get_provider_uuid_by_host('host1')
69         dest_rp_uuid = self._get_provider_uuid_by_host('host2')
70         # Keep a copy of original allocation for rollback 
71         original_allocation = self._get_provider_usages(dest_rp_uuid)
72         try:
73             # If there is an exception during resizing, rollback
74             self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation(self.flavor2, server['id'], dest_rp_uuid)
75         except:
76             self._set_provider_usages(dest_rp_uuid, original_allocation)
77             raise 
```
This simple try/except approach will make sure that in case of a potential exception during resizing (or failure of finish resize), the system will revert its allocations to the original state - possibly preventing a DoS scenario by ensuring services are correctly allocated.
