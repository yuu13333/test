After reviewing the provided code thoroughly, I'd say:

'No security defects are detected in the code'.

The code appears to follow good security practices, notably by using existing, well-reviewed libraries for functionality, and not performing any risky operations like dynamic code execution or system-level access. Thus, the code does not seem to include obvious security defects that would be flagged under the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) guidelines. Please note that the conclusion is drawing from the provided code snippet only, and a full application review might result in a different evaluation.   

Remember to follow secure coding standards and use code-reviewing tools for accuracy in large applications. A visual examination of the code, while helpful, is not always 100% efficient at discovering potential security flaws.
