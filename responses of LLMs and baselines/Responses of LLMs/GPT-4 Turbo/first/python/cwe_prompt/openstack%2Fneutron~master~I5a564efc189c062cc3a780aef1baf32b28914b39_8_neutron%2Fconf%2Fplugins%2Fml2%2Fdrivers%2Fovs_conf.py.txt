Upon reviewing the provided code, a potential security defect is identified related to insecure default configurations:

1. **CWE-453: Insecure Default Variable Initialization**
   - At lines 24-25, the DEFAULT_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS and DEFAULT_TUNNEL_TYPES are initialized to empty lists. Although this might not directly be a security vulnerability, using defaults that do not enforce any security mechanism can lead to a system that is not secure by default.
   
   **Solution**: Ensure that the system has secure defaults that encourage or enforce security configurations. Adjust the defaults to values that align with security best practices for the given context.

Moreover, while not a direct security vulnerability, the deprecation warnings at lines 73 and 129 indicate potential future removal of options, which might affect the security if these options are included in the configuration to enforce security aspects (like `prevent_arp_spoofing`).

It's also important to note that security reviews based only on code snippets can be limited. A comprehensive review should include context like how these options are used in practice, the environment in which the software runs, how input is validated, and other code that interacts with these configurations.
