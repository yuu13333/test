Security defects detected: Use of a File for Sensitive Information (CWE-540) and Command Injection (CWE-77).

The `subprocess.call` function is being used to execute commands in two places, with potential injection points from variables interpolated into the command string. Both cases are based on unsanitized input that if maliciously crafted could lead to remote command execution.

Specific lines and remediation suggestions:

1. The function `_ssh_check` (line 111) writes a private key to a temporary file with a fixed name at line 118 and then proceeds to use that file in a shell command constructed by including unsanitized user input (the `namespace` and `ip` variables) into a shell command at lines 122-124.

    Remediation: Instead of writing the key to a file, keep it in memory and use an SSH library that allows for specifying the private key directly. If writing to a file is necessary, ensure that the filename is securely generated to prevent conflicts and potential overwrites, and do not construct shell commands with untrusted input. For example, pass arguments into `subprocess.call` as a list where each argument is clearly specified, or use a library like `paramiko` for SSH which doesn't rely on shell command at all.

2. Before executing the `all_cmd`, it does not appear to validate or sanitize the `namespace` variable, which if maliciously modified could lead to arbitrary command execution. 

    Remediation: Validate and sanitize input used to construct shell commands. Ideally, use Python mechanisms that handle command execution such as `subprocess.Popen` with a list of arguments, avoiding the security risks associated with shell=True.

Additionally, writing sensitive information such as private keys to files, even temporarily, should be avoided when possible to reduce the risk of this information being accessed by unauthorized processes or users. Utilize secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data. 

Please note that static code analysis can uncover potential issues, but a detailed security audit by a specialist may identify other context-specific security risks in the code.
