I've examined the provided code and it appears to be well-structured and follows sound programming practices. However, I found one potential issue that pertains to a security defect, according to CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration).

Line 30: min=-1,
The 'collection_interval's lower limit is set to -1. When this value is used, it might disable metrics collection as per the comment given at line 36. If access to modify this parameter is not properly restricted, it can be manipulated to stop all metrics collection, which is effectively a form of CWE-285: Improper Authorization.

Solution:
It's recommended that you properly secure access so that only authorized entities can modify the 'collection_interval' parameter. Also, adding additional validation to ensure that the value won't be abused would be beneficial. For example, you might consider setting a reasonable minimum value if metrics must be collected at all times to prevent service disruption. 

Let me know if you need more help.
