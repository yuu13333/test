I have reviewed the provided code in depth. It appears that no clear security defects were found in your code according to the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standard. The logic looks good and it contains good quality testing code. It is well-written and follows good software engineering principles.

However, it's also important to highlight that while there may not be explicit CWEs, it's still necessary to ensure associated functions, methods and classes are secure and handle user input correctly to prevent security issues such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and so on. The security of your code may depend on how certain methods (like `_boot_and_check_allocations`, `_start_compute`) are implemented.

It's worth noting that ensuring a piece of code is secure is an ongoing, iterative process and should involve additional security measures like periodic code reviews, penetration testing, and utilizing security monitoring tools.
