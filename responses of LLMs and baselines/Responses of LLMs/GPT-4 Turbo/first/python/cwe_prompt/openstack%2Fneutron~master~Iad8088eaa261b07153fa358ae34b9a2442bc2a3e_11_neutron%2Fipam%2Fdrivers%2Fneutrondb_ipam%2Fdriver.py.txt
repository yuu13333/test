After reviewing the provided code against the CWE, a potential security defect has been identified:

### Insufficient Randomness (CWE-330)

#### Description
The use of Python's `random` module for allocating IP addresses can lead to predictability in IP address allocation, as the `random` module is not cryptographically strong.

#### Affected Code
Lines 182-188: The window size for the allocation of IP addresses is determined using the `random` module.

Lines 199: The `random.sample` function is used to select IP addresses from the available set which might not be sufficiently random for security-sensitive operations.

#### Solution
Replace the `random` module with the `os.urandom` function or the `secrets` module (which is designed for cryptographic purposes) to generate a random selection of IP addresses. This will ensure that the IP address allocation process is not predictable.

For example, lines 199 could be modified to use the `secrets` module as follows:

```python
import secrets  # Add this import at the beginning of the file

...

# Use secrets.choice for cryptographically strong random selection
allocated_ip_pool = [secrets.choice(av_ips) for _ in range(num_addresses)]
```

The rest of the code does not appear to have any other security issues directly related to the CWE categories. However, security is context-dependent, and a full audit by a security professional is recommended for a comprehensive analysis.
