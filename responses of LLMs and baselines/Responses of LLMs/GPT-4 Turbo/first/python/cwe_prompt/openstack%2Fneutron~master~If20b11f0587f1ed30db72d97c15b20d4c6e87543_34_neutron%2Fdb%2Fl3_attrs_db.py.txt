After a thorough review of the provided code, a potential security defect is detected at line 80. The security defect is related to CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message.

Description of the defect:
Line 80 raises a RuntimeError that includes the key input from users in its error message. This could potentially expose sensitive data, if the key contains any, to unauthorized individuals.

Solution: 
To mitigate this potential issue, consider modifying the error message to omit the direct user input. Inspect the value of the key for sensitive information before including in the error message, or simply omit it. Here's a adjusted version of line 80:

```python
raise RuntimeError(_("Tried to set a key in the extra attributes table which doesn't exist."))
```

Remember that error messages should provide enough context to correct the issue, but also should not provide potential attackers with additional information about system internals or sensitive data.
