The code seems generally to adhere to good security practices, but there's one potential issue that I noticed.
The utils.execute() function is used in several places within this code (lines 112, 122, 145, and 152) which will run a system command. The use of this function can be problematic if not handled correctly.
In particular, both the arguments passed to mount (line 117) and mkdir (line 112), umount (line 145), and rmdir (line 152), come from the variable mountpoint and vol_name which could be supplied by the user. If these are not thoroughly cleaned, it could be a potential point of a security risk (like OS command injection) depending upon where input comes (recall all input is evil).
It can be mitigated by strong sanitization and validation.
One another thing is, on line 154, you are logging an error message using the third-party input: six.text_type(ex). Care should be taken while logging errors. If the third-party input is malicious, it may have some impacts.
In general, you need to consider sanitizing and properly validating all user-supplied input to ensure that it is safe before using it in a functional context to mitigate these potential security vulnerabilities.
