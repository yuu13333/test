While analyzing this Python code from start to finish, I can say that there is one potential security defect that you should pay attention to. It can be seen in the section where the program opens a file for reading at line 112.
112: dummy_str = str_encode_hex(open(copy_file.src, 'r').read())
The issue here is that if the file doesn’t exist or can’t be opened for some reason, an IOError will be raised and potentially crash the program. Furthermore, if copy_file.src is user-defined input, opening it without any validation allows for potential arbitrary file read vulnerabilities. A user may manipulate the input in such a way that they could read any file the running program has access to.
To fix this, you should always ensure that the file you're trying to open actually exists and throw an exception if it doesn't. You should ideally follow the principle of least privilege, meaning only give the necessary privileges and nothing more.
Here is how you can resolve it:
try:
    with open(copy_file.src, 'r') as file:
        dummy_str = str_encode_hex(file.read())
except IOError:
    logging.error('File not accessible')
    return
except Exception as e:
    logging.error('An unexpected error occurred while reading the file: ' + str(e))
    return
By utilizing this updated block of code, you will be effectively checking the existence of the file before trying to open it, and also handling potential errors in a graceful manner rather than allowing the entire program to crash. Furthermore, you'd want to validate the user-defined input to ensure they can't read files they're not supposed to be able to access. You may set up a whitelist for approved files or sanitize the input to prevent directory traversal attacks. Other parts of the code seem to handle security adequately.
