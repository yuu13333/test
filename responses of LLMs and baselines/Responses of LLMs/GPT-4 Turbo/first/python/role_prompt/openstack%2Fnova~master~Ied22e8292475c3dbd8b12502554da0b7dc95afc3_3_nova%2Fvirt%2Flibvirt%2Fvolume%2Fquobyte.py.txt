Upon reviewing your Nova's OpenStack code, I identified a potential security vulnerability:
On line 48, the code checks for the existence of a system file using a hardcoded string as the file path. It's better not to hardcode system-specific values like file paths because they can vary in different environments.
The problem isn't just system portability but also a security concern. If an attacker manages to create a "/run/systemd/system" in a different directory that your program has access to, your program could mistakenly use the attacker's crafted file.
A better way would be to get the environment-specific directories dynamically using proper package or environment variables, making it harder for an attacker to trick your program into using the wrong file.
Here's a possible solution, replace line 48:

if os.path.exists("/run/systemd/system"):

with:

if os.path.exists(os.path.join(os.getenv('RUNTIME_DIR', '/run'), 'systemd', 'system')):

This allows a fallback to '/run' if the 'RUNTIME_DIR' environment variable is not set. The same needs to be done wherever a hardcoded path is present in the code.
The rest of the code seems fine with no other apparent security issues. It uses try/except blocks where needed, takes care of unmounting correctly and checks paths adequately. And it nicely encapsulates commands. Good job!
