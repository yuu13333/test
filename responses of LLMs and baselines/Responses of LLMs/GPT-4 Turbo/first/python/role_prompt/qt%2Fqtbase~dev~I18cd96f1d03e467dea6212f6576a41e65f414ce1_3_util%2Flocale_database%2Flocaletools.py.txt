After going through the given code, I can say '''No security defects are detected in the code'''.
However, as a general note, I would advise keeping a strong emphasis on input validation in any other functionality that may interact with this code. This could mitigate potential security weaknesses such as code injection or exploiting data that is being written to or read from the filesystem.
