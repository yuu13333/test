After thoroughly reviewing the provided code, one potential security defect that I detected is related to the handling of SSH private keys. 

On line 124, a private key is written to a predictable file location "/tmp/testkey.dat". 

This opens a potential security risk as any user on the system could potentially read this file. The risk is increased by the fact that the file isn't immediately deleted after usage. Instead, it is deleted after a number of retries, which could be too late if an attacker gains access in the meantime.

Here's the recommended solution: 

- You should use the Python "tempfile" module to create a temporary file securely. This guarantees that the file is unique and is immediately deleted after closing.

Corrected code:

```python
import tempfile

#----- Your code ------

def _ssh_check(self, username, ip, namespace, private_key, retries=10):
    ret = 1
    ssh_commands = 'ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ' \
                   'StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ConnectTimeout=10 ' \
                   '-i %s %s@%s id'

    all_cmd = ''

    # Use the tempfile module to securely create a temporary file
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as temp:
        temp.write(private_key)
        temp.flush()  # Make sure the data is written to disk
        temp.seek(0)  # Go back to the beginning of the file

        # Now, use the temp file
        ssh_commands = ssh_commands % (temp.name, username, ip)

        all_cmd = 'sudo ip net exec %s %s' % (namespace, ssh_commands)

        for i in range(0, retries):
            ret = subprocess.call(all_cmd, shell=True,
                                  stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                                  stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
            if ret == 0:
                break
            time.sleep(3)

    self.assertEqual(0, ret, 'instance is down')
```

With this change, the temporary file is securely created and instantly deleted after it has been closed. The security concern associated with the potential reading of the SSH key by other users on the system is mitigated.
