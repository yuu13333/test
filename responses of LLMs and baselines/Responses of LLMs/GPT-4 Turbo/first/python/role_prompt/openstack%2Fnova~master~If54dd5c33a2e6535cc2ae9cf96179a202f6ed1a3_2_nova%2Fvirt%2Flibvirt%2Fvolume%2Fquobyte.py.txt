The code provided for review doesn't appear to have any glaring security defects. However, there is a practice that merits some attention from a security perspective.
This concerns the handling of the process execution in lines 62-68. In these lines, the code is executing a command (systemctl is-system-running) and parsing stdout to determine a state. This opens up room for potential Process Injection attacks in the event an attacker can manipulate the behavior or output of the 'systemctl is-system-running' command to fit one of the VALID_SYSD_STATES.
Though this vulnerability may seem far-fetched given that it requires an attacker with the capacity to alter your system's systemctl output, it's always a good practice to sanitize, validate, and limit command execution in your code.
Suggestion: Review if the usage of process execution in your code is adequately protected, properly sanitized, and limited. Determine if there's a way to avoid process execution altogether.
Despite this, given the information you've shared with me, I can't determine if this code is vulnerable or not. Always consider multiple lines of defense such as least privilege principal, validation and sanitation when developing software.Please note that while code reviews can catch some security defects, not all will be caught in a simple review. A vulnerability assessment or penetration test would provide a more comprehensive view of the code security.
