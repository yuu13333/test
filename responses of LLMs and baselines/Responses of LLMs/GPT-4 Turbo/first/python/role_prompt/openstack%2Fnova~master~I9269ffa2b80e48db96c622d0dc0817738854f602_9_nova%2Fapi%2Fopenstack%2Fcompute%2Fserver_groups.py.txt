Upon reviewing this code, no major security issues were detected as it utilizes typical security measures such as instance and context verifications. However, I noticed a potential security lapse that could be exploited if not addressed properly. The potential issue is that an attacker could potentially use a brute-force or other type of attack with the function show beginning from line 74 and delete beginning from line 84, as there is no rate limiting or authentications surrounding these functions. An attacker could, theoretically, continue trying an unlimited amount of 'id's to obtain sensitive information or delete server groups.
My recommendation would be to incorporate a form of rate limiting or other security measure(s) that serve to mitigate such types of attacks. For example, you might consider the "429 Too Many Requests" status code, or some other form of request rate limiting to prevent potential brute-forcing attacks.
But overall, I would say, '''No significant security defects are detected in the code'''.
