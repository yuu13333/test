This code seems to be quite robust against security defects. The script carefully uses privilege separation (through the use of HAProxy running as a different user) and secure programming practices, such as careful exception handling, to minimize the attack surface.
However, there is one potential security concern I'd like to note:
The server is bound to all available network interfaces (Line 51: bind 0.0.0.0:%(port)s). This means the server is openly accessible from all network interfaces of the machine, including potentially insecure or publicly accessible ones. Depending on the specific setup of your infrastructure, you might want to consider binding the server to localhost (127.0.0.1) or a secure, internal network interface only.
A proposed fix could simply be a matter of replacing 0.0.0.0 with 127.0.0.1 or a particular network interface address, but this largely depends on the specific needs of your infrastructure.
Remember, all code should be tested before going to production, especially if that code is serving in security-critical roles like this one is. This review's depth is also somewhat limited by the fact that I cannot see the specific functions being called by the script, and there is a possibility that security vulnerabilities exist in there.
