After reviewing the provided code, I found no obvious security defects in the code. It correctly mounts and unmounts volumes using privilege escalation when necessary (with `run_as_root=True`), and it checks for mount validity and permissions.

However, an in-depth security audit by a security professional is recommended, as they could perform more extensive checks, such as ensuring that all external inputs (such as the `volume` variable) are properly sanitized to prevent command injection and that error handling does not expose system information unnecessarily which could be an information disclosure vulnerability. Additionally, the code assumes that `systemd-run` is not vulnerable and relies on it for process isolation which should be verified as part of system security best practices.

'''No security defects are detected in the code'''.
