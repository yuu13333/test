No security defects are detected in the code.

Please note that a thorough security review generally involves a more in-depth analysis than just reading through the code. This code does interact with a database and manages quotas, so it's important to ensure that proper access control and input validation are in place to prevent issues like SQL injection or unauthorized access. However, based on the given code snippet alone, without understanding the entire context and without performing dynamic analysis, it is not possible to assert the complete absence of security defects.
