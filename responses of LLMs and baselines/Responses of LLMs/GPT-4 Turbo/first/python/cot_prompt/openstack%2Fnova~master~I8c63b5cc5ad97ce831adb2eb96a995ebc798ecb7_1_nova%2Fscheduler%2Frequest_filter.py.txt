After analyzing the provided code, I can state: '''No security defects are detected in the code'''.

However, it is important to note that a thorough security audit typically involves more than a mere review of a small code snippet. Such audits need to look at the entire system, including how the code interacts with other components, how data is input and output, and the overall logic and flow of the application. For a comprehensive security review, static and dynamic analysis tools, along with manual code review by security experts, are generally employed. Additionally, the context in which this code is executed plays a significant role in the security posture of the system, including how access controls, authentication, and encryption are handled.
