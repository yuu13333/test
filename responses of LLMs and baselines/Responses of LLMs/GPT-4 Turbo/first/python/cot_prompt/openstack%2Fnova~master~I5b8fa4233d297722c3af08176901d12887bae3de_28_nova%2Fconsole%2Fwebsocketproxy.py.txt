Based on a review of the provided code snippet, no overt security defects are detected in the code. However, without the entire context of the application and how it's deployed, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive security analysis. The changes outlined in the commit message seem to be geared towards improving security by masking access tokens within the logs, which is a procedural improvement.

To further enhance security, you might consider the following best practices, although these do not directly point to defects in the provided snippet:

1. Ensure proper error handling is consistently applied to avoid revealing sensitive system information, especially when raising exceptions based on the parsing of user input (e.g., `origin_hostname` or `token`).

2. Confirm that adequate logging is in place for monitoring and detecting potential misuse or anomalous behavior, without revealing sensitive information like tokens, even in a masked form.

3. Verify the input validation for all incoming data to prevent potential injection attacks or malformed request exploitation.

4. Always use the latest version of dependencies and libraries to incorporate recent security patches, and adhere to the best coding practices such as regular code reviews and static code analyses that could reveal indirect defects.

5. Implement robust authentication and authorization checks where necessary to ensure only privileged users can access certain functions.

As mentioned, these are not direct defect identifications but considerations to potentially fortify the security of the code.
