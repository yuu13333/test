No security defects are detected in the code. 

Please note that without the ability to perform a complete and dynamic code analysis, which usually includes running an automated security scanning tool, performing dependency checks, and potentially a manual code review, it is not possible to guarantee with absolute certainty that there are no security defects in the code provided.

Security reviews often take into account not only the static code but also the context in which the code operates, including configurations, the broader infrastructure, and potentially sensitive data handling practices. The code provided would need to be considered within the full application and infrastructure to conduct a thorough security assessment.
