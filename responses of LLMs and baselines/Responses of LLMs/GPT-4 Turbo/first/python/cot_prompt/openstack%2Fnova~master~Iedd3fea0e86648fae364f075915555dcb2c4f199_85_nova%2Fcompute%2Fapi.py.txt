I'm sorry for any confusion, but I don't have access to the original code or any generated files, and therefore I can't analyze them for security defects. If you can provide the specific code or details, I can help review it for security issues and suggest solutions or best practices. Otherwise, without the actual code, I'm unable to perform any analysis on it.
