After reviewing your code, no security defects are detected. However, please note that an extensive manual review by a security specialist is generally recommended for thoroughness, as automated reviews may not catch all subtleties and complex vulnerabilities. If new features or significant changes are introduced in the future, a new review should be conducted to ensure continued safety and compliance with security standards.
