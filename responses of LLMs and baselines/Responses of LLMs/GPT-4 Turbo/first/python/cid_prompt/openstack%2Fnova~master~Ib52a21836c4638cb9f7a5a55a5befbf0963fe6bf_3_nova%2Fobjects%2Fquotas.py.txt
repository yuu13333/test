Upon analyzing the provided code snippet, it appears one potential issue related to access control (CWE-284) could be present. Specifically:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
   The `ids_from_instance` function defined at line 24 checks if the calling user has admin privileges (line 25) and then, without further access checks, potentially assigns the project_id and user_id from the instance regardless of the actual ownership (lines 27 and 31). 

   This could allow an admin user to access or manipulate quota information for a project or user other than their own without proper authorization checks being performed.

   Solution:
   Additional checks should be implemented to validate whether the admin user is indeed authorized to access or modify the quota information for the given project or user ID. This may involve checking against an Access Control List (ACL) or implementing a domain-level authorization model to ensure only authorized admins can perform such actions.

No other specific CWE match from the provided list seems to be present without deeper context regarding the usage of this code in the larger application and without knowing the implementation of the imported modules (which could contain further security mechanisms or exacerbate these issues). Nonetheless, it's important to analyze the use of the `nova` module's `db` and `quota` methods to ensure they handle transactions securely and don't introduce resource control issues (CWE-664).

The other considerations like error handling (CWE-703), incorrect calculation (CWE-682), insufficient control flow (CWE-691), improper interaction between multiple entities (CWE-435), and the rest of the CWEs listed are either handled correctly or require more context to review thoroughly.

Please note that while this analysis suggests a potential security issue, thorough testing and review within the full application context are recommended to confirm any vulnerabilities.
