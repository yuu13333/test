After reviewing the provided code, a few potential security defects have been identified:

1. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
   - Line 75: `obj.stdin.close()` closes the standard input immediately after communicating with the process. It can lead to unexpected behavior if the subprocess is not done using the stdin.

   Solution: Ensure that stdin is closed only after the subprocess indicates it no longer needs it, for example, by checking if the process has terminated or no longer requires input.

2. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
   - Line 50 (`preexec_fn=None`): Although currently not set to anything, if `preexec_fn` were to be used in the future, this could lead to potential vulnerabilities where the pre-execution function in a subprocess can change the privileges of that process.

   Solution: Avoid using `preexec_fn` or ensure it does not contain code that might lower the security of the process being run.

3. CWE-78 (OS Command Injection):
   - Line 129: `execute(['cmd', '/S', '/C', 'tasklist | findstr %s' % pid])` uses string interpolation to compose a command, which might make it possible to inject additional commands if `pid` is not properly sanitized.

   Solution: Properly sanitize and validate `pid` to ensure it does not contain any characters that could lead to command injection. In this case, consider using a list to pass the pid as an argument to avoid shell interpretation.

4. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
   - Line 129 as mentioned above can also relate to improper neutralization because string interpolation is used to insert `pid` into a command. If `pid` contains shell metacharacters or other harmful elements, it could affect the behavior of the command in unpredictable ways.

   Solution: As suggested above, ensure strict type checking and sanitization on any external input (like `pid`) used in command execution.

Please note that these are potential defects, and the actual security implications may vary based on how the code is being used and what the rest of the codebase looks like. Additional context, such as where inputs to these functions come from and how they're generated, would be necessary to provide a more conclusive security assessment.
