After carefully reviewing the provided code, I found no security defects. No issues related to the mentioned CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration) were detected in the code. The functions and controls seem to be properly implemented without apparent incorrect resource handling, improper access control, or insufficient control flow management.

However, it is important to note that this kind of static analysis is not exhaustive, and full security assurance would require a comprehensive analysis including but not limited to dynamic analysis, architectural review, and potentially full codebase context consideration.

For the best security practice, ensure that actual penetration testing, dynamic analysis, and other security assessments are performed on the environment where this code will be executed, alongside the integration with other system components.
