After reviewing the provided code snippet, I did not detect any security defects in relation to the provided CWE defect types (CWE-284, CWE-435, CWE-664, CWE-682, CWE-691, CWE-693, CWE-697, CWE-703, CWE-707, CWE-710). 

The code appears to follow good security practices, including proper handling of signals, use of threading events for clean shutdown, usage of a Unix domain socket for inter-process communication, and controlled logging. It leverages existing libraries for network and configuration functions, which, if they are up-to-date, should minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities.

However, security analysis can be context-sensitive and might require information about the deployment environment, dependency versions, and a deeper understanding of how this code interacts with other system components. It's possible that some issues are not evident without a full understanding of the surrounding architecture or without additional runtime information. Security reviews should always be performed in depth and in context.

Therefore, given the information provided, no security defects are detected in the code.
