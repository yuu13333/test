After reviewing the code provided, I found several potential security defects:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
It seems that `_custom_getter` in lines 36-39 bypasses normal plugin access to retrieve a resource directly. If quotas are sensitive, this might be an access control issue because the code doesn't perform any explicit authorization checks before fetching them.

2. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
In the `PolicyHook.before` method, lines 141-157 try to enforce policies on various resources. If the enforcement fails (`oslo_policy.PolicyNotAuthorized`), a 403 or 404 error is raised depending on whether the tenant is modifying its object. There might be insufficient control flow management regarding how the policy enforcement results govern the program's flow, potentially leading to unforeseen behaviors.

3. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
In the `PolicyHook.after` method, from line 170 through 207, the code modifies the response based on policy checks, which may lead to improper data being sent back if there is an exception in these checks. There is a risk of leaking information if the policy checks arenâ€™t robust.

4. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
The code catches `oslo_policy.PolicyNotAuthorized` and `oslo_policy.InvalidScope` exceptions but does not seem to cover other possible exceptions that could occur during policy enforcement. Therefore, unexpected exceptions might not be handled correctly, which could disrupt the normal flow and possibly result in partial information disclosure or denial of service.

Solutions:
- A thorough access control policy needs to be enforced in `_custom_getter` to ensure that the function can't be used to bypass any intended access restrictions.
- For the control flow management issue, ensure that all paths resulting from policy enforcement are correctly handled and lead to safe and understood outcomes, avoiding unintended data leaks or access.
- Ensure that the neutralization of policy enforcement errors is handled cleanly and doesn't unintentionally expose sensitive information.
- A broader exception handling strategy may need to be implemented to catch and handle all expected types of exceptions during policy enforcement, ensuring that any error is managed in a way that doesn't compromise the security or availability of the service.
