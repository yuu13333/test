After reviewing the provided code, there are a couple of potential security concerns worth noting:

1. **Potential Security Concerns with Context Authorization:**
   - The code from lines 24-34 defines a function `ids_from_instance` that retrieves and possibly switches the project ID and user ID based on the provided context and instance. If an administrator is acting in a different context (e.g., managing resources not owned by them), this could potentially lead to unauthorized data access or operations if not handled correctly within the context of the whole application. This is particularly crucial if the application lacks robust authorization checks elsewhere.
   - To mitigate this, ensure that any role-based access control (RBAC) or other security mechanisms properly validate the user's permissions against the modified IDs, especially when administrative privileges allow access across different projects or user spaces.

2. **Data Leakage Through Exceptions (Line 186-191):**
   - The exception handling in the method `check_deltas` (lines 186-191) augments the exception with usage details before re-raising it. This inclusion of potentially sensitive information (e.g., usage counts) in exception messages could lead to data leakage if these exceptions are logged or displayed inappropriately.
   - It's advisable to review how exceptions are handled throughout the application to ensure sensitive data isn't exposed through logs or error messages to unauthorized users or external systems.

While the specific implementation details of the entire application are not available from the provided snippet, the concerns listed above are based on common best practices for handling user contexts and data exposure in exceptions. Each potential issue should be validated and addressed in the context of the entire application's security posture. If the overall system implements comprehensive access controls and secure handling of exceptions, these concerns may already be mitigated.
