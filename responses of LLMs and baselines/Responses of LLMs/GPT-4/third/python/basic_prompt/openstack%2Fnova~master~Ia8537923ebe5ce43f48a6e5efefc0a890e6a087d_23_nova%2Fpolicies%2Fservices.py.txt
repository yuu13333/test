No security defects are detected in the code provided.

The code appears to handle security-related aspects appropriately by defining policies using the `oslo_policy` library for access control in a Nova (OpenStack Compute service) context. It employs role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms that differentiate access between system-level administrators and readers through `SYSTEM_ADMIN` and `SYSTEM_READER` roles, respectively. The policies manage access to operations like listing, updating, and deleting compute services. Moreover, the code mentions deprecating older policies in favor of newer ones with better security practices, which indicates a forward-thinking approach to security enhancements.

The only consideration to note, which is not strictly a defect, is to ensure that the deprecation and migration to new policies are managed smoothly to avoid any temporary gaps in security policy enforcement. This would mainly concern the deployment and configuration settings in `nova.conf`, as mentioned in the comments, but does not directly affect the security of the code itself as written.
