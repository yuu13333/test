After reviewing the provided code, I found one potential security defect related to the handling of the VRRP authentication password.

**Security Defect:**
The configuration option for the VRRP authentication password (`ha_vrrp_auth_password`) is designed to be secured by marking the configuration option as `secret` at line 44. However, there is a potential security risk if the application does not enforce restrictions on who can view or modify the configuration files or if it logs configuration details at any point, including during errors or debugging sessions.

**Detailed Explanation:**
If the configuration files are exposed or if verbose logging is enabled without properly sanitizing logs, sensitive information like the VRRP authentication password might be leaked. This can happen if the password is included in log messages or if an error that exposes configuration values is triggered.

**Solution:**
To mitigate this risk, you should ensure that:
1. Configuration files containing sensitive information are properly secured with the appropriate file system permissions.
2. Logging mechanisms are designed to sanitize or exclude sensitive information from logs, especially in debug or error outputs.
3. Regular audits and access controls are enforced to ensure that only authorized users can view or modify the configuration files.

**Recommendation:**
Implement additional checks within the application to ensure that the logs do not contain sensitive information and that proper access control mechanisms are in place for viewing or modifying configuration files. You might also consider encrypting sensitive configuration values to add an extra layer of security.
