Upon reviewing the provided code, a few potential security concerns can be identified. Here are the issues along with their suggested solutions:

1. **Command Injection Risk (Line 129):** The function `process_is_running` directly interpolates the PID into a command string, which could potentially be exploited if the PID variable is influenced by user input. This can be mitigated by using parameterized commands or proper validation and escaping of the input.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that `pid` is strictly a number. This can be enforced by casting `pid` to an integer (`int(pid)`) before including it in the command. Additionally, it's safer to avoid string interpolation for commands altogether.

2. **Uncontrolled Logging of Sensitive Information (Lines 39, 91, 93):** The commands and their outputs, including potentially sensitive information, are logged. If the logs are not properly secured, this information could be exposed to unauthorized parties.
   - **Solution:** Consider filtering or obfuscating sensitive information before logging. Additionally, implement access controls to ensure that logs are only accessible by authorized personnel.

3. **Use of Environment Variables (Lines 40, 43):** The use of environment variables to pass additional settings (`env.update(addl_env)`) to subprocesses might inadvertently expose sensitive information if not handled securely.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that the environment variables being updated or added do not contain sensitive information. If sensitive information must be passed, use a more secure method than environment variables, such as secure storage mechanisms.

4. **Lack of Secure Default in subprocess.Popen (Lines 45-51):** The use of `close_fds=False` in `subprocess.Popen` might lead to file descriptor leaks, especially in a multi-threaded environment which can lead to information leakage across processes.
   - **Solution:** Set `close_fds=True` to ensure that all file descriptors except standard input, output, and error are closed before the child process is executed.

Implementing these changes will help in improving the security posture of the code by mitigating potential risks associated with command injection, information leakage, and insecure subprocess handling.
