The code you provided for the initialization of a WSGI application for Nova APIs, which is a part of the OpenStack project, contains a security defect related to the handling of environment variables and file paths:

### Security Defect
- **Security Defect**: Insecure handling of environment variables and file path construction
- **Location**: Lines 34-39
- **Description**: The function `_get_config_files` constructs file paths for configuration files using a directory path that it retrieves from an environment variable (`OS_NOVA_CONFIG_DIR`). This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the environment variable to point to a malicious or unintended directory, potentially causing the application to read a tampered configuration file.
- **Solution**: The application should validate the directory path to ensure it's within a safe, expected range or predefined safe directories. Additionally, it could check that the directory path is not a symbolic link, particularly in sensitive environments, to prevent directory traversal or symbolic link attacks. 

### Suggested Code Correction
Here is an improved version of the `_get_config_files` function:

```python
import os

def _get_config_files(env=None):
    if env is None:
        env = os.environ
    dirname = env.get('OS_NOVA_CONFIG_DIR', '/etc/nova').strip()
    
    # Ensure the directory is within a predefined list of safe directories
    if dirname not in ['/etc/nova', '/usr/local/etc/nova']:
        raise ValueError("Invalid configuration directory.")

    # Optionally, add checks to ensure 'dirname' is not a symbolic link
    if os.path.islink(dirname):
        raise ValueError("Configuration directory cannot be a symbolic link.")

    return [os.path.join(dirname, config_file) for config_file in CONFIG_FILES]
```

By incorporating these checks, the application mitigates risks associated with external influence over configuration file directories. Additionally, explicitly specifying and checking against a list of allowed directories can further restrict the potential for exploitation.
