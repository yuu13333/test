After reviewing the code, here is a summary of a potential security defect identified along with the suggested resolution:

### Potential Security Issue

**Issue:**
- **Information Exposure through an Error Message**: The error messages returned on validation failures (lines 156 and 170) expose exception details directly to the client, which can include sensitive information about the internal state or logic of the application. Such information might be useful for attackers to understand more about the backend system or to refine further attacks.

**Location:**
- Lines 156 and 170

**Risk:**
- The detailed information in the exceptions could potentially help an attacker gain insights into the backend systems, configurations, or possibly the data structures used within the application.

**Resolution:**
- To mitigate this issue, it's recommended to log the detailed exceptions internally for debugging purposes but only send generic, non-descriptive error messages to the client. For example:
  ```python
  # Instead of returning specific exception details in the HTTP response:
  raise webob.exc.HTTPBadRequest(
      _('Invalid query string parameters: %(exc)s') % {'exc': exc}
  )

  # Log the error internally and return a generic message:
  LOG.error('Invalid query string parameters: %s', exc)
  raise webob.exc.HTTPBadRequest(_('Invalid query string parameters.'))
  ```

  And similarly for the `ResourceClassNotFound` exception:
  ```python
  LOG.error('Invalid resource class in resources parameter: %s', exc)
  raise webob.exc.HTTPBadRequest(_('Invalid resource class in resources parameter.'))
  ```

This change ensures that while the system retains detailed logs for administrative or debugging purposes, potential attackers are not provided with information that could facilitate further attacks.
