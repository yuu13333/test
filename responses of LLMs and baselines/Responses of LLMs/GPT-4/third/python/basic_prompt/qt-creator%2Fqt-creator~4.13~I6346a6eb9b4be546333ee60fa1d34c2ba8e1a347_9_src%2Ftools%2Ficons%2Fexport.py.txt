The provided Python script includes a couple of areas that could potentially introduce security defects:

1. **Shell Command Injection** (Lines 101-120):
   - The use of `subprocess.Popen` with `--shell` option in `exportPngs` function (Line 102) can be risky, especially because the `inkscape` command is constructed using unsanitized user input from `svgIDs`, `svgFile`, and potentially the `scaleFactors`. While the script does not directly include user interaction for generating `svgIDs` or `svgFile`, their composition from external input could be manipulated.
   - The specific issue arises because external input (`args.filter` used in `svgIDs` function to match SVG element IDs) indirectly influences the commands sent to the shell. If an SVG ID contained shell metacharacters or was crafted maliciously, it might lead to arbitrary command execution.

2. **Improper Path Sanitization** (Throughout the script):
   - The function `qtcRoot` (Lines 43-47) dynamically determines the application's root directory based on environmental variables or relative paths. This calculation might allow a path traversal attack if an attacker can influence the `QTC_SRC` environment variable or manipulate the filesystem structure relative to the script.
   - Although the script calculates paths and uses them to check file existence (e.g., Line 82) and for command execution (e.g., Lines 131-133 in `optimizePngs`), the reliance on relative and potentially manipulatable paths can be problematic, especially in environments where the script's integrity isn't strictly controlled.

**Solutions**:
- For **Shell Command Injection**:
  - Avoid using `--shell` option in `subprocess.Popen` and instead execute each command directly without passing it through a shell interface.
  - Sanitize or validate all inputs that form a part of a command-line argument to ensure they do not contain unexpected characters that could lead to command injection.
  - Consider using more secure APIs like `subprocess.run()` with a list of command arguments to further reduce risks.

- For **Improper Path Sanitization**:
  - Validate and sanitize the `QTC_SRC` environment variable and any paths derived from user input or external influences.
  - Use absolute paths where possible and check for path traversal patterns like `../`.
  - Restrict file operations to a specific trusted directory, possibly through configuration or by enforcing stricter permission checks.

By addressing these potential vulnerabilities, the script would be more secure against common attack vectors like command injection and unauthorized file access.
