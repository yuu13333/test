The code you've shared appears well-structured and contains several measures to handle data validation and error checking. However, there is one potential security issue that stands out:

### Security Defect: Insecure Function for Converting Strings to Boolean
The function `strutils.bool_from_string` used in line 115 converts a string to a boolean. This utility function, if not strictly handled, may lead to unexpected results based on input, especially if the input can be controlled by an external user. An input that is not exactly 'true' or 'false' (considering different cases and internationalized inputs) might be misinterpreted, potentially leading to incorrect processing logic or unintended behavior in the application.

#### Solution:
1. Ensure that all user inputs that are converted using `strutils.bool_from_string` are validated against a strict set of allowable values before conversion.
2. Alternatively, consider updating the utility function to handle unexpected or malformed inputs more securely, possibly by raising an exception or defaulting to a safe value when the input is ambiguous.

This issue is relatively minor if the inputs to the function are controlled internally or validated properly before being used. However, it's important to ensure that external inputs are handled securely to maintain the robustness of the application's logic.
