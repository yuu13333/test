After reviewing the code provided, I identified a potential security defect related to threading and concurrency due to the use of green threads with eventlet, particularly around the throttling logic:

**Potential Security Defect: Threading Issue**
- **Location**: Line 100
- **Description**: The code assumes the usage of green threads (eventlet) to manage concurrency. In the `__call__` method of the `throttler` class, there's a comment suggesting the need for a locking mechanism if greenthreads are not used anymore (lines 98-99). Without proper synchronization, there is a risk of race conditions where multiple threads might incorrectly modify shared data (`self._last_time_called`) simultaneously. This could lead to inconsistent states and behaviors in a multi-threaded environment, potentially resulting in unintended high rates of function execution which the throttler is designed to prevent.
- **Solution**: Implement a proper locking mechanism, such as using `threading.Lock` in Python. This would ensure that the section of the code checking and modifying the time of the last call (`self._last_time_called`) is executed by only one thread at a time. You can wrap the update of `self._last_time_called` and the check for time since the last call within a lock context. Here's an example of how you might introduce a lock:

  ```python
  import threading

  class throttler(object):
      def __init__(self, func):
          self._threshold = DEFAULT_THROTTLER_VALUE
          self._last_time_called = time.time() - self.throttle_threshold
          self._func = func
          self._lock = threading.Lock()  # Lock instance to synchronize access

      def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
          with self._lock:  # Use the lock to prevent race conditions
              time_since_last_call = time.time() - self._last_time_called
              if time_since_last_call < self.throttle_threshold:
                  self.sleep()
                  self._last_time_called = time.time()
                  return self._func(*args, **kwargs)
              else:
                  self._last_time_called = time.time()
                  return self._func(*args, **kwargs)
  ```

This solution ensures that when threads attempt to modify or check the last call time, they must acquire the lock, preventing simultaneous access that could lead to race conditions and inconsistent throttling behavior.
