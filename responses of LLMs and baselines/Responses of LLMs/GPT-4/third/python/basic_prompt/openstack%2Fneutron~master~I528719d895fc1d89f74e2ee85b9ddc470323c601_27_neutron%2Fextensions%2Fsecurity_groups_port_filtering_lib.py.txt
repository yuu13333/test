No security defects are detected in the code.

The code provided does not contain any active functionality that could lead to security defects. It primarily defines constants and settings for a software extension, including its alias, description, and metadata about its attributes and requirements. There are no executable statements or manipulations of external inputs that could introduce security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, buffer overflow, etc.

The code mainly sets up metadata and configurations for a software extension in a development environment, hence no operations present security risks.
