After reviewing the provided code, I found one potential security defect related to the use of temporary files:

**Security Defect: Insecure use of a temporary file**
- **Line Number**: 39
- **Description**: The `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` is used to create a temporary file to store configuration details (line 39). This temporary file is written to with potentially sensitive configuration data, which could include paths or other server configurations (lines 40-41). The use of temporary files for storing configuration or sensitive information can pose a security risk, primarily because of the potential for symlink attacks or unauthorized access to the content of the file.
- **Solution**: To mitigate this risk, consider the following:
  1. Use a more secure method to handle configuration data, such as storing it in environment variables or using secure storage mechanisms.
  2. Set appropriate permissions for the temporary file immediately after creation to limit its accessibility to only the necessary processes or users.
  3. Use `tempfile.mkstemp()` which provides better security as it opens the file in the most secure manner possible and returns a file descriptor, which you can use to write to the file.

Aside from this, the code does not show other apparent security defects within the context and functionality described. Ensure all external libraries and frameworks are kept up to date and configured securely, as vulnerabilities within them could indirectly affect the security of this code.
