Upon reviewing the provided code snippet, I identified a potential security defect related to CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation) due to an improper control of input values for a configuration option. This issue can lead to unintended behavior in the application.

### Identified Issue: CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
**Affected Line:** 
- Line 30 allows a default setting for the metrics collection interval and specifies a minimum value at line 31 using `min=-1`.

**Explanation:**
- The `collection_interval` option allows negative values (`min=-1`), where -1 is used to disable the functionality. However, other negative values (e.g., -2, -3, etc.) do not have a documented or clear purpose or effect based on the provided comments or help text. If the application does not handle other negative values correctly, this could lead to incorrect calculation of sleep times or intervals in the context of metrics collection. This can potentially cause unexpected or erroneous behavior.

### Recommended Solution:
To resolve this issue, consider the following adjustments:
1. Validate the `collection_interval` to ensure only the values 0, -1, or positive integers are permitted. This can be done by adding a custom validation function that raises an error or corrects the input if any value other than these allowed values is set.
2. Update the documentation in the help text to clearly specify which values are valid and their corresponding behaviors.
3. Optionally, provide a warning or error message if an unsupported negative value is set, guiding the user or administrator to correct the configuration.

By implementing these changes, you can ensure that the application behaves as expected and avoids potential errors related to incorrect time calculations for metrics collection.
