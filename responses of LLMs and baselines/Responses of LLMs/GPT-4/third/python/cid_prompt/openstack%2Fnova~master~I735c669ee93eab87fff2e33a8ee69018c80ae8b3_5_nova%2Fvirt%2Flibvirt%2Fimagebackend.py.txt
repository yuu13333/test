The provided code does not appear to contain security defects related to the specified Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. Here is a summary of each category and how it relates to the code:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: No apparent issues with improper access control mechanisms in the code that would allow unauthorized access or actions.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: No evident mishandling in the interactions between entities that could lead to unintended behaviors or states.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: The code properly manages the lifecycle of resources, such as files and devices, using exception handling and context managers to ensure proper cleanup.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: There are no incorrect calculations that could lead to incorrect program behavior or security issues.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: Control flows are managed adequately with explicit checks, exception handling, and conditions to handle different states and errors.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: The code doesnâ€™t show failures in protection mechanisms that would expose it to risk.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: The comparisons made throughout the code are appropriate for their contexts, with no incorrect comparisons identified that could impact security.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: The code properly checks and handles exceptional conditions using appropriate exception handling constructs.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: There's no evidence of issues related to the improper neutralization of input or output that could lead to injection or other attacks.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The code generally adheres to coding standards, and no clear violations were found that would impact its security posture.

In conclusion, based on the provided code snippets and the CWE categories focused on, no security defects are detected in the code.
