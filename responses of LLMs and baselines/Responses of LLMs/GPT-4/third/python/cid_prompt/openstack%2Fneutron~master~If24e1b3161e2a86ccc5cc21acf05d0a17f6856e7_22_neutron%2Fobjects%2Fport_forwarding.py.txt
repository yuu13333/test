Upon reviewing the provided code for security defects, I've identified potential issues with CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) and CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization).

1. **CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**
   - In lines 77-81, there is a handling of a static or class-level variable `FIP_OBJ` that stores state across different instances of `PortForwarding`. This can lead to issues where the `FIP_OBJ` may not accurately represent the state for each individual object instance, especially in multi-threaded or asynchronous environments, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or data leaks between processing different user's requests.

   **Solution**: Each object instance should manage its own state, or there should be explicit handling to ensure thread safety and isolation between object instances. Consider removing the static nature of the `FIP_OBJ` or ensuring it is refreshed or reinitialized appropriately in each relevant method call.

2. **CWE-707: Improper Neutralization**
   - In lines 99-104 and 107-115, the methods `modify_fields_from_db` and `modify_fields_to_db` deal with the transformation of the `socket` field, splitting it into `internal_ip_address` and `internal_port`, or combining these back into `socket`. The transformation assumes the format and content of the `socket` are correct without validation. If the `socket` format is incorrect or maliciously crafted, it may lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks.

   **Solution**: Add validation checks to ensure the `socket` format matches expected patterns before splitting it. Ensure that data is properly sanitized and validated both when reading from and writing to the database.

These issues should be addressed to enhance the security and robustness of the code.
