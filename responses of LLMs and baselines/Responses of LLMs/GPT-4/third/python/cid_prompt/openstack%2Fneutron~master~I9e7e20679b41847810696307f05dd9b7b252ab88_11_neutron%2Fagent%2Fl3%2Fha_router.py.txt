After reviewing the provided code, I found one potential security defect related to CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):

**Defect Description**:
- The code does not handle exceptions for file operations robustly in a few places. Specifically, the use of generic exceptions like `OSError` and `IOError` could be insufficient in some cases where more specific error handling is necessary.

**Location**:
- Lines 104-106: The error handling for reading the HA state file is vague. While it does log a debug message on failure, it doesn't distinguish between different types of I/O errors, such as file not found, permission errors, or disk full conditions.
- Lines 114-116: Similarly, the error handling when writing the HA state file uses broad exception types and only logs errors without handling specific scenarios.

**Recommendation**:
- Refine exception handling by identifying specific exceptions that should be handled differently. This might include handling `PermissionError` or `FileNotFoundError` separately to provide more granular error information or to implement fallback strategies.
- Implement more detailed error logging or recovery mechanisms depending on the type of error. For example, if a file cannot be accessed due to permissions, the system might attempt to reset permissions (if appropriate) or alert the administrator directly with a specific error message.

These improvements can help enhance the robustness of the system by better managing exceptional conditions, leading to more stable and predictable software behavior under error conditions.
