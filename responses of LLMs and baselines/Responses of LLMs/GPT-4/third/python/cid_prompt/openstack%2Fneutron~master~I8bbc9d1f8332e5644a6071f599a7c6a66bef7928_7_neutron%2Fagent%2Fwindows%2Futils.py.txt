Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a potential security defect related to CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure). The issue is primarily related to the use of environment variables and subprocess invocation.

1. **CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure**

   In the function `create_process` (lines 36-53), the environment variables (`env`) are copied and potentially modified with additional environment variables (`addl_env`) provided by the caller. This approach is generally safe. However, since the subprocess is invoked with `shell=False` (line 45), the command passed as a list of arguments is not executed through a shell, which is indeed a good security practice to avoid shell injection vulnerabilities. But this setting does not interact with the environment variables issue.

   The defect arises from not restricting or sanitizing the environment variables (`env`) that could be modified via `addl_env`. If the external caller can influence `addl_env`, they might be able to modify critical environment variables that the subprocess relies on, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors or security vulnerabilities, depending on the command being executed.

   **Solution**: It would be advisable to establish a whitelist of permissible environment variables that can be modified via `addl_env` or more strictly control the types of modifications allowed to `os.environ.copy()`. Implementing a validation mechanism to check the safety or appropriateness of the environment changes would mitigate risks related to unintended environmental influence on the subprocess execution.

Additionally, while this does not strictly constitute a CWE entry you've provided, there is a general security concern about error handling:

- **Error Handling Concern**: In the function `kill_process` (lines 56-63), there is an exception handling mechanism where a `ProcessExecutionError` is caught, and the code checks if the process is still running (using `process_is_running`). If the process is still active, the exception is re-raised (line 62). However, if `process_is_running` also fails or returns `False`, the function ends without any error or exception being reported or logged. This might lead to situations where a failure to kill a process goes unnoticed.

   **Solution**: Enhance error logging to ensure that every failure scenario, especially those where an action as critical as killing a process fails, is properly logged or handled. It might also be beneficial to ensure that the state of the system is checked or logged after such an operation to confirm the expected outcome.
