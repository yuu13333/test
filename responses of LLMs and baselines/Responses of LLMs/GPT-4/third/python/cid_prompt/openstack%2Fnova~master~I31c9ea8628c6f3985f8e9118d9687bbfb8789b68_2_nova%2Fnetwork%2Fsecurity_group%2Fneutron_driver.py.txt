The provided code shows several security-related functions for handling security groups and their rules within a networking context, likely as part of a cloud computing platform. After reviewing the code, here are some identified security defects categorized by the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE):

1. **CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**
   - Line 308: If a `NeutronClientException` with a status code of `404` occurs while trying to fetch a security group rule, the exception is caught and re-raised without specific handling. This might allow exceptional conditions to propagate when more graceful recovery could be possible.
   - General throughout: There are multiple places in the code (like line 482 and line 535) where generic
