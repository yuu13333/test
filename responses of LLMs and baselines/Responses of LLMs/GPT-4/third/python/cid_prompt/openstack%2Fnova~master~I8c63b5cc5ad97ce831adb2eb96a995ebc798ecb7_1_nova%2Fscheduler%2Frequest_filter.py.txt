Upon reviewing the provided code snippet, I found two potential security defects, specifically related to CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions) and CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime). Here are the details:

### CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions

**Location**: Lines 65-66 and 107-109
**Description**: In both `require_tenant_aggregate` and `map_az_to_placement_aggregate` functions, the method `objects.AggregateList.get_by_metadata()` is called without any exception handling mechanism for possible failures or exceptions that may occur during the database query. This lack of exception handling could lead to unhandled exceptions if the database query fails, which could interrupt the flow of the application or lead to improper processing of the request.

**Solution**: Implement a try-except block around the database query calls to handle possible exceptions gracefully. For instance, log the error and potentially set default values or handle the condition without causing a complete disruption.

### CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime

**Location**: Lines 149-150
**Description**: In the `require_image_type_support` function, the request specification (`request_spec`) is modified directly by adding traits to `extra_specs` and then resetting changes. However, if an error occurs after modifying the `request_spec` but before it is reset, the modifications would persist unexpectedly in subsequent operations, potentially affecting other parts of the application or future decisions based on this data.

**Solution**: Ensure that any modification to shared resources like `request_spec` is either fully controlled in an atomic manner or implement a mechanism to revert changes if a subsequent error occurs. This could involve using more comprehensive state management or transaction-like mechanisms where changes are only committed if all operations are successful.

These issues highlight the need for robust error handling and careful management of shared resources within the code to prevent unexpected behaviors and maintain the integrity and reliability of the application.
