Upon reviewing the provided code, which is a Python script related to the RFB security proxy negotiation for a Nova console, I identified a potential security issue related to the CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) and CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure).

### Identified Issue: CWE-664 and CWE-693

The issue arises in how error conditions and security negotiations are handled between different entities (tenant and compute nodes). Specifically, if an exception or error occurs during the security negotiation phase, the script sends failure messages to both the client (tenant_sock) and the server (compute_sock) but does not ensure proper closure or cleanup of socket resources. This can potentially lead to resource leaks or improper state in distributed system communications, thereby making the system vulnerable to denial of service attacks or leaving unused sockets open, which could be exploited further.

#### Example Code Snippet:
1. In the method `_fail` (lines 60-69), if there is a failure in authentication or security negotiation, the sockets are used to send failure messages but there's no explicit closure of these socket connections. This can lead to open socket resources if not handled properly elsewhere.

### Recommendations:

To mitigate this vulnerability:
- Ensure that all socket connections are properly closed when they are no longer needed or when an exception occurs. This could be achieved by implementing a try-finally block to manage the socket resources.
- Use context managers if the socket library supports them, or explicitly call `close()` on socket objects in the `finally` block to ensure resources are released correctly regardless of whether an error occurs.

#### Suggested Code Adjustment:

Implement socket closure inside the `_fail` method and after raising exceptions in the `connect` method:

```python
def _fail(self, tenant_sock, compute_sock, message):
    try:
        result_code = struct.pack("!I", 1)
        tenant_sock.sendall(result_code + self._make_var_str(message))
        if compute_sock is not None:
            compute_sock.sendall(auth.AUTH_STATUS_FAIL)
    finally:
        tenant_sock.close()
        if compute_sock:
            compute_sock.close()
```

Ensure similar resource management is implemented throughout the script where sockets are used, particularly in error handling scenarios.
