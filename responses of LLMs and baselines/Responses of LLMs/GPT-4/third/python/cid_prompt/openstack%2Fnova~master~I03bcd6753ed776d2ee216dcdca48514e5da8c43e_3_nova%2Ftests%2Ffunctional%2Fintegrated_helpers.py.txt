After reviewing the provided code for security defects related to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list, here are my findings:

1. **CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**
   - Line 135 in the code handles a potential `OpenStackApiNotFoundException` exception which may occur if a server does not exist when trying to check if it has been deleted.
