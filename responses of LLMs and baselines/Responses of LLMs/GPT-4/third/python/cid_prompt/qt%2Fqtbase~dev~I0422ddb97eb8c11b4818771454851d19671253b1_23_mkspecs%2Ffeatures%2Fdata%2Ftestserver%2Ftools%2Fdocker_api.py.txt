The provided code has several potential security defects related to Docker configuration and manipulation. Here are the identified issues:

### CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime

**Issue**: The code uses `open` to read files in `copy_commands` (line 112) without properly managing the file resource, potentially leading to resource leaks if not correctly closed.

**Solution**: Use a `with` statement to ensure that the file is properly closed after its contents have been read:
```python
with open(copy_file.src, 'r') as file:
    dummy_str = str_encode_hex(file.read())
```

### CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure

**Issue**: The program uses `os.environ.has_key("TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL")` in `export_ports` (line 99) which is not recommended. The `has_key` method is deprecated and can lead to errors or unexpected behavior in newer Python versions.

**Solution**: Replace it with the `in` keyword to check for key existence:
```python
if "TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL" in os.environ:
```

### CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions

**Issue**: There are several places where errors from subprocesses are checked (lines 161, 180) but not properly logged or handled beyond printing and exiting. This abrupt exit might not provide sufficient information for debugging or allow for graceful shutdown in a production environment.

**Solution**: Enhance error handling by logging the error and considering a more structured error handling mechanism than just exiting:
```python
if stderr:
    logging.error('Error during docker operation: %s', stderr)
    # Consider raising an exception or other error handling strategies
```

### CWE-707: Improper Neutralization

**Issue**: The use of formatting with unvalidated input in constructing Docker commands (lines 154, 173, 197) could be vulnerable if the input is not properly validated or sanitized. This could potentially lead to command injection if external input is used to form these commands.

**Solution**: Validate and sanitize all inputs used in command construction. Consider using stricter input validation or escaping mechanisms to prevent command injection.

### CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards

**Issue**: The code uses several old Python constructs like `print stderr` (line 162) which is not valid in Python 3. The use of `.split()` in subprocess calls (line 155) can be error-prone if there are spaces in filenames or other arguments.

**Solution**: Use `print(stderr)` for Python 3 compatibility. Avoid using `.split()` for splitting commands and instead use lists to pass arguments to `Popen` to safely handle arguments with spaces:
```python
Popen(['docker', 'build', '-', '--quiet', '-t', config.image_name], ...)
```

These defects indicate potential areas for improvements in terms of security and robustness, especially when dealing with file handling and subprocess management in a Python script designed for Docker configuration and control.
