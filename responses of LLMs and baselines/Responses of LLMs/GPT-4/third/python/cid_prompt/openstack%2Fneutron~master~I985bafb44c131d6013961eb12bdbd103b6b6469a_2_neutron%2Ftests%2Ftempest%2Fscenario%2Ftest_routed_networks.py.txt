Upon reviewing the provided code, several potential security defects corresponding to the specified CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) categories were identified. Here are the findings:

### 1. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
**Code Line(s):** 124-135
**Issue Description:**
In this code snippet, a private key file is written to a temporary file (`key_file_path`) on the disk. Although the file is removed after its use, this still poses a risk if the removal fails or if an attacker accesses the system between write and delete operations.

**Solution:**
Use secure handling practices for sensitive data like private keys. Ideally, avoid writing them to disk. If necessary, ensure they are stored securely (e.g., encrypted at rest) and limit their exposure time. Consider using in-memory data structures or secure vault solutions.

### 2. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
**Code Line(s):** 116-135
**Issue Description:**
The `ssh_check` method uses command concatenation with variables that might be controlled externally, which can potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if not properly sanitized or validated.

**Solution:**
Always sanitize and validate external input used in command lines. Additionally, use parameterized subprocess calls to prevent shell injection.

### 3. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
**Code Line(s):** 122-135
**Issue Description:**
The use of subprocess with `shell=True` without proper exception handling could lead to situations where the subprocess call fails without recovery or proper logging. This is risky especially when deleting security-sensitive files as it might leave private data exposed.

**Solution:**
Implement robust error handling around subprocess calls. Catch exceptions and ensure that cleanup operations (like file deletions) are attempted again or flagged for manual review if they fail initially.

### 4. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
**Code Line(s):** 82-91
**Issue Description:**
Security group rules are created allowing unrestricted inbound SSH access from any IP address. This broad access can be a significant security risk as it potentially opens the server to unauthorized access from any location.

**Solution:**
Restrict SSH access to a limited set of known IP addresses. Alternatively, use more dynamic methods such as VPNs or SSH bastion hosts for access control, reducing the exposure of cloud resources directly to the internet.

### Additional Recommendations
- **Resource Cleanup:** Ensure that all temporary files are securely deleted. Using `os.unlink()` might be more reliable than a subprocess call to `rm`.
- **Key Management:** As noted, consider implementing a key management policy or using a key management service (KMS) to handle private keys securely.

These security defects should be addressed to mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the application. Each solution provided aims to reduce the risk associated with the corresponding issue.
