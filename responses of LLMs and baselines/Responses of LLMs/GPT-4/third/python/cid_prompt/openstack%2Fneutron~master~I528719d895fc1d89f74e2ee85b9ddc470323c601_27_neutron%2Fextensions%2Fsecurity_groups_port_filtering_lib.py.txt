The code provided primarily involves configuration and metadata definitions for an extension, specifically for port security groups filtering in a network-related software. Based on the code and considering the provided Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE), no direct security defects can be identified. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** - There is no implementation of access control mechanisms directly within the code, as it primarily defines constants and metadata.
   
2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)** - The code lacks any operations or interactions between multiple systems or components that could be improperly managed.
   
3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)** - This code snippet does not manage resources whose lifetime or state would be relevant to this CWE.
   
4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)** - No calculations are performed in this code.
   
5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)** - This is a straightforward declaration of variables and configuration without any complex control flow or error handling.
   
6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)** - There are no explicit protection mechanisms implemented or failed in this snippet.
   
7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)** - No comparisons are made in this script.
   
8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)** - The code does not handle exceptions or check for abnormal conditions.
   
9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)** - This CWE typically involves inputs that are not neutralized properly, but the snippet does not deal with input handling.
   
10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)** - The code adheres to general coding standards for configuration settings and metadata definition without deviation that would introduce security risks.

In summary, the code does not exhibit typical vulnerabilities as it seems to deal with the definition of an API or extension attributes rather than implementation logic that manipulates or interacts with data or resources in a manner vulnerable to exploitation. Thus, **no security defects are detected in the code**.
