Reviewing the provided OpenStack Nova code, specifically the `WSGIAppTest` class, the following security defect is identified:

### Security Defect:

**Potential Security Risk with Temporary Files (Line 39)**
- The use of `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for writing configuration data without explicit control over permissions can pose a security risk. This creates a temporary file on the disk that might be readable or writable by other system users, especially if the application runs in a shared environment or multi-user system.

### Solution:

To mitigate the security risks associated with temporary files:
1. Ensure that temporary files are created with restricted access permissions. Pythonâ€™s `tempfile` module allows specifying the permissions mode. You can restrict the file access to only the current user, which would prevent other users from accessing this file.
2. Consider cleaning up the temporary file immediately after its use to minimize the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit the temporary file.

Here's a suggested modification to the code to address this issue:

```python
import os

# Use the tempfile module with added security for file permissions
self.conf = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+t', delete=False)
self.conf.write(self._paste_config.lstrip())
self.conf.seek(0)
self.conf.flush()

# Ensure the file is readable/writable only by the user
os.chmod(self.conf.name, 0o600)  # Sets the file mode to 600, restricting access to the owner only
```

Implementing this change would help in enhancing the security by ensuring that temporary files are not exposed to unauthorized access.
