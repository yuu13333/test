After reviewing the provided code, I identified a few potential security concerns related to the handling of SSH keys and command execution. Here are the details:

### Security Issue: Writing Private SSH Keys to Disk
The method `_ssh_check` writes a private SSH key to a temporary file on the filesystem, which could be exploited if an attacker gains access to the filesystem.

**Location:** Line 124

**Description:** Writing sensitive information such as SSH private keys to disk can expose the keys to unauthorized access, especially if the file permissions are not securely managed.

**Solution:** Avoid writing private keys to disk. Instead, consider using SSH client configurations that can accept private keys from memory or use an SSH agent to handle keys securely.

### Security Issue: Command Injection via Shell Execution
The method `_ssh_check` uses shell=True in `subprocess.call`, which can be risky if any of the variables passed to the shell command are derived from external inputs or are otherwise manipulable.

**Location:** Line 127

**Description:** Using `shell=True` with `subprocess.call` can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the parameters (such as `namespace` or `key_file_path`) are not properly sanitized or controlled.

**Solution:** Avoid using `shell=True`. Instead, use the list format of `subprocess.call` to ensure that arguments are properly escaped. Additionally, validate and sanitize all inputs that could be used to form shell commands.

### Suggested Code Modifications:
Here's how the `_ssh_check` function could be rewritten to address these issues:

```python
import shlex

def _ssh_check(self, username, ip, namespace, private_key, retries=10):
    """Improved version with security enhancements."""
    key_file_path = '/tmp/testkey.dat'
    ssh_command = f'ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ConnectTimeout=10 -i {shlex.quote(key_file_path)} {shlex.quote(username)}@{shlex.quote(ip)} id'
    all_cmd = f'sudo ip net exec {shlex.quote(namespace)} {ssh_command}'
    
    # Create a temporary in-memory file-like object for the private key
    import io
    key_stream = io.StringIO(private_key)
    
    # Use subprocess.Popen to securely handle the private key
    import subprocess
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['ssh', '-i', '-', '-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null', '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no', 'ConnectTimeout=10', f'{username}@{ip}', 'id'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE)
    proc.communicate(input=key_stream.getvalue().encode())

    for i in range(retries):
        ret = proc.returncode
        if ret == 0:
            break
        time.sleep(3)

    # Ensure we provide the correct assertion error message
    assert ret == 0, 'instance is down'
```

These modifications improve the security by avoiding writing the SSH key to disk and removing the use of `shell=True` in subprocess calls. Additionally, they demonstrate how to handle SSH key injection securely into the command using an in-memory file-like object.
