The code for the `MountManager` class in OpenStack Nova provided contains several potential security vulnerabilities:

### 1. Race Condition Vulnerability

**Lines:** 109-119 in the `mount` method.

**Issue:** The code performs checks (`if not mount.mounted`) and actions (`utils.execute('mkdir', '-p', mountpoint)`) separately, which is an example of a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. This issue may occur if the `mountpoint` status changes between the check and the use, potentially leading to multiple threads attempting to mount the filesystem simultaneously, which can result in errors or inconsistent state.

**Solution:** Ensure atomicity of check-and-act operations by using more robust synchronization mechanisms or by leveraging file system operations that atomically check and perform actions, such as creating directories only if they don't already exist.

### 2. Command Injection Vulnerability

**Lines:** 112, 117, 145, 152 in the `mount` and `umount` methods.

**Issue:** The methods use the `utils.execute` function which directly passes parameters to the system shell. If variables like `fstype`, `export`, `vol_name`, `mountpoint`, and `options` are not properly sanitized and contain malicious input (e.g., command separators like semicolons or shell commands), they could be used to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.

**Solution:** Properly sanitize and validate all input parameters to ensure they do not contain malicious content before passing them to the shell. Additionally, consider using more secure methods to execute system commands that do not involve the shell directly, thus avoiding shell-specific vulnerabilities.

### 3. Improper Exception Handling

**Lines:** 123-131 in the `mount` method.

**Issue:** The `except` block handles any exception by removing the `mountpoint` from `mountpoints` without ensuring that the failure was due to the mount operation itself. This might lead to unintended side-effects where legitimate entries are deleted in case of unrelated exceptions.

**Solution:** Narrow down the exception handling to specific errors that indicate a mount failure. Ensure that other types of exceptions do not lead to unintended deletion of mount points.

### 4. Potential Resource Leak

**Lines:** 138-153 in the `umount` method.

**Issue:** The method might leave resources improperly handled if an exception occurs during the unmount process (e.g., if the `umount` command fails but the directory is not removed). This can lead to leftover directories and potential security risks.

**Solution:** Ensure that resource cleanup is handled in a `finally` block or similar construct to guarantee execution regardless of previous errors.

### 5. Inconsistent State Management

**Line:** 150 incorrectly sets `self.mounted` to `False` which should actually be `mount.mounted`. This is a bug rather than a security defect, but it's critical as it can lead to inconsistent state tracking.

**Solution:** Correct the code to `mount.mounted = False` to properly reflect the state of the individual mount.

By addressing these issues, the robustness and security of the `MountManager` class can be significantly improved.
