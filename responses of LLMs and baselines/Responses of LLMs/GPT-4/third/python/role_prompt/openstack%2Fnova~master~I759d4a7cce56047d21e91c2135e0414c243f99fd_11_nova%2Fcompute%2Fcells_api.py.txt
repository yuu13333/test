After reviewing the provided code snippet, which is a part of the OpenStack Nova project with a focus on handling compute operations across cells, the following potential security defect has been identified:

**Issue: Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability**
- **Location:** Lines 85-91 in the `ConductorTaskRPCAPIRedirect` class and lines 65-71 in the `ComputeRPCAPIRedirect` class.
- **Description:**
    The `__getattr__` methods in both `ConductorTaskRPCAPIRedirect` and `ComputeRPCAPIRedirect` classes could potentially allow for remote code execution or unintended behavior. These methods are designed to dynamically handle calls to attributes/methods that are not explicitly defined within the objects. If the attribute (`key`) accessed is not within the predefined list `cells_compatible`, a no-operation function `_noop_rpc_wrapper` is returned. While this function itself does nothing harmful (returns `None`), the dynamic nature of `__getattr__` can lead to security risks, particularly if external input can influence the `key` values. For instance, if an attacker manages to pass a malicious key that matches a method name in `cells_rpcapi` that could perform sensitive operations or is capable of executing arbitrary code, it might lead to an unintended method execution.

**Recommendation:**
To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to implement stricter controls on what methods can be accessed via `__getattr__`. Here are a couple of approaches:
1. **Explicitly Define Allowed Methods:** Instead of returning a no-operation function for non-defined methods, it might be safer to raise an exception, indicating an attempt to access an unauthorized method. This change would prevent any method outside the `cells_compatible` list from being called, thus reducing the risk of accidental or malicious method invocations.
2. **Input Validation:** Add further validation checks to ensure that the keys provided to `__getattr__` conform to expected patterns or names, and log or handle attempts that deviate from these expected values. This approach could help in identifying potential intrusion attempts or misconfigurations.

Implementing these recommendations will help to ensure that the application behaves securely and only allowed operations are executed, reducing the surface for potential security exploits.
