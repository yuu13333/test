After reviewing the provided code snippet from the Nova component in OpenStack, specifically focusing on policy definitions and their usage, I have detected a potential security defect:

**Security Defect:**
The defect lies in the path specification within the `DocumentedRuleDefault` definitions. Both policies (line 21 and line 31) are intended for different purposes (`'index'` and `'host_info:index'`) but mistakenly share the same API endpoint path `/servers/{server_id}/topology` (line 28 and line 39). This could lead to potential security risks where users authorized to view basic NUMA topology data (line 24) might unintentionally access more sensitive host NUMA and CPU pinning information (line 35) due to the shared endpoint.

**Solution:**
To rectify this issue, ensure that each policy maps to a distinct and appropriate API endpoint that aligns with the intended access level and data sensitivity. For instance, the policy for `'host_info:index'` could be modified to use a different path that more clearly signifies access to more sensitive data, such as `/servers/{server_id}/topology/host-info`. Here's the corrected version of the policy:

```python
31     policy.DocumentedRuleDefault(
32         # control host NUMA node and cpu pinning information
33         BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'host_info:index',
34         base.RULE_ADMIN_API,
35         "List host NUMA id and cpu pinning information of given server",
36         [
37             {
38                 'method': 'GET',
39                 'path': '/servers/{server_id}/topology/host-info'
40             }
41         ]),
```

This modification not only addresses the security defect by segregating the access to sensitive information but also clarifies the API's routing structure, making it more intuitive and secure.
