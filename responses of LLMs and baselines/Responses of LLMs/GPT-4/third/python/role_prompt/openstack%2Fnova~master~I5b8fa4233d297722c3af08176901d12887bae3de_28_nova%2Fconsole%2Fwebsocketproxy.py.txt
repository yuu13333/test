After reviewing the provided code snippet, I found a few security-related concerns, specifically around the handling of cookies and headers, and potential issues with scheme validation and error handling. Here are the details and suggested fixes:

### 1. Cookie Security (Lines 91-105)
The code retrieves a token from a cookie, potentially allowing session hijacking if the cookies are not properly secured. The cookie handling does not explicitly set security properties such as HttpOnly and Secure flags. These flags help protect cookies from being accessed by client-side scripts and ensure they are sent only over secure connections.

**Solution:**
Ensure that cookies have the HttpOnly and Secure flags set. This might be handled elsewhere in the server configuration, but if not, it should be addressed.

### 2. Insecure Protocol Handling (Lines 76-83)
The code checks for the URL scheme and explicitly raises an exception if the scheme is not `http` or `https` for Python versions below 2.7.4 due to a bug in `urlparse`. This can cause a denial of service if an unsupported scheme is provided.

**Solution:**
Update the server environment to a more recent and supported version of Python where this bug is fixed, thereby removing the need for this check. Ensuring that all Python packages are up-to-date can mitigate related vulnerabilities.

### 3. Origin Header Validation (Lines 115-138)
The server checks the `Origin` header to validate the request's origin. However, the implementation allows a non-browser client to bypass this validation if the `Origin` header is missing.

**Solution:**
Consider whether non-browser clients should be allowed. If not, enforce the presence of a valid `Origin` header. If they are allowed, ensure that their access is securely managed, potentially using additional authentication and authorization checks.

### 4. Exception Handling in WebSocket Connection (Lines 164-172)
When an exception occurs during proxying, the server attempts to shutdown and close the WebSocket connection. However, the exception handling does not differentiate between different types of exceptions, which can lead to incomplete error diagnostics and handling.

**Solution:**
Refine exception handling to manage different types of exceptions more appropriately. This can include logging specific error messages and ensuring all resources are properly cleaned up in case of errors.

### 5. Data Handling with Raw Sockets (Lines 150-160)
There is a block of code where raw socket operations are performed. This can be risky if not properly handled, as malformed or malicious data might not be properly processed.

**Solution:**
Ensure thorough validation and error handling around the data received from sockets. Consider timeouts and maximum data length checks to prevent issues like buffer overflows or hanging connections.

In summary, while the code has functional security checks, enhancing cookie security, updating Python versions, refining origin checks, and improving error handling and data validation can substantially improve security.
