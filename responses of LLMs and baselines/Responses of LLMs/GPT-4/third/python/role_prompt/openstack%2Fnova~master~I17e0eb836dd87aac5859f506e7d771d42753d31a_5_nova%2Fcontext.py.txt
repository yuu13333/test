After a thorough review of the provided code snippet from Nova in OpenStack, the following security defect has been identified:

**Security Defect: Potential Token Exposure**

- **Location**: Lines 55-58 in the `_ContextAuthPlugin` class.
- **Description**: The `get_token` method simply returns the `auth_token` stored in an instance of `_ContextAuthPlugin`. If this method or the instance is improperly handled, exposed, or logged, it can lead to token leakage. Tokens should be handled carefully, especially in contexts where they could be inadvertently logged or returned through APIs.
- **Solution**: Ensure that access to the `get_token` method is controlled and never exposed to logging or unintended API responses. You might consider encrypting the token in memory and only decrypting it when absolutely necessary. Additionally, audit the usage of this token across the system to ensure that it cannot be intercepted or exposed during transit and that it is properly invalidated when not needed anymore.

This identified issue focuses on secure handling of sensitive information, which is crucial in maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of authentication tokens. Implementing the suggested solutions will help in mitigating potential security risks associated with token exposure.
