After reviewing the code, I found two primary security concerns related to logging that could potentially expose sensitive data or cause information leakage. Below are the details of the defects found, along with the specific lines of code and recommended solutions:

### Security Defect 1: Information Leakage Through Logging

#### Description
Logging potentially sensitive data can expose information that might be used by an attacker. For instance, logging user input or system configurations without sanitization could expose private data or system details that might help an attacker.

#### Affected Lines
- **Line 83**: Logs potentially sensitive data related to resource amounts, which could include sensitive computation details or business-specific information.

#### Solution
Ensure that sensitive data is either sanitized before logging or that the logging level and storage are appropriately secured. Data can be sanitized by removing sensitive details or using hashing to obfuscate details.

### Security Defect 2: Error Handling that Exposes Sensitive Information

#### Description
Error messages that provide too much detail about the internal state or configuration of the application can aid attackers in crafting further attacks, or reveal information that should remain confidential.

#### Affected Lines
- **Lines 399-401**: The error message includes details about the internal state, such as the instance UUID and destination host, which could be used maliciously if logged or shown in an inappropriate context.

#### Solution
Customize error messages to avoid revealing specific details about the internal state or configuration. Ensure that messages intended for debugging are not displayed in user interfaces or logs accessible by users without appropriate access.

These issues should be addressed to improve the security posture of the system, ensuring that logging and error handling do not inadvertently expose sensitive information.
