The provided code is part of a VeNCrypt security proxy implementation for a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) session, which aims to use SSL/TLS for secure communication. Here is an analysis of potential security concerns:

### Potential Security Concerns

#### 1. Insecure Default Protocol
- **Issue**: The SSL protocol version is explicitly set to TLS 1.2.
- **Lines**: 144
- **Impact**: Restricting to TLS 1.2 may prevent the use of stronger protocols like TLS 1.3, which is considered more secure and efficient.
- **Solution**: Modify the code to allow higher versions of TLS if supported by both client and server environments. This can be done by setting `ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS` to use the highest version of TLS supported by the
