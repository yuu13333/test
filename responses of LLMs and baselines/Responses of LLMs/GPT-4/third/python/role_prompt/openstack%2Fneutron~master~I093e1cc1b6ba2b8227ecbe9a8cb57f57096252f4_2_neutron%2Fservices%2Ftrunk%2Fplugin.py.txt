After reviewing the provided code from the Neutron module in OpenStack, I have identified a security defect related to potential misuse of administrator privileges:

**Security Defect:**
- In the method `_extend_port_trunk_details()` (lines 44-61), the code retrieves port details using an administrator context (line 54). This context (`context.get_admin_context()`) provides full administrative privileges, bypassing any role-based access controls (RBAC) that might restrict access based on the requester's privileges. This could potentially allow a user with limited permissions to indirectly access sensitive data about ports that they shouldn't have access to.

**Solution:**
- Modify the code to use the context passed to the function or appropriately check the user's privileges before allowing access to such sensitive information. This ensures that only authorized users can fetch port details, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
- Example modification:
  ```python
  def _extend_port_trunk_details(core_plugin, port_res, port_db, request_context):
      # Add trunk details to a port using the request context for appropriate access control
      ...
      ports = core_plugin.get_ports(request_context, filters={'id': subports})
      ...
  ```

Additionally, the function should be modified to accept and use a `request_context` that should be passed from calling functions, which are expected to pass the appropriate context depending on the user's request.

**Code Safety and Practices:**
- The code is well structured for a large scale application like OpenStack and uses proper exception handling and modular architecture which is typical in such systems. However, the specific use of the administrative context without appropriate checks can lead to potential security issues as noted above.
