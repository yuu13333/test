Upon reviewing the provided code snippets, I identified a potential security defect related to file handling during the copying and restoring of TPM files. Here are the details:

### Security Defect: Insufficient Validation of File Paths
#### Location:
- `tpm_management.py` in functions `copy_tpm_files` and `restore_tpm_files`

#### Description:
The functions `copy_tpm_files` and `restore_tpm_files` directly use the `instance_uuid` provided to construct file paths. This process does not include validation to ensure that the `instance_uuid` does not contain any sequences that could lead to directory traversal or other forms of path manipulation attacks.

For example, an `instance_uuid` that includes sequences like `"../"` could potentially allow an attacker to navigate the filesystem to a location outside of the intended directory structure, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of files outside the designated TPM storage area.

#### Proposed Solution:
To mitigate this potential issue, the code should include a validation step to ensure that the `instance_uuid` strictly conforms to expected formatting rules (e.g., hexadecimal characters only). Any UUIDs not meeting these criteria should result in the function raising an error or refusing to proceed.

Here is how you can integrate a simple validation in `tpm_management.py`:

```python
import re

def validate_uuid(instance_uuid):
    """Validate that the provided UUID is in the correct format to prevent directory traversal."""
    if not re.match(r'^[a-f0-9\-]+$', instance_uuid):
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid UUID format: {instance_uuid}")

@privsep.libvirt.privsep_entrypoint
def copy_tpm_files(instance_uuid, dest_path):
    validate_uuid(instance_uuid)
    src_path = os.path.join(tpm_base_dir, instance_uuid)
    if not os.path.exists(src_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"No TPM data found for UUID {instance_uuid}")
    shutil.copytree(src_path, dest_path)
    print(f"TPM files copied from {src_path} to {dest_path}.")

@privsep.libvirt.privsep_entrypoint
def restore_tpm_files(instance_uuid, src_path):
    validate_uuid(instance_uuid)
    dest_path = os.path.join(tpm_base_dir, instance_uuid)
    if os.path.exists(dest_path):
        shutil.rmtree(dest_path)
    shutil.move(src_path, dest_path)
    print(f"TPM files restored to {dest_path} from {src_path}.")
```

By adding this UUID validation step, you can prevent potential misuse of the function with malformed or maliciously crafted UUID strings, enhancing the security of the file handling operations.
