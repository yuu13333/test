To accurately analyze the original code for security defects, I would need to see the specific source code you are referring to. The previous messages included only hypothetical examples of code that might be written to handle the situation described in your commit message, rather than any actual existing code. 

If you can provide the actual code snippets or files that need to be analyzed, I could then look for any potential security defects and provide a detailed analysis. Otherwise, based on the hypothetical code I provided, no security defects are detected since they were examples designed to illustrate how to handle a specific issue.
