Upon reviewing the original code, I have identified a potential security issue related to the handling of user and group identifiers. Specifically, there's a risk of a privilege escalation attack if the user or group identifiers are manipulated by an attacker.

Here's the detailed analysis of the security defect:

### Security Defect:
**Risk:** Privilege Escalation  
**Location:** Lines 71-72  
**Description:** The `user` and `group` variables are retrieved from the configuration without proper validation or sanitization. If these values can be controlled or manipulated by an attacker, they could specify privileged system users or groups, leading to a privilege escalation attack.  

### Solution:
1. **Validate Input:** Ensure that the `user` and `group` values are validated against a whitelist of permitted users and groups. Reject any values that are not explicitly allowed.
2. **Use System Calls Safely:** Instead of directly using the user and group identifiers from the configuration, use system calls like `getpwnam` and `getgrnam` to retrieve the corresponding user and group entries by name. This ensures that only valid and existing users and groups are used.
3. **Least Privilege Principle:** Ideally, the proxy service should run with the least privileges necessary to perform its functions. Avoid using privileged system users or groups unless absolutely necessary.

### Example Fix:
```python
# Validate and sanitize user and group identifiers
try:
    pw_user = pwd.getpwnam(self.user)
    username = pw_user[0]
except KeyError:
    # Handle invalid user
    raise Exception("Invalid user specified in configuration")

try:
    group_info = grp.getgrnam(self.group)
    groupname = group_info.gr_name
except KeyError:
    # Handle invalid group
    raise Exception("Invalid group specified in configuration")
```

By implementing these solutions, the code can mitigate the risk of privilege escalation attacks by ensuring that only valid and permitted user and group identifiers are used.
