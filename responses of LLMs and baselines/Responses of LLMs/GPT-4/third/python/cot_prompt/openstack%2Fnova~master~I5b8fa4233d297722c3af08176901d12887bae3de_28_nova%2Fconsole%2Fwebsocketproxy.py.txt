After reviewing the provided original code snippet, I've identified a few security-related concerns and potential vulnerabilities. Here's a detailed analysis:

### 1. Token Handling and Leakage
**Location**: Lines 85-106

**Description**: The original code retrieves a token from the URL query parameters and from cookies, which is standard practice. However, there is a concern about how these tokens are handled and possibly logged or exposed in exceptions without masking. Tokens are sensitive and should be treated as such to avoid potential leakage.

**Solution**: Ensure that tokens are always masked when used in logs, error messages, or any form of output. Use the `strutils.mask_password` utility from the `oslo_utils` library for masking tokens. Ensure that any logged information that could contain the token is appropriately masked to prevent accidental exposure.

### 2. Cookie Handling
**Location**: Lines 91-104

**Description**: The code attempts to parse cookies manually and might fail to handle some cookie attributes properly, which could lead to security issues such as improper token validation or session hijacking.

**Solution**: Use a more robust method to parse cookies. Consider using libraries that properly handle cookie parsing and validation to avoid security pitfalls. Ensure that security flags like HttpOnly and Secure are used with cookies to enhance security.

### 3. Exception Handling and Information Disclosure
**Location**: Lines 81-83, 111-112, 134-135, 137-138

**Description**: The exceptions raised contain detailed information about the internal state or configuration, such as supported schemes or reasons for validation failures. This can be leveraged by an attacker to gather information about the backend systems or to refine attack vectors.

**Solution**: Genericize error messages to avoid revealing details about the backend configuration or the reasons for input rejections. Log detailed information for debugging internally but restrict what is communicated back to the client.

### 4. Inadequate Origin Header Validation
**Location**: Lines 123-137

**Description**: The code checks for valid origins to protect against Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). However, the validation is incomplete and does not adequately enforce checks against a predefined list of allowed origins or proper scheme matching, which can lead to potential security breaches if an attacker can spoof these headers.

**Solution**: Strengthen origin checks by verifying both the hostname and protocol against a well-defined list of allowed origins and schemes. Enforce strict matching and consider implementing additional Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) checks.

### Summary
The original code has several areas where security could be enhanced, particularly around token and cookie handling, exception messaging, and origin validation. Implementing the suggested solutions would help mitigate potential vulnerabilities and strengthen the overall security posture of the application.
