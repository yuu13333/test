After reviewing the provided code for potential security defects in the context of CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) identifiers, the following observation was made:

**Potential Security Issue: Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)**
- **Description**: The code defines `TENANT_METADATA_KEY` with a hard-coded value `'filter_tenant_id'` on line 28. While this in itself isn't necessarily a security defect, it points towards a potential misuse or a greater security concern if the metadata key is used in a security-sensitive context, for example, when fetching aggregates in the `require_tenant_aggregate` function (lines 65-72).
- **Solution**: Although directly not a vulnerability in the given context, using hard-coded identifiers or keys in code can potentially lead to security issues if the identifiers are known publicly and used maliciously. It is recommended to store such keys in configuration files or environment variables, which can be securely managed without hard-coding them in the source code.

Overall, the code mainly involves configuration and logging functionalities, with specific attention to security handling via exception management and boolean checks, which do not directly pose security defects as per the given code snippet. Other than the observation noted above, no immediate CWE-related security defects are apparent from the provided code.
