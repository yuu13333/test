No security defects are detected in the code based on the provided snippet and within the scope of the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. The code mainly deals with resource fetching and authorization, using appropriate exception handling and logging to manage errors and access violations. The use of libraries like `oslo_policy` for policy checks and handling ensures that actions are authorized correctly, reducing the risk of security issues like unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

However, it's important to consider that full security analysis might require a deeper examination including configuration files, specific implementation details of methods, and the broader context of how these functions integrate into the overall application. Security reviews should ideally be complemented with additional techniques such as static code analysis, dynamic analysis, and penetration testing to provide a comprehensive security assessment.
