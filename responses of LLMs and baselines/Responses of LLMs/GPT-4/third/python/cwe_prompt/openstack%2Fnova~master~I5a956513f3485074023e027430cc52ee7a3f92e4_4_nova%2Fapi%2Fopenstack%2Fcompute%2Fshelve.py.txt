No security defects are detected in the code based on the provided code snippet and the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) as a reference standard. The code largely involves handling various states and exceptions of virtual machine instances in a cloud environment, and the main interactions are well-guarded by exception handling and security policies checks, as seen in lines like 42-45, 62, and 82.

The functions properly handle the potential errors through the `except` blocks and use the Nova policy library to check permissions, which mitigates common security issues such as unauthorized access and improper error handling. Furthermore, appropriate HTTP error codes and messages are used to communicate issues back to the user, ensuring transparency and proper communication of server-side issues without revealing sensitive information. The code adheres to good security practices in the context of a web service for virtual machine management.
