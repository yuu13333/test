No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code snippet consists of configuration and metadata definitions for what appears to be an extension related to port filtering on security groups within a software system. It includes variables for the alias, the nature of the extension, description, and other metadata about the extension, such as when it was introduced and resource attribute maps. There are no operations on data inputs, no algorithmic processes, and no interactions with external systems that would typically be associated with common security risks such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.

This type of code is generally not susceptible to the common vulnerabilities listed in the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) since it largely involves static definitions without execution of operations or data handling that would expose the system to security risks.
