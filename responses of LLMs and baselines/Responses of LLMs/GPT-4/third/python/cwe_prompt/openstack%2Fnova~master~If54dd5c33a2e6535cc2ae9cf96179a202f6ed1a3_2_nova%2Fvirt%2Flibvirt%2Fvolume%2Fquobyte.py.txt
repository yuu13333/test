Upon reviewing the provided code, no explicit security defects based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) are detected. The code appears to handle potential errors and exceptions in a reasonable manner, and it adheres to best practices such as checking for system states and handling permissions correctly with respect to mounting and unmounting volumes.

However, there are general recommendations that could be considered to further enhance the robustness of the code:

1. **Usage of the `six` library for compatibility**: The use of `six` in line 99 could be phased out in favor of native Python 3 libraries since Python 2 is officially out of support. This isn't a security issue per se but modernizing the code to rely solely on Python 3 features could improve maintainability and reduce future compatibility issues.

2. **Error Handling**: While the code does handle a variety of error cases, including logging and raising exceptions appropriately, it could be beneficial to ensure all external commands executed (such as `processutils.execute` in line 62) are consistently handled throughout the codebase to prevent any unexpected behavior or information leaks through error messages.

3. **Global Variables**: The use of global variables (e.g., `_is_systemd` in line 50) can be risky in multi-threaded environments if not handled carefully. Ensuring that these variables are accessed and modified thread-safely is crucial, though the existing use of `utils.synchronized` decorator suggests an awareness of concurrency issues.

4. **Hardcoded Values**: There are a few instances where values are hardcoded (e.g., system states in line 41, `systemctl` path in line 58). It might be beneficial to externalize such configurations to allow easier adjustments without modifying the code.

To sum up, while no CWE-listed security defects are detected in this code, continuous vigilance and adherence to best practices in coding and security are recommended.
