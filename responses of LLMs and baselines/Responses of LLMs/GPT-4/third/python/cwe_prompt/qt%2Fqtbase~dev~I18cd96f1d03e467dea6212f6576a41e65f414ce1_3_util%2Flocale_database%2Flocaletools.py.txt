The code provided is fairly robust in handling file operations and uses context managers effectively to ensure proper cleanup. However, I identified a potential security defect related to CWE-367 (Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition). Here's the detail:

### Security Defect Description
The code segment responsible for handling file operations, particularly during the renaming of a temporary file to replace an original file, might be vulnerable to a TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race condition. This occurs when a file's state can change between the moment it is checked and the moment it is used. In this specific instance, the issue arises between closing the temporary file and renaming it to the original file location (lines 91-94). If the state or contents of the original file change after it's been checked and closed but before the temporary file is renamed, the operation could end up using outdated or incorrect data.

### Code Reference
```python
91         tempFile.close()
92         originalFile.close()
93         # Move the modified file to the original location
94         Path(tempFile.name).rename(originalFile.name)
```

### Suggested Solution
To mitigate this risk, ensure that the file operations are atomic and monitor the file state more closely to prevent unauthorized changes between the check and use phases. This could involve:

1. **Locking the file**: Implement file locking mechanisms to prevent other processes from modifying the file between the close and rename operations.
2. **Using more robust file handling libraries or functions**: Some platforms provide ways to perform atomic rename operations that also check the file state just before renaming.
3. **Verifying file integrity**: Before performing the rename, re-check the original file's state or integrity to ensure no changes occurred since the last check.

By addressing this potential vulnerability, the code can be safeguarded against race conditions that might lead to security flaws or data corruption.
