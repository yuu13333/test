Reviewing the provided code snippet for security defects using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards, I found a notable security issue:

### Issue: Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)
**Location:** Line 33-38 in `extract_password` function.

**Description:** The function `extract_password` compiles passwords from instance metadata, which suggests that passwords may be stored in plaintext or weakly encoded within system metadata. Storing passwords without strong encryption or hashing poses a significant risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data, especially if an attacker gains access to the metadata storage.

**Solution:** 
- Ensure passwords are stored using a strong, cryptographic hashing algorithm (like bcrypt, Argon2, or at least SHA-256) and never stored in plaintext.
- Consider implementing a secure key management process if encryption is necessary. Ensure that encryption keys are also protected adequately.

**Mitigation:** 
- Update the password handling process to hash passwords before storing them.
- Use cryptographic libraries to manage and implement encryption and hashing securely.

The rest of the code doesn't reveal any other obvious security defects based on the snippet provided, particularly concerning memory handling, input validation, or insecure data handling directly from the code's logic. However, it's recommended to perform a thorough audit and apply secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle to ensure security integrity.
