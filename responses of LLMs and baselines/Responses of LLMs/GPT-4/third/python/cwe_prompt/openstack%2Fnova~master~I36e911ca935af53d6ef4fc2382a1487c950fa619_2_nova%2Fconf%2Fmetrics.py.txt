After reviewing the provided code snippet, here are the findings based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards:

1. **Potential Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209)**:
    - **Line**: 41 (default value for `push_gateway`)
    - **Description**: The code snippet sets a default hostname and port for a Prometheus push gateway. If this default setting is used in a production environment, and the service at `localhost:9091` is not configured or is misconfigured, error messages that might be generated could inadvertently expose information about the internal configuration or network setup. While the code itself does not provide error handling that could lead to such exposure, the use of default settings in configuration options might indirectly result in security risks if not properly managed.
    - **Solution**: Ensure that deployments overwrite default settings with environment-specific values. Additionally, implement proper error handling that avoids disclosing sensitive information in error messages.

2. **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)**:
    - **Line**: 30 (setting for `collection_interval`)
    - **Description**: The `collection_interval` option allows negative values, specifically `-1`, to indicate a disabled state. While itâ€™s clear that `-1` is intentionally used to disable the metrics collection, allowing other negative values could potentially lead to unintended behavior or software faults if not correctly handled elsewhere in the application.
    - **Solution**: Further restrict the input validation for `collection_interval` to disallow other negative values besides `-1`. Adjust the `min` parameter to 0 for general usage and handle the special case of `-1` explicitly in the application logic.

3. **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)**:
    - **Line**: 40 (default value for `push_gateway`)
    - **Description**: The use of a hardcoded `localhost:9091` as a default value for `push_gateway` could be considered a security risk if the code automatically connects to network services without requiring explicit configuration during deployment. While not an immediate security vulnerability in the traditional sense, it could lead to misconfiguration or unintended service interactions.
    - **Solution**: Prompt the user for configuration details during installation or setup rather than relying on hardcoded defaults. This practice helps in avoiding unintentional connections to default services.

Overall, while the code does not exhibit classic security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or SQL injections, there are configurations and practices that should be improved to enhance security and avoid potential misconfigurations or information disclosures.
