No security defects are detected in the code.

The code primarily deals with mathematical operations and definitions, utilizing C++ templates and inline functions to perform various mathematical calculations such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and powers. These are standard utility functions designed for efficiency and reusability within the Qt framework, and there's no direct handling of memory management, user input, or other typical sources of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, injections, or uncontrolled format strings.

The use of `constexpr` and templates ensures that calculations can be determined at compile time whenever possible, reducing runtime overhead and potential for runtime errors related to these operations.

The use of standard libraries for mathematical functions also minimizes the risk of incorrect implementations that could lead to security vulnerabilities. The conditions checked before including or using certain functions (like checking for C++ version or library features) are standard precautions to ensure compatibility and correctness without introducing security issues.

Therefore, the code appears to be secure in the context of its intended mathematical and utility operations within the Qt framework.
