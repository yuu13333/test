No security defects are detected in the code provided.

The code snippet seems well-designed with proper use of the Qt framework's classes and methods, particularly in handling URLs, date/time, and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy attributes. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, improper input validation, or insecure use of resources based on the code excerpt provided.

The implementation adheres to best practices for managing memory and object lifecycle in C++, utilizing smart pointers (`d` pointer) for managing instances of the private data class, which helps avoid memory leaks and ensures proper cleanup. The use of `QUrl` for handling host data and its interaction with HSTS policy management seems properly encapsulated and safe from misuse.

If this snippet is part of a larger system, ensure that all interactions with external inputs are validated and sanitized appropriately, but as far as the provided code goes, it is secure.
