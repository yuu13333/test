The provided code contains a security defect related to logging sensitive information, which could potentially lead to information disclosure. Below is the detail of the defect:

1. **Logging Sensitive Information**:
   - **Affected Line**: Line 139 in `DockerDeviceProcess::start()`
   - **Issue Description**: The command being executed, along with the working directory, is logged. If this command includes sensitive parameters or if the working directory's path contains sensitive information, it could be exposed through logs, which might not be securely handled.
   - **Security Risk**: If logs are not properly secured, sensitive data exposure can lead to various security risks, such as unauthorized access or data breaches.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that sensitive information is not logged, or implement stringent access controls and encryption for log files. Evaluate the necessity of this log statement or mask sensitive parts of the output before logging.

Please review the suggestion and consider applying appropriate measures to mitigate the potential security risk.
