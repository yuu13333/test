Reviewing the provided Qt Creator code, I identified a few potential security concerns and areas for improvement:

### Potential Security Defects and Improvements:

1. **Unrestricted SDK File Permissions (Line 57-68):**
   The method `setSdkFilesExecPermission` sets executable permissions on all files in the SDK's "tools" directory that don't have a dot in their filename. This could unintentionally grant executable permissions to files that should not be executable, potentially leading to security risks if these files are malicious or get replaced by malicious ones.

   **Solution:**
   - Ensure only specific, expected files receive executable permissions.
   - Implement stricter checks to verify the identity and integrity of files before changing their permissions, possibly using checksums or digital signatures.

2. **SSL Error Handling (Line 47-55):**
   The current implementation logs SSL errors but continues processing. In a more secure context, it might be appropriate to halt or modify the operation if SSL errors occur, as they can indicate potential security issues like man-in-the-middle attacks.

   **Solution:**
   - Depending on the security needs, consider halting the download and notifying the user about SSL errors, providing them the option to either terminate the operation or ignore the errors after understanding the risks.

3. **Download Redirection Handling (Line 174-179, 190-194):**
   The method `isHttpRedirect` checks for redirection status codes, but it does not follow up with handling these redirections safely. The code logs the redirection but does not appear to take action to follow or abort based on redirection, which might lead to security issues if redirected to a malicious URL.

   **Solution:**
   - Implement safe redirection handling: Validate the new URL to ensure it's within a trusted domain or matches expected patterns before following the redirection.

4. **Error Handling During SDK Extraction (Line 109-127):**
   The `extractSdk` method does not handle extraction errors robustly. If the extraction process fails (e.g., due to corrupted files), the method simply returns `false`, but without adequate logging or user notification.

   **Solution:**
   - Improve error handling by providing detailed error messages to the user and logging these issues for debugging purposes. Consider retry mechanisms or manual intervention suggestions to the user.

5. **File System Operations Without Exception Handling (Multiple Lines):**
   Various operations like file creation, directory creation, and file writing (e.g., Lines 112, 160-171) are performed without exception handling, which could lead to unhandled exceptions if file operations fail (due to permissions, disk space, etc.).

   **Solution:**
   - Wrap file and directory operations in try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions gracefully and provide feedback or recovery options to the user.

### Conclusion
While the code shows standard practices in Qt application development, addressing the identified security and robustness issues will help in enhancing the security posture of the application. It is recommended to apply the suggested solutions to mitigate potential risks.
