After reviewing the provided code snippet from the Qt Base example, I detected a security defect related to SSL/TLS configuration:

**Defect:**
- **Line Number:** 174
- **Issue:** The code sets the SSL peer verification mode to `QSslSocket::VerifyNone`, which disables SSL certificate verification. This setting can expose the application to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks because it will not verify the authenticity of the SSL certificate presented by the server during the SSL handshake.

**Solution:**
- To address this issue, it is crucial to enforce certificate verification in production environments. The peer verification mode should be set to `QSslSocket::VerifyPeer` or another appropriate mode that requires certificate verification. Hereâ€™s a possible modification:
  
  ```cpp
  config.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyPeer);
  ```

This change ensures that the client validates the server's SSL certificate against a trusted certificate authority (CA), enhancing the security of the application's network communications.
