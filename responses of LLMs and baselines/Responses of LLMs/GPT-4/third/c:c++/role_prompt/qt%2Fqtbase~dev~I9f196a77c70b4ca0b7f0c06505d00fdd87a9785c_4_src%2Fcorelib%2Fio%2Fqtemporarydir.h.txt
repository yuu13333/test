No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code is primarily the class definition of `QTemporaryDir`, including its constructors, destructor, and methods, as well as handling of move semantics. The class ensures it cannot be copied, as evidenced by the use of `Q_DISABLE_COPY(QTemporaryDir)` to prevent potential issues like double deletion of resources. Additionally, the move assignment operator and move constructor properly transfer the ownership of the internal pointer `d_ptr`, setting the moved-from object's pointer to `nullptr`, which is a good practice to avoid dangling pointers.

The code snippet provided does not include method implementations where typical security issues such as buffer overflows or improper error handling could manifest. Since only the class interface is shown, without any method implementations or detailed handling of resources and errors, no security defects can be determined from this snippet alone. Further review would require inspection of the accompanying implementation files where the logic for methods like `remove()`, `isValid()`, and directory handling is defined.
