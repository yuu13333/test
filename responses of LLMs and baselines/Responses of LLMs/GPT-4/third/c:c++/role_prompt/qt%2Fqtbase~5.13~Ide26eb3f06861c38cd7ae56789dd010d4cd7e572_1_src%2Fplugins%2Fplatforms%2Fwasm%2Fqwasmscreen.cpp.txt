No security defects are detected in the code.

The code mostly consists of object-oriented constructs, accessor methods, and some interactions with WebAssembly via Emscripten. No critical issues like buffer overflows, uninitialized variables, or improper resource management are apparent in the provided code. The code primarily uses high-level Qt and Emscripten APIs which handle memory and type safety internally, reducing the likelihood of typical security defects.
