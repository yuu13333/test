The code you provided doesn't contain any direct security defects related to the manipulation of memory or data which would typically lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other common issues directly observable in the snippet.

However, it's essential to note that my analysis covers the actual code content you provided and not the functions' implementations or external dependencies called within. Security issues could still arise in the implementation details of the methods called or the libraries used, which are not visible in this excerpt. Therefore, a more thorough review might involve examining these external dependencies and the detailed implementation of the used methods.

Overall, from the provided excerpt:
**No security defects are detected in the code.**
