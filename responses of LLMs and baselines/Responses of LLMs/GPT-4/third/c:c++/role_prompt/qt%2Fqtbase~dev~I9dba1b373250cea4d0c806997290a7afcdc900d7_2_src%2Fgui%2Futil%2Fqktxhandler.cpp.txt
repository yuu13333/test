The provided Qt Base code appears to be well-structured and follows good programming practices generally associated with handling texture files in the KTX format. However, I identified a potential security issue related to buffer over-read, which can occur under specific circumstances:

### Issue Description:
The function `decodeKeyValues` could potentially cause an out-of-bounds (OOB) read due to improper checking of the boundaries when accessing buffer elements. This could potentially lead to accessing memory outside the buffer, leading to program crashes or leaks of sensitive memory data to an attacker.

### Affected Code:
- **Line 229**: The condition checks if the offset plus the key-value size is greater than the view size. This is intended to prevent reading beyond the buffer. However, this check is done after incrementing the offset by `sizeof(quint32)`, which can itself potentially lead to an off-by-one error if the offset increment makes the offset equal to the view size.

### Proposed Solution:
To ensure safe boundary checking and prevent potential buffer over-read issues, the boundary check should be performed before incrementing the offset. The corrected code should look like this:

```cpp
while (offset + sizeof(quint32) <= view.size()) {
    const quint32 keyAndValueByteSize =
            decode(qFromUnaligned<quint32>(view.constData() + offset));
    if (offset + sizeof(quint32) + keyAndValueByteSize > view.size())
        break; // Prevent OOB read by ensuring the entire key and value can be read safely
    offset += sizeof(quint32);
    
    // Existing code for processing key-value pairs
}
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Implementing comprehensive unit tests that check the behavior of `decodeKeyValues` under various edge cases, including minimum and maximum offsets and buffer sizes, can help catch similar issues during development.
- Review other parts of the code for similar off-by-one errors or buffer boundary issues, especially in areas dealing with raw memory access or buffer manipulation.

This issue is crucial to address as it affects the robustness and security of the application, especially considering the nature of file handling where corrupt or maliciously crafted files might be used to exploit such vulnerabilities.
