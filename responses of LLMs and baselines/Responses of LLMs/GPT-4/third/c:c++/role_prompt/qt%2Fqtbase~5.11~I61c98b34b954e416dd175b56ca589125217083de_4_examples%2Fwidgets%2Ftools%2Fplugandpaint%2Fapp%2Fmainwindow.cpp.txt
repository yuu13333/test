After thoroughly reviewing the provided Qt code, I found one potential security issue related to the plugin loading mechanism, which could pose security risks such as code injection if not properly handled:

### Security Issue
The use of `QPluginLoader` for dynamically loading plugins without proper validation or checks can be risky, particularly in environments where plugins may be provided by third-party sources.

#### Details:
- **Vulnerability:** Unsafe Plugin Loading
- **Location:** Lines 266-276

In these lines, the application loads all plugin files from a predefined directory without validating the plugins' source or integrity. If an attacker can place a malicious plugin in the directory, it may be loaded and executed by the application.

#### Recommendations for Mitigation:
1. **Validate Plugin Integrity**: Before loading a plugin, check its digital signature or hash against a list of known good values to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
2. **Limit Plugin Directory Access**: Restrict write access to the plugin directory to prevent unauthorized placement of malicious plugins.
3. **Implement Plugin Allowlisting**: Maintain a list of approved plugins and ensure only these can be loaded by checking against the list during the loading process.

### Suggested Code Modification:
To implement plugin integrity checks, you might consider integrating a checksum validation step before loading each plugin. Here's a conceptual implementation:

```cpp
// Example function to check plugin integrity
bool isValidPlugin(const QString &filePath) {
    // Function to calculate and verify plugin's checksum or digital signature
    // Returns true if the plugin is valid, false otherwise
}

// Modify the plugin loading loop
const auto entryList = pluginsDir.entryList(QDir::Files);
for (const QString &fileName : entryList) {
    QString fullPath = pluginsDir.absoluteFilePath(fileName);
    if (isValidPlugin(fullPath)) {
        QPluginLoader loader(fullPath);
        QObject *plugin = loader.instance();
        if (plugin) {
            populateMenus(plugin);
            pluginFileNames += fileName;
        }
    } else {
        // Handle invalid plugin case, such as logging an error or alerting the user
    }
}
```

This modification ensures each plugin's integrity before it is loaded into the application, enhancing the security against potential malicious code execution through tampered or rogue plugins.
