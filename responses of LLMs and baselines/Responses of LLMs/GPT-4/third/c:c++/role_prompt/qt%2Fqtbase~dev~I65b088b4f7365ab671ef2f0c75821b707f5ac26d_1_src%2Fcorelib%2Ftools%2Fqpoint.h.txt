No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code mainly involves class definitions and operations for `QPoint` and `QPointF` within the Qt framework. These classes provide functionality to handle 2D points using integer and floating-point coordinates, respectively. The operations include constructors, accessor methods, arithmetic operations, and type conversions, all marked as `constexpr` where possible to allow for compile-time evaluation.

The arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) handle basic point transformations and are implemented with care regarding the types and overflow potential. Multiplications and divisions utilize rounding functions like `qRound` to handle floating-point results properly.

The code also makes use of Qt's macro facilities for interfacing with the Qt object system and its serialization mechanisms through QDataStream. The use of `Q_ASSERT` in the division operation of `QPointF` ensures that division by zero is checked during development, thus preventing runtime errors in debug builds.

Overall, the code is well-written with attention to safety regarding arithmetic operations and interface consistency, with no obvious security issues such as buffer overflows, uninitialized variables, or risky memory management operations.
