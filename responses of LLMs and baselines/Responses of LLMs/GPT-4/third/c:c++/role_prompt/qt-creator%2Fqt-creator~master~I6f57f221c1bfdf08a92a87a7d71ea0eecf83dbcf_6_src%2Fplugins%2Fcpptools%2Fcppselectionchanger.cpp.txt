No security defects are detected in the code.

The code provided is part of a Qt Creator module for handling text selection changes within a C++ code editor. It handles various scenarios for expanding or shrinking the selection based on the structure of the C++ Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The functions manage cursor positions, selection bounds, and text manipulation without exposing any clear security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, insecure data handling, or exposure of sensitive information.

The operations mainly manipulate in-memory data structures and rely on Qt's well-tested classes (like `QTextCursor` and `QString`) to ensure proper management of memory and string operations, thus avoiding typical C/C++ issues related to low-level memory management.

If this is part of a larger code base or if you have specific security concerns not covered by the review, additional context would be needed to perform a more detailed security assessment.
