No security defects are detected in the code provided.

The code seems to be primarily focused on calendar and date manipulation within the Qt framework, and does not exhibit common security flaws such as buffer overflows, injection vulnerabilities, or improper resource management that could lead to vulnerabilities. The design leverages standard Qt data structures and practices which generally provide safety against such issues.

However, keep in mind that this review only covers explicit security defects in the static representation of the code as presented. Actual behavior during runtime could still lead to issues if the code interacts with other components in an unsafe manner, or if future modifications introduce vulnerabilities. It's also important to ensure that all user inputs or external data interacting with this system are properly validated and sanitized elsewhere in the application to prevent potential exploits through the calendar system.
