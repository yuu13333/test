No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code is a detailed implementation of various calendar systems in Qt, including proper usage of memory management, error handling, and secure programming practices. Here are some key observations:

1. **Memory Management**: The code appropriately uses `qDeleteAll(byId);` in the destructor of the `Registry` class to ensure all dynamically allocated `QCalendarBackend` objects are deleted properly (line 82).

2. **Thread Safety**: The global static mutex `calendarMutex` ensures thread-safe operations when accessing or modifying the calendar registry (line 134).

3. **Error Handling and Checks**: The code contains multiple checks for valid states before performing operations, such as in the `addCalendar` function to avoid duplicate registrations (line 87) and to ensure proper array indexing (lines 99-104).

4. **Proper Use of Assertions**: The code uses assertions to enforce certain conditions during development, such as ensuring that no calendar of type Gregorian is registered multiple times (line 107).

5. **Safe Hashing and Comparison Operations**: Custom equality and hashing functions are defined for `CalendarName` types to handle case-insensitive comparisons safely (lines 59-67).

Given these details, the code seems robust against common security issues like memory leaks, buffer overflows, and data races. The logical checks and careful handling of memory and registry operations further reduce the risk of bugs that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
