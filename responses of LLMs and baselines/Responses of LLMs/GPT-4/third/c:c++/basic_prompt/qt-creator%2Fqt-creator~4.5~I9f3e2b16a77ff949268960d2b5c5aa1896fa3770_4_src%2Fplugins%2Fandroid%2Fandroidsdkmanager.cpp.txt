After reviewing the provided code, I found a potential security issue related to subprocess management:

### Security Defect:

**Use of External Commands in Subprocess without Proper Sanitization**
- **Location:** Lines 101-111 and 119-166 describe functions `sdkManagerCommand` that execute external commands using user-input or potentially manipulated strings without explicit command sanitization or validation. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the `args` or `toolPath` are derived from user inputs or external sources that an attacker can influence.

### Explanation:
The `sdkManagerCommand` functions use `args` and `toolPath`, which are constructed from various sources throughout the code, to run a command through a subprocess (QProcess). If an attacker manages to control these inputs, they can potentially manipulate the command to execute arbitrary code.

### Suggested Solution:
To mitigate this risk, ensure that all inputs forming command arguments (`args`) or the command itself (`toolPath`) are properly sanitized, validated, and escaped before they are used in command execution. If possible, use fixed command arguments or heavily restrict the user input set to a predefined list of safe values. Additionally, consider using more secure APIs that allow for argument lists which are treated distinctly from the command itself, reducing the risk of injection.

To implement proper validation:
1. Verify that `toolPath` points to a legitimate and expected executable file.
2. Ensure that all elements in `args` are expected and safe command arguments. This could be achieved through whitelisting or pattern checks against each argument.
3. Avoid passing untrusted data directly to the command line.

This kind of validation should be implemented at all points where `toolPath` and `args` are gathered or modified.
