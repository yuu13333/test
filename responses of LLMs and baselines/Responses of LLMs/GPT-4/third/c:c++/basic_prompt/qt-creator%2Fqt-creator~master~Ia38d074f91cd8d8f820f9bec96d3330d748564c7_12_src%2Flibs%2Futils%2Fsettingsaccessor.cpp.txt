After reviewing the provided code, I identified one potential security issue related to the regular expression replacement in line 47. Here's a detailed description of the defect and a suggested solution:

**Security Issue: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)**

- **Location:** Line 47
- **Description:** The function `generateSuffix` uses `QRegExp` to replace characters that do not match the pattern `[^a-zA-Z0-9_.-]`. This function is susceptible to ReDoS if the input suffix contains specially crafted sequences that cause excessive backtracking by the regular expression engine, leading to performance degradation. This vulnerability is particularly relevant in applications where an attacker can influence the input to this function.
- **Solution:** Replace `QRegExp` with `QRegularExpression`, which offers better performance and is less prone to ReDoS vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider implementing length checks and other validations on the input string to ensure that it does not maliciously exploit the regular expression handling.

Here's the suggested replacement code for line 47:
```cpp
result.replace(QRegularExpression("[^a-zA-Z0-9_.-]"), QString('_'));
```

This change leverages `QRegularExpression`, which is designed with a different matching engine that is generally more efficient and safer for potentially hostile inputs.
