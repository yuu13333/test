No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code defines the logic for parsing and manipulating CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) encoded data, with detailed checks and validations to handle various data types and structures such as integers, strings, arrays, and maps. It thoroughly handles error states and edge cases, which is crucial for avoiding issues like buffer overflows, incorrect type handling, or other typical parsing vulnerabilities.

The use of assertions (`cbor_assert`) and detailed conditional checks to validate states and inputs before proceeding with operations minimizes the risk of undefined behaviors or crashes due to unexpected input.

The function `_cbor_value_extract_int64_helper` and related methods for advancing and checking data also appear to appropriately handle the data types and lengths, ensuring that the operations stay within the bounds of the data provided. This is critical in avoiding buffer overflows or underflows, which are common in low-level data manipulation functions.

Overall, the code implements robust error handling and validation mechanisms that are essential for secure parsing of binary data, and there are no obvious security defects based on the current code snapshot.
