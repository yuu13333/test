No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code snippet primarily includes copyright notices, license information, and declarations of the `QTemporaryDir` class, which manages temporary directories in Qt applications. The class itself, as defined here, primarily handles memory and resource management with no explicit operations that interact with external systems in a way that would typically introduce security vulnerabilities.

The methods and operators defined:
- Constructors and assignment operators ensure that resources are transferred correctly in move operations, which helps avoid resource leaksâ€”a potential security concern if left unmanaged, but properly handled here.
- Methods like `isValid()`, `errorString()`, `autoRemove()`, `setAutoRemove()`, `remove()`, `path()`, and `filePath()` are typical utility functions for managing temporary directories and do not in themselves introduce vulnerabilities.

Since this is just a declaration and does not include the actual implementation of these methods (where issues like improper path handling or permissions problems would typically arise), there are no actionable security defects evident from this review.
