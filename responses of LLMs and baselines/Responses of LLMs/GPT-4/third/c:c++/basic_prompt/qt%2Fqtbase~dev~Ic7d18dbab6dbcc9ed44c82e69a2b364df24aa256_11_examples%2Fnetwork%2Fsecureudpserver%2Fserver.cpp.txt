The code provided is a C++ implementation of a DTLS server using the Qt framework. After examining the code, I have identified a significant security defect related to the server's handling of TLS connections.

### Security Defect

1. **Disabling Peer Verification (Line 95)**
   - The code sets the peer verification mode of the `QSslSocket` to `VerifyNone` with the following line:
     ```cpp
     serverConfiguration.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyNone);
     ```
   - This configuration means that the server does not verify the identity of the clients connecting to it. Consequently, the server might accept connections from any client, regardless of whether the client has a valid certificate. This lack of verification makes the server vulnerable to various types of attacks, including man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept or modify the data transmitted between the client and the server.

### Solution
- To mitigate this security issue, it is recommended to change the peer verification mode to a more secure setting that requires clients to present a valid certificate. This can be accomplished by setting the peer verification mode to `QSslSocket::VerifyPeer` or a similar secure option, depending on the specific security requirements and the server's environment. Here is how you can update the line:
  ```cpp
  serverConfiguration.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyPeer);
  ```
- This change will enforce that all clients connecting to the server have a verified certificate, which significantly increases the security of the server by ensuring that it only communicates with authenticated clients.

Consider implementing this change to ensure the security of your DTLS server's connections.
