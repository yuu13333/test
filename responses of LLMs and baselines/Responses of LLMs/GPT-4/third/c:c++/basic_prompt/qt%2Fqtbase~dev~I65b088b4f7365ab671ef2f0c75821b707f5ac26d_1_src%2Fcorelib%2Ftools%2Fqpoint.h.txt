No security defects are detected in the code.

This C++ code primarily implements the `QPoint` and `QPointF` classes for 2D point operations in the Qt framework. The classes provide basic arithmetic operations, type conversion, and utility functions related to 2D points. All operations are marked as `constexpr` where possible to allow computations at compile time, enhancing efficiency and possibly reducing runtime errors.

The use of `noexcept` in method declarations is a good practice, indicating that these methods are not expected to throw exceptions. This can lead to better performance and more robust error handling. There is also appropriate use of `qRound`, `qAbs`, and other utilities to handle floating-point calculations safely and accurately, avoiding common pitfalls like division by zero (checked with assertions).

Overall, the provided code is well-structured and follows good coding practices for handling 2D point data, without apparent security risks or defects.
