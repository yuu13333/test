No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code snippet is a header file primarily defining a class interface and includes declarations without any actual implementation details. As such, there are no specific operations like memory management, file handling, network operations, or other areas typically associated with security defects visible in this snippet. Security analysis would require reviewing the corresponding source file where the actual behavior of these methods (like `prepareSearch`, `matchesFor`, etc.) is implemented, especially how `m_engine` (a pointer to `QJSEngine`) is utilized, which could potentially involve handling of untrusted JavaScript code execution.
