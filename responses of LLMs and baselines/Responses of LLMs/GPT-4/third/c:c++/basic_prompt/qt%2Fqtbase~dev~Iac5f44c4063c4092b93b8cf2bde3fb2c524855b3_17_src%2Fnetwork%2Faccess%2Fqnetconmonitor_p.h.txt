No security defects are detected in the code.

The code provided is primarily a header file for defining private classes related to network connection and status monitoring within the Qt framework. It includes class declarations, method signatures, and some Qt-specific macros and logging categories but does not contain any implementations or logic that directly manipulate data or interact with external systems. Here are some key observations:

- The use of default arguments in function parameters (line 72) is not inherently insecure but should be carefully managed in the implementation to ensure that it does not lead to unexpected behaviors.
- The use of signals and slots (line 80, 109, 112) is a common Qt pattern for event-driven programming and does not introduce security issues by itself.
- Memory management and object copying are controlled using Q_DISABLE_COPY_MOVE macro (lines 88, 116), which is a good practice in C++ to avoid unintended copy or move operations that could lead to resource leaks or corrupt state.

Since the code lacks any implementation details and focuses more on declarations, there are no apparent security vulnerabilities in this specific segment of code. It's essential, however, for the actual implementation to uphold security best practices, particularly in handling network data, memory management, and concurrency.
