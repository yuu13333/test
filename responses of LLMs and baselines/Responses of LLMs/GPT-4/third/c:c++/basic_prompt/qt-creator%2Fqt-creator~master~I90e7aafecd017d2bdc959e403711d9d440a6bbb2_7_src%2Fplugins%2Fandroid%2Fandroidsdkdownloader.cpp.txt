Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few potential security defects:

### 1. Inadequate SSL Error Handling (Line 47-55)
The method `sslErrors()` logs SSL errors but does not abort the network connection upon encountering such errors. This could allow the application to continue communicating over an insecure connection, exposing it to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Solution**: Modify the `sslErrors` method to reject the connection when an SSL error occurs. This can be achieved by calling `abort()` on the network reply object associated with the SSL errors.

### 2. Executable File Permissions (Line 57-68)
The function `setSdkFilesExecPermission()` automatically sets executable permissions on files without performing any checks other than whether the file name contains a dot. This can be dangerous if any of the downloaded files are malicious, as it could potentially facilitate the execution of arbitrary code.

**Solution**: This operation should be more cautious. It's important to ensure that only trustworthy files are set as executable, possibly by verifying the file source, checking file hashes, or confining permissions changes to a more strict set of file patterns (e.g., known executable names).

### 3. Potential Resource Leak (Line 120-124)
The method `extractSdk()` uses a `QProcess` to extract the SDK but does not properly manage the memory of `QProcess` instances. If `extractSdk()` is called multiple times, it could lead to memory leaks.

**Solution**: Use smart pointers (e.g., `QScopedPointer` or `std::unique_ptr`) for automatic memory management of `QProcess` instances. Alternatively, consider reusing a single `QProcess` instance across the `extractSdk()` calls or ensuring proper deletion after the process completes.

### 4. Unhandled Redirection (Line 174-179)
The `isHttpRedirect()` method detects HTTP redirections but does not handle them, potentially leading to situations where the downloader does not follow redirects, resulting in failed downloads or unexpected behavior.

**Solution**: Implement redirection handling by making a new network request to the URL provided in the `Location` header of the HTTP response when a redirect status code is detected.

### Recommendations:
- Ensure SSL connections are secure and handle errors appropriately to prevent data leaks.
- Be cautious with file permissions, especially when dealing with downloaded content.
- Use memory management techniques to prevent leaks when using dynamic memory allocation.
- Properly handle HTTP redirections to ensure the downloader fetches the intended content.
