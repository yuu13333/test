No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code is a definition and implementation of classes `QLine` and `QLineF` from the Qt framework, which represent line segments using integer and floating point coordinates, respectively. The classes include constructors, methods for manipulation and comparison, and serialization capabilities.

The functions are largely straightforward, involving basic arithmetic and assignment operations, and do not involve any complex memory management, user input directly affecting memory or execution flow, or interactions with external systems that could pose security risks. The use of `QPoint` and `QPointF` for point representation also relies on well-defined behavior within the Qt framework, and the operations on these types are used correctly within bounds.

Additionally, the code does not exhibit typical security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or improper error handling. The computations and transformations are encapsulated within the Qt type system, reducing the risk of incorrect memory access or data leakage.

Overall, this code is focused on data representation and geometric calculations without exposure to external input or interaction that might introduce security vulnerabilities.
