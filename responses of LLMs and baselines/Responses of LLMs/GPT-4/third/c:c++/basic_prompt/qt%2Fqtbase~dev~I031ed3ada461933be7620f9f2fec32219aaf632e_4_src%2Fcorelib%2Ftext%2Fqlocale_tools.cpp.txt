No security defects are detected in the code provided.

The code includes a variety of functions for converting between numbers and strings, managing character and string operations in different bases, and dealing with floating-point numbers in a locale-independent way. The functions make use of bounds checking and error handling appropriately to prevent common issues like buffer overflows, uncontrolled format strings, and improper handling of special floating-point values like NaN and infinity. Each operation that involves potentially risky actions, like memory allocation or pointer arithmetic, includes checks and validations to ensure safety.

The usage of modern C++ features and libraries (e.g., `std::from_chars` and `QVarLengthArray`) helps improve safety and performance by relying on well-tested standard mechanisms rather than custom implementations. Additionally, functions use assertions (`Q_ASSERT`) and condition checks to ensure the integrity of operations.

Overall, the code demonstrates good practices in handling conversions and numeric operations with an emphasis on safety and correctness in a low-level context.
