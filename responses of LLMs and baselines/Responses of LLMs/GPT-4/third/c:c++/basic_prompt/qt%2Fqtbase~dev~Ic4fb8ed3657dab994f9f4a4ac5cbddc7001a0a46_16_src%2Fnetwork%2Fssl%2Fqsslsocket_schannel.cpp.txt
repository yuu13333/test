No security defects are detected in the code provided. The code mostly deals with setting up and managing SSL/TLS connections using Schannel on Windows, and handles various aspects of the connection lifecycle, including initializing, creating, accepting, and closing SSL contexts, as well as handling encryption, decryption, and renegotiation processes.

It's well-structured to manage and use certificates, handle errors, and configure SSL/TLS protocol versions appropriately. Additionally, it includes error handling and logging which aids in diagnosing issues but does not exhibit direct security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, injection flaws, or improper error handling that would compromise security.

Keep in mind that the effectiveness of security measures largely depends on how well the rest of the system (including hardware and other software layers) is secured and whether best practices are followed, such as keeping the system and its components up to date.
