The code provided is largely secure and well-structured, following best practices for memory and resource management, particularly in the handling of move semantics and state cleanup. However, there is a minor concern related to the use of `std::memmove` in line 56:

**Potential Security Issue:**
- **Line 56**: The use of `std::memmove` for copying internal state data within the `State` class could potentially be hazardous if not handled properly. The function `std::memmove` is used safely here because it correctly anticipates self-assignment, ensuring that the data overlap is managed correctly. However, using `std::memmove` still requires careful consideration of the size and type of the data being moved to avoid buffer overflows or other memory-related issues.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Although the current usage of `std::memmove` in this context is secure, it's always a good practice to encapsulate such operations within more robust error-checking and validation frameworks to prevent future errors if the code is modified. An explicit check to ensure that the sizes and boundaries are respected before the memory operation can add an extra layer of security.
- Furthermore, documenting the requirements and assumptions of such memory operations in the code comments can help maintainers understand the potential risks and necessary conditions for safe operation.

Overall, the security of the code appears robust, with specific attention already given to issues like resource management and proper function cleanup in destructors and move operations. The use of `std::memmove` is correct in this scenario, but caution should be maintained for future code modifications or extensions.
