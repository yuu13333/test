No security defects are detected in the code provided.

The code seems well-structured and designed with standard programming practices for handling HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policies in Qt. It primarily involves getters and setters for policy attributes like expiry dates, host names, and subdomain inclusion, and there are no obvious security flaws such as buffer overflows, improper error handling, or insecure data transmissions that can be identified from the snippet provided.

However, it's worth noting that thorough security analysis often requires deeper context, such as how these methods are utilized across the broader application, any external inputs that affect these values, and the overall security model of the application. But based on the given segment alone, there are no apparent security defects.
