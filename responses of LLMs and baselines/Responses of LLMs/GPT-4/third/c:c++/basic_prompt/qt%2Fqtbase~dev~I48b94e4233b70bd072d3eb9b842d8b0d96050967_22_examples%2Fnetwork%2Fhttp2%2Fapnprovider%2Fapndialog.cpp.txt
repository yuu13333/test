After reviewing the provided code, I identified one notable security defect:

**Security Defect:**
- **TLS Peer Verification Disabled (Line 174)**: The code sets the peer verification mode of the SSL/TLS connection to `QSslSocket::VerifyNone`. This configuration disables the verification of the SSL/TLS certificate presented by the server, which means the client will not verify whether the server's certificate is valid. This leaves the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept or alter communications between the client and server.

**Solution:**
- **Enable TLS Peer Verification**: To mitigate this vulnerability, the peer verification mode should not be set to `VerifyNone`. Instead, it should use a more secure setting like `QSslSocket::VerifyPeer` to ensure that the server's certificate is properly verified during the SSL/TLS handshake. This can be implemented by changing the line 174 to:
  ```cpp
  config.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyPeer);
  ```

This change ensures that the client validates the server's certificate according to the CA certificates that the client trusts, enhancing the security of the communication channel.
