Upon reviewing the provided code, which is a comprehensive implementation of the `QRect` and `QRectF` classes in Qt, I found no specific security defects directly related to issues like buffer overflows, injections, or other common security vulnerabilities. The implementation focuses on geometric manipulations and properties, using safe operations within the bounds of the types and the logic defined.

However, there are some general considerations to keep in mind, although these do not directly translate into security defects:
- **Integer Overflow**: Operations like addition and multiplication with `int` types could potentially overflow, especially if the rectangle dimensions or positions are extremely large. This is mostly a theoretical concern in the context of normal GUI operations where such extreme values are unlikely.
- **Precision in Floating Point Arithmetic**: The `QRectF` class, which uses floating-point numbers, might introduce precision errors. This isn't a security concern per se but can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled or considered, especially in graphical computations where exact precision might be crucial.

Both issues are primarily concerns in application logic and robustness rather than security vulnerabilities. The use of `noexcept` specifier extensively suggests that the methods are not expected to throw exceptions, which is good for performance and safety in terms of preventing unexpected program exits due to thrown exceptions.

**Conclusion:**
No security defects are detected in the code. The design and implementation appear robust from a security standpoint, focusing on geometric operations with adequate type safety and error handling through the use of `noexcept`. Any potential issues would likely be more relevant to functionality and correctness rather than security.
