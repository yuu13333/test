No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code is the header file part of a C++ class (`QTemporaryDir`) from the Qt library, which is designed to manage temporary directories. This header file declares the class and its member functions but does not contain the implementation details, which are typically found in a corresponding source (.cpp) file.

Here, the class is designed with typical C++ best practices such as:
- Using `noexcept` for move constructors and move assignment operators to signal that they do not throw exceptions.
- Using `QScopedPointer` for managing memory (indicated by the type `QTemporaryDirPrivate *d_ptr`) which helps in managing resource deallocation automatically.
- The `Q_DISABLE_COPY(QTemporaryDir)` macro call prevents copying of the object, which is a common strategy to avoid unintended resource duplication and potential memory issues.

Without the implementation details of functions like `isValid()`, `remove()`, `setAutoRemove()`, etc., and without knowing how `QTemporaryDirPrivate` is implemented, it's hard to comment on specific security issues like improper handling of file operations, path traversal, or resource leaks. However, based solely on this header file, there are no apparent security defects.
