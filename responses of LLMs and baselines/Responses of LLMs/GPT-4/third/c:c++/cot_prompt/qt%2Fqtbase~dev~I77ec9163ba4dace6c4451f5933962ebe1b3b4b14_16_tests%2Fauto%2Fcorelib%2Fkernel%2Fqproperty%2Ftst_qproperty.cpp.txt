After analyzing the provided C++ code, which primarily involves the use of Qt's property binding features, I found no explicit security defects within the code. The code sample is focused on testing various aspects of property bindings in Qt and does not involve any typical security-critical operations such as network communication, file I/O, or handling of untrusted input that might lead to common security issues like buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting.

The use of lambda functions for property bindings and the manipulation of properties through Qt's framework-specific features (like `QProperty<int>`) are typically safe as they are managed within the confines of Qt's well-tested object and memory management paradigms. The code adheres to standard memory management practices recommended by Qt, using `QScopedPointer` for automatic memory management, which helps prevent memory leaks.

### Details:
1. **Memory Management**: The use of `QScopedPointer` for managing dynamically allocated memory ensures that memory is properly released when the pointer goes out of scope, preventing memory leaks.
2. **Binding Implementations**: The lambda functions used in property bindings do not capture external data unsafely and operate within the bounds defined by their closure. Therefore, there are no risks of dangling pointers or use-after-free vulnerabilities in the way lambdas are used here.
3. **Property Handling**: The operations on `QProperty` objects are encapsulated within Qt's type-safe system, reducing the risk of type mismatches or improper memory access.

### Conclusion:
**No security defects are detected in the code**. The properties and their bindings are managed using Qt's mechanisms designed to ensure safety in memory and type management. However, it's always recommended to maintain vigilance during further development and integration, particularly if external inputs or resources become involved or if the properties are extended to handle more complex data types or interactions.
