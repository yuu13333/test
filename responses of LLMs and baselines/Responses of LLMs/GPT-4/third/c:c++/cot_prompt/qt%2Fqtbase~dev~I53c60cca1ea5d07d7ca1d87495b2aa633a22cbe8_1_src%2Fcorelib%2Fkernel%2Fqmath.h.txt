The provided code primarily deals with mathematical operations using basic data types and standard libraries, so it has a relatively low risk profile for security defects. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Buffer Overflows and Underflows**: The code does not perform operations that involve direct memory management or manipulation of arrays, strings, or buffers that could lead to buffer overflows or underflows.

2. **Integer Overflows and Underflows**: The code includes casts and operations between different numerical types (e.g., casting `qreal` to `int`), but they appear in controlled scenarios that shouldn't overflow given normal input ranges of mathematical functions. The operations use 64-bit integers to safely handle the conversion of floating-point numbers to integers without the risk of overflow.

3. **Use of Uninitialized Variables**: All variables used in the mathematical functions are either passed as parameters or are well-defined within the function scope, so there's no use of uninitialized variables.

4. **Floating-Point Errors**: While not typically security defects, inaccuracies in floating-point calculations can lead to unexpected behavior. However, the code is designed to handle typical mathematical operations, and any minor inaccuracies in floating-point arithmetic do not pose security risks.

5. **Null Pointer Dereference**: There are no pointers used in the provided mathematical functions, eliminating the risk of null pointer dereferences.

6. **Improper Error Handling**: The mathematical functions do not include explicit error handling code because they rely on the behavior of standard library functions like `std::ceil` and `std::floor`, which are designed to handle all input cases defined for floating-point numbers according to IEEE standards.

7. **Code Injection or Execution**: There are no executable code paths or script executions that could be manipulated externally; the code is strictly computational.

8. **Race Conditions**: Since the functions are stateless and do not involve shared mutable state, there is no risk of race conditions.

**Conclusion**:
No security defects are detected in the code. The code primarily uses standard library functions and straightforward arithmetic operations, which are typically safe from common security vulnerabilities. The use of compiler directives and conditional compilation also ensures that the correct code paths are executed for the specified hardware capabilities, without introducing additional risks.
