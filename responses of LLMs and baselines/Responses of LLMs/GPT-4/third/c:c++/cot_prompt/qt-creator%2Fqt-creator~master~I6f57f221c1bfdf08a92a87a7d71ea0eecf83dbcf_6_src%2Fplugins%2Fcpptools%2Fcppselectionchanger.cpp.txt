After reviewing the provided code for potential security defects, here are the considerations:

### Code Review
The code primarily deals with text cursor manipulation within a document editor context, specifically within the Qt Creator environment. It involves operations such as getting and setting positions within a document, querying and adjusting selections based on AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes, and handling various selection directions and sizes.

### Security Considerations
The key areas that generally could be prone to security issues in such a context include:
1. **Buffer Overflows and Underflows**: Risky when dealing with direct memory access or manipulations based on index calculations.
2. **Dereferencing Null Pointers**: Common in environments where pointers are used without sufficient checks.
3. **Infinite Loops**: Can be triggered if conditions for terminating loops are not guaranteed to be met.
4. **Improper Input Validation**: Crucial where input from outside the application (like user input or file data) is used without validation.

### Analysis
Upon analyzing the provided code, here are the key findings:
- **Buffer Overflows and Underflows**: The code handles document positions and selections through high-level Qt APIs (`QTextCursor`, `QTextDocument`), which internally manage safety checks against buffer overflow and ensure that the operations are bounds-checked.
- **Dereferencing Null Pointers**: The function `isDocumentAvailable` (lines 105-111) properly checks for nullity of the document pointer before proceeding, preventing potential null dereferences.
- **Infinite Loops**: The loop within `performSelectionChange` (lines 972-1002) relies on the return value of `findNextASTStepPositions` and conditions on the direction of selection (expansion/shrinking) to break. The loop appears to be controlled adequately by the selection's state and boundaries.
- **Improper Input Validation**: Most of the input to the methods seems to be derived from internal calculations and document states managed by Qt. While direct user input isn't evidently processed in the exposed methods, ensuring that all cursor positions derived from external sources or user inputs are validated before use would be prudent.

### Conclusion
**No security defects are detected in the code**. The code generally uses high-level Qt functions and classes that encapsulate rigorous checks and safety measures internally. Nonetheless, it's always recommended to remain vigilant about how external inputs are handled and to ensure that conditions leading to loop terminations or recursive calls are robust against unusual or unexpected values.
