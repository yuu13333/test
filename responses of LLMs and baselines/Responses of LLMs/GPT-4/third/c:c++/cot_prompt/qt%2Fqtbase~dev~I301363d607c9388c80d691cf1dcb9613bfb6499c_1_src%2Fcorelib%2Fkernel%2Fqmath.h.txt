Upon analyzing the original code provided, which is mostly related to mathematical operations and utility functions for C++ programming using the Qt framework, I focused on common security concerns such as buffer overflows, memory leaks, integer overflows, and misuse of pointers. The code, however, largely consists of template functions, inline functions, and constexpr expressions, which are inherently safer due to their compile-time evaluation and lack of direct memory management by the programmer.

Key areas of focus included:
- **Boundary Checking**: The `QHypotHelper` class and other mathematical functions donâ€™t explicitly manage memory or handle data from untrusted sources, which reduces the risk of buffer overflow or underflow.
- **Type Safety**: The use of templates ensures type safety in mathematical operations.
- **Resource Management**: There is no dynamic memory allocation or manual resource management, thus minimizing the risk of memory leaks or dangling pointers.

Specific examination points:
- **Mathematical Functions**: Operations like `qHypot` and utilities like `qNextPowerOfTwo` are implemented using standard library functions or constexpr logic, which should prevent typical numeric errors such as overflows or underflows provided that inputs are within normal operational limits for their respective data types.
- **Template Functions**: These increase safety by enforcing type correctness and reducing the risk of misinterpretations of data types.
- **Global Constants and Macros**: Defined constants such as `M_PI` and others are used safely within calculations without modifications.

Given this analysis, I can conclude:
```No security defects are detected in the code```.

This determination is based on the static analysis of the provided code snippet. For more rigorous assurance, especially in different contexts or with larger, interconnected systems, dynamic analysis and thorough testing would be required to identify potential runtime issues.
