To analyze the provided code for security defects, I've reviewed key areas that are commonly associated with security issues such as memory management, pointer usage, thread safety, and proper handling of user inputs or external data. Here's a summary of the review:

1. **Pointer Dereferencing (Lines 148, 204, 347, 659)**:
   - The code checks if the pointer is non-null before dereferencing, which is good practice to avoid segmentation faults. For example, in the destructor of `QPixmapCache::Key` and various other places, there's a check before decrementing the reference count or deleting the object.

2. **Memory Management**:
   - The use of `new` and `delete` appears to be well-managed with corresponding checks and balances. There's appropriate cleanup in destructors and error handling paths. Memory allocated for `keyArray` is freed in the destructor and `clear()` method of `QPMCache` (Lines 270, 459), which helps prevent memory leaks.

3. **Thread Safety (Lines 107, 509, 528, 561, 583, 599, 632, 642, 656, 669)**:
   - The cache operations are guarded by `qt_pixmapcache_thread_test()` to ensure they are only executed in the main thread of the application, which is crucial for preventing race conditions and other concurrency issues in a multi-threaded environment.

4. **Integer and Buffer Overflows**:
   - The handling of integer sizes and calculations like in `cost()` function (Line 99) uses `qsizetype`, which is appropriate for preventing overflows when dealing with large pixmap sizes.

5. **Use of Static and Global Functions (Line 484)**:
   - The use of `Q_GLOBAL_STATIC` with `QPMCache` ensures that there is only one instance of this cache object, mitigating issues with multiple instantiations that could lead to inconsistent states or memory leaks.

6. **Error Handling and Robustness**:
   - There are several checks for the validity of keys and objects before proceeding with operations like removing or accessing cache entries. These checks prevent operations on invalid or stale data, which is a good defensive programming practice.

Based on this review, **no specific security defects are detected in the code**. The code appears to be conscientiously developed with attention to memory management, thread safety, and error handling, which are critical areas for securing application behavior in a library used for caching like QPixmapCache.
