Upon reviewing the provided code for the `QCalendar` backend registration, several areas were scrutinized for potential security defects, including race conditions, improper locking mechanisms, resource leaks, and memory management issues. Here are the findings:

### Analysis Results

**1. Race Conditions and Concurrent Access**
- The code uses a `QBasicMutex`, `registryMutex`, to protect shared resources like the backend registration mappings and status flags. The use of scoped locks (`qt_scoped_lock`) at critical sections, such as when accessing or modifying the registry's internal data structures (`byId` and `byName`), helps prevent race conditions. This is handled correctly throughout the registry's methods, such as in lines **109** and **125**.

**2. Atomic Operations**
- The use of `QAtomicPointer` and `QAtomicInteger` for the `gregorianCalendar` and `status` respectively (lines **89** and **90**) ensures that reads and writes to these variables are atomic. This prevents inconsistencies during read-modify-write operations across different threads.

**3. Memory Management**
- The `Registry` destructor (lines **97-102**) deletes the registered backends, ensuring there are no memory leaks from backends registered in the `byId` vector. Each backend is deleted appropriately, preventing resource leaks.
- The correct use of memory management is evident where a new calendar backend is created (lines **173-191**). The code checks if the backend is registered correctly before returning it (lines **202-204**). If registration fails, the backend is deleted, preventing memory leaks.

**4. Exception Safety**
- The use of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) with `qt_scoped_lock` ensures that the mutex is always released when leaving the scope, even if an exception occurs, which is crucial for preventing deadlocks.

**5. Error Handling**
- The registry checks if it is in a destructing state before allowing new registrations (line **108**). This prevents operations on an invalid state of the registry, though it's based on the assumption that any such attempt is an error.

### Conclusion

No overt security defects related to concurrency, resource management, or data integrity are detected in the provided code. The usage of mutexes, atomic operations, and careful memory management strategies are appropriate for ensuring the safe and correct function of the calendar backend registration system in a multi-threaded environment.

Hence, I conclude: **No security defects are detected in the code**.
