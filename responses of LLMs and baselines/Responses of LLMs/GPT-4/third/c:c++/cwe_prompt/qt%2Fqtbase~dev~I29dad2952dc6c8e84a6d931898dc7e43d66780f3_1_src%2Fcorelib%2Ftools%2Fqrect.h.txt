No security defects are detected in the code.

The code provided defines the `QRect` and `QRectF` classes, handling rectangular areas with integer and floating-point coordinates, respectively. It includes methods for setting dimensions, moving, and adjusting rectangles, and operators for combining rectangles through union and intersection operations. It adheres to good coding practices relevant to the functionality it provides, and no security vulnerabilities related to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards are evident in the code segment. 

The functions and methods are marked with `noexcept`, suggesting they do not throw exceptions, which is appropriate for geometric calculations and state manipulations depicted. Additionally, the use of inline and constexpr for performance optimization is correctly applied without compromising the code's integrity.
