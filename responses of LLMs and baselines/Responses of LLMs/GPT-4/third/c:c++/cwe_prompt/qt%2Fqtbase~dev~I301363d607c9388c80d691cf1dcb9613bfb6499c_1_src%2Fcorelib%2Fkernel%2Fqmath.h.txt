After reviewing the provided code for security defects using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard, I have found no significant security defects. The code primarily consists of mathematical function templates and utility functions that work with mathematical constants and trigonometric calculations. These functions are typical in mathematical libraries and, in this context, do not interact with user inputs, external systems, or perform operations that would typically expose the system to security risks such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, or improper access controls.

Here is a summary of potential concerns that were considered and found to be non-issues:

1. **Buffer Overflows**: The code does not include operations that manipulate buffers or arrays in a manner that could lead to buffer overflow. The use of `std::` functions and constexpr calculations are well within safe bounds.

2. **Integer Overflows**: The template functions and calculations do not involve arithmetic that risks integer overflow under normal usage, especially since most operations are performed on floating-point numbers or involve static mathematical constants.

3. **Floating Point Errors**: While floating-point calculations can introduce precision errors, these are not security defects but are inherent to floating-point arithmetic.

4. **Side-Channel Vulnerabilities**: The mathematical functions shown, such as trigonometric and logarithmic calculations, do not involve conditional branches or memory accesses that depend on secret values, thus not prone to timing attacks in the context given.

5. **Improper Input Validation**: Since the functions operate on template types and are mathematical in nature, the scope for input validation issues is minimal unless the calling code misuses the functions. However, the code snippet itself does not directly deal with user inputs or external data processing.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and does not exhibit any common security vulnerabilities as per the CWE listing. Thus, I would state: 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
