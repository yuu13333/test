After reviewing the provided code, there are a couple of potential security issues, categorized under CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration):

1. **Use of Uninitialized Resource (CWE-908)**:
   - **Line 170**: The code declares a `QByteArray buffer(size, Qt::Uninitialized);` which is intended to be filled with data from an `ArrayBuffer` using the `destinationTypedArray.set(sourceTypedArray);` method. However, if for any reason the `set` operation does not fully initialize the buffer with expected data, parts of the buffer may remain uninitialized and subsequently be used, leading to unpredictable behavior.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the buffer is properly initialized before use or verify that the `set` operation fully populates the buffer.

2. **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)**:
   - **Lines 267, 268**: The `memcpy` operation is used to copy data from `d->downloadBuffer.constData()` to `data` for the number of bytes specified by `howMuch`. There is an assumption that `maxlen` (the capacity of the destination buffer) will always be equal to or greater than `howMuch`. If this is not the case, a buffer overflow could occur.
   - **Solution**: Add checks to ensure that `maxlen` is sufficient to hold `howMuch` bytes before performing the copy operation.

3. **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)**:
   - **Lines 369, 370**: The code splits `formEntry` on '=' to separate keys and values for form data. There is no explicit handling or validation to ensure that each `formEntry` contains a '=' character or that it results in exactly two substrings (key and value). If a malformed entry is processed, it could lead to incorrect data handling or application crashes.
   - **Solution**: Validate `formEntry` to ensure it contains exactly one '=' and splits into exactly two parts before accessing the substrings as key and value.

These issues represent potential risks based on the code as reviewed, and addressing them would improve the robustness and security of the codebase.
