After reviewing the provided code, I have identified a potential security defect associated with the reallocation of the `keyArray`:

### CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write

**Line Number:**
- Line 405 involves a reallocation of memory for `keyArray` using `realloc`.

**Explanation:**
- The `realloc` function is used to resize the memory block pointed to by `keyArray` to a new size in bytes. If the reallocation fails, `realloc` returns `NULL` and the original memory block remains untouched. However, if the code proceeds to use the new `keyArray` pointer without checking if `realloc` succeeded, it might lead to a situation where a `NULL` pointer is dereferenced, causing a program crash, or worse, it could corrupt memory if it writes through an invalid pointer.

**Solution:**
To mitigate this issue, it is crucial to check if `realloc` has returned `NULL` before proceeding to use the new pointer. Hereâ€™s how you can adjust the implementation:

```cpp
keyArray = reinterpret_cast<int *>(realloc(keyArray, size * sizeof(int)));
if (!keyArray) {
    // Handle the error, for example by logging the failure and returning from the function
    qDebug() << "Failed to reallocate memory for keyArray.";
    return;
}
for (int i = keyArraySize; i != size; ++i)
    keyArray[i] = i + 1;
keyArraySize = size;
```

By adding a check after the `realloc` call, you ensure that the `keyArray` pointer is valid before accessing it, preventing potential out-of-bounds write errors and improving the overall robustness of the code against memory allocation failures.
