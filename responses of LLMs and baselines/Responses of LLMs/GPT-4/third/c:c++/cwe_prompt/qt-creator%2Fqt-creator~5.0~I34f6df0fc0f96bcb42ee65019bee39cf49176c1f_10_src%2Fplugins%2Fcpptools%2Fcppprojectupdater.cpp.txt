No security defects are detected in the code based on the provided segment and considering the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard. The code appears to primarily handle task scheduling and synchronization within the Qt project environment, using futures and signal-slot connections which are typical in Qt applications and do not inherently introduce security vulnerabilities.

The code utilizes `QPointer` to manage pointers to `ExtraCompiler` objects, which is a good practice to prevent use-after-free errors (CWE-416). The usage of `QFutureInterface` and `QFutureWatcher` to manage asynchronous operations also appears to be handled safely, with appropriate checks for cancellations and completions, preventing potential race conditions (CWE-362).

If the code interacts with external systems or processes untrusted input, it would be important to review those specific interactions for security implications, but based on the current code snippet, no direct security issues are apparent.
