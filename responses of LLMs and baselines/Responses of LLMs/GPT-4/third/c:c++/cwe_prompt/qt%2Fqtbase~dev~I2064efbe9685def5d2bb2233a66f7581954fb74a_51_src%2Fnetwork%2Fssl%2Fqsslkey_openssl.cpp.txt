After thoroughly reviewing the provided code, specifically focusing on security aspects and potential vulnerabilities according to the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards, I identified several security defects. Here are the details:

### 1. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
- **Location:** Line 91
- **Description:** The code uses the pointer `pkey` directly without validating that it is not NULL before accessing it. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if `pkey` is ever NULL.
- **Solution:** Add a check to ensure `pkey` is not NULL before accessing it.

### 2. CWE-416: Use After Free
- **Location:** Lines 166, 172, 179
- **Description:** The variable `rsa`, `dsa`, or `ec` might be used after being freed in the function `clear` which can be called before these lines in the program flow. If `deepClear` is true and any of these objects are previously freed, then reusing them could lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities.
- **Solution:** Ensure proper lifecycle management of these variables, potentially by resetting their values after calling `clear()` or revalidating their existence.

### 3. CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
- **Location:** Lines 230, 243, 257
- **Description:** The password is potentially transmitted in cleartext when it's used to encrypt the private key if a weak cipher (or no cipher, if the passphrase is empty) is selected. This might allow an attacker to eavesdrop on the network and retrieve the passphrase.
- **Solution:** Ensure strong encryption methods are enforced, and avoid offering an option for no encryption.

### 4. CWE-200: Information Exposure Through Debug Information
- **Location:** Line 52 (Conditionally compiled with QT_NO_DEBUG_STREAM not defined)
- **Description:** If compiled without `QT_NO_DEBUG_STREAM` defined, it might include sensitive debugging information that could help an attacker gain insight into the system or application's internal workings.
- **Solution:** Ensure that sensitive information is never logged or that the debug logs are appropriately secured and sanitized.

These issues are critical to address to maintain the integrity and security of the SSL/TLS key handling within the application. Ensuring these points are corrected would significantly improve the robustness of the security implementation in the code.
