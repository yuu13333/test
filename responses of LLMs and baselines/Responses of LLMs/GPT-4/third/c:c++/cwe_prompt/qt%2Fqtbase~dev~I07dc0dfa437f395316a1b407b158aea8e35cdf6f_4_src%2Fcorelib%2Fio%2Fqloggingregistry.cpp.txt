No security defects are detected in the code provided.

The code sample primarily deals with logging configurations and parsing rules, without direct handling of external inputs or sensitive data operations that typically present security vulnerabilities. The code ensures that potential logging configurations are parsed correctly and applied within defined parameters. It uses rigorous condition checks and maintains a clear separation between data processing and application logic.

Furthermore, the functions related to file reading (like `loadRulesFromFile`) and logging configuration settings (such as `parseNextLine`) are encapsulated within their respective classes and namespaces, providing a structured approach to handling configurations without evident security risks such as buffer overflows, command injections, or improper access controls.
