After reviewing the provided code, I have identified a potential security defect concerning the use of unvalidated input that might affect the system's integrity and confidentiality. This defect relates to CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.

**Description of the Issue:**
- The function `readPatch` (line 43) processes patch data from an input string without explicitly checking the content's validity before using it. This might lead to processing of specially crafted patch data that could exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or unauthorized information disclosure if the patch processing involves insecure operations.

**Security Defect Location:**
- Line 43: `static void readPatch(QFutureInterface<QList<FileData>> &futureInterface, const QString &patch)`

**Proposed Solution:**
- Ensure that the patch data is validated against a well-defined format before processing. Employ regular expressions or similar validation techniques to verify that the patch content adheres to expected patch formats.
- Consider implementing additional security checks within the `DiffUtils::readPatch` function or ensure that it is robust against malformed or malicious input data.
- Optionally, use security mechanisms like sandboxing or privilege separation when processing untrusted input data to mitigate potential impacts on the system.

By addressing these concerns, you can enhance the security of the application against potential exploitation through crafted patch data.
