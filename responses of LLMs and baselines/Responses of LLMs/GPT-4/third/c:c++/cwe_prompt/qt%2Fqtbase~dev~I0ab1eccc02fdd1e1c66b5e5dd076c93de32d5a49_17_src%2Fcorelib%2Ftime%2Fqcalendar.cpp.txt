No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code primarily deals with managing various calendar systems in a registry, handling their registration, and providing access to their properties. It employs careful use of locks to manage concurrency, uses assertions to ensure integrity during development, and adheres to safe practices for handling pointers and dynamic memory. The code does not appear to involve network operations, user input directly affecting memory management, or operations on external systems which are typical areas for security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of modern C++ idioms, like smart pointers and RAII for managing locks, reduces the risk of memory leaks or deadlock scenarios. 

The implementation shown is focused on internal logic and data integrity rather than external threat vectors, thus, based on the information available and the nature of the operations in the code, no CWE-referenced security defects are detected.
