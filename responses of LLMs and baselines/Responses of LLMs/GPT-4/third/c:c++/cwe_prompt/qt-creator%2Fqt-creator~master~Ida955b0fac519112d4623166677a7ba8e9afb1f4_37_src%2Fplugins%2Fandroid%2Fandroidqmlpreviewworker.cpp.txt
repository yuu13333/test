Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified potential security defects related to Command Injection and Sensitive Data Exposure. Here are the details:

### Command Injection

**Affected Lines:** 98-110, 122-127, 419-440, 443-463, 465-474

The functions `runAdbCommandAsyncAndWait`, `runAdbCommand`, `runAdbShellCommand`, `uploadFiles`, `runPreviewApp`, and `stopPreviewApp` take strings from variables and construct command line arguments that are executed on the system shell. These commands include user-controlled input (`dev`, `arguments`, `transfer.uploadPackage.baseName()`, etc.), which may allow an attacker to inject additional shell commands.

**CWE-77**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
**Solution**: Validate and sanitize all inputs used in shell commands to ensure they do not contain shell metacharacters or use APIs that can execute commands without invoking a shell.

### Sensitive Data Exposure

**Affected Line:** 71

The function `ApkInfo::ApkInfo()` initializes `uploadDir` with a hardcoded path that includes sensitive application identifiers. This data could inadvertently expose details about the filesystem structure or internal implementation details to an attacker.

**CWE-312**: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Solution**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in the source code. Use environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive data, and ensure they are encrypted or access-controlled.

### Recommendations:

1. **Sanitize Inputs:** Always validate and sanitize inputs that are used to construct system commands to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
2. **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for storing sensitive or environment-specific data instead of hardcoding them in your source files.
3. **Security Auditing:** Consider employing tools that perform static code analysis to detect security vulnerabilities in the codebase.

These changes should help mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture of the application.
