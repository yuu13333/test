After reviewing the provided code, which appears to be an implementation of a QPoint and QPointF class for Qt, I did not detect any specific security defects directly related to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards.

The implementation primarily consists of basic arithmetic operations and getters/setters for point manipulation, and it follows good practices like ensuring operations are marked as `noexcept` where applicable. However, there are a few general considerations and potential improvements unrelated to security that could be noted:

1. **Floating-point Division by Zero (Line 414)**:
   - The line `Q_ASSERT(divisor > 0 || divisor < 0);` is used to guard against division by zero before performing the division on lines 416-417. Although not a security defect, this is crucial for avoiding runtime errors.
   - As a safeguard, this approach is correct and necessary to prevent undefined behavior which could potentially be exploited in a different context where error handling is not as robust.

2. **Usage of `qRound` in Multiplication and Division (Lines 207-208, 214-215, 228-229, etc.)**:
   - The use of `qRound` ensures that the results are integers. It's a safe operation in this context but should be well-documented to ensure users understand the rounding effects on their calculations.

3. **Integer Overflow (Various lines)**:
   - Operations like `xp += p.xp;` and similar could potentially lead to integer overflow. While generally not an immediate security concern in this context because the overflow behavior of signed integers in C++ is undefined but typically benign, in other contexts or in safety-critical applications, it might be worth implementing checks or using types that handle overflows explicitly.

4. **Usage of Assertions**:
   - The use of `Q_ASSERT` ensures certain conditions are met during development (like in line 300 and line 415). It's crucial to note that assertions are typically disabled in production builds, so alternative error handling strategies should be considered for release versions to prevent erroneous behavior in the field.

In conclusion, the code does not contain security defects that correspond directly with CWE entries, as the potential issues noted above are more about program safety and correctness rather than security vulnerabilities.
