No security defects are detected in the code provided based on a review against the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. The code primarily handles bitwise operations and memory management within the confines of the QBitArray class, and does not involve operations commonly associated with security vulnerabilities such as handling of external input, execution of untrusted code, or network operations. The use of functions like `memset` and `memcpy` are adequately bound-checked in this context, which minimizes the risk of buffer overflows.

However, it's important to ensure that any modifications or extensions of this code maintain safe memory management practices and validate any external inputs if applicable in future use cases.
