No security defects are detected in the code based on the provided content.

The code provided consists mainly of class declarations and definitions related to dialog helpers for the Qt platform. These classes handle various dialog settings like colors, fonts, files, and messages using options and configurations typical for GUI components. Most of the functionality revolves around the UI interaction logic, including setting options, handling user input, and displaying dialogs.

Most security concerns in such a context would relate to handling user input or managing resources, but the provided code snippet does not include implementations of methods where such issues typically occur (e.g., buffer management, input validation, or file handling operations). Therefore, without more detailed method implementations or context regarding how these classes interact with external systems, no specific Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) vulnerabilities can be identified from the header declarations alone.
