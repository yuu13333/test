No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to be consistent with good practices in C++ and Qt for managing thread concurrency and memory. All concurrency and object lifecycle operations are appropriately handled using QtConcurrent, QMutex, and similar constructs. Each operation ensures proper memory management, preventing issues such as memory leaks, race conditions, or unintended data modification across threads.
