After reviewing the provided code with the context of security practices, there is a notable security defect related to how the application handles network broadcasting:

**Security Defect: Unrestricted Broadcast of Network Data (CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume)**

**Lines Affected: 96-97**

This section of the code involves the sending of UDP datagrams to a broadcast address, which can lead to several security and operational issues:

1. **Network Saturation**: Broadcasting data at regular intervals without checks or control mechanisms can consume excessive bandwidth and may saturate the network, which could disrupt the normal function of other applications and services sharing the same network.
2. **Potential for Amplification Attacks**: Since the code is broadcasting messages, it might be used for amplification in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks if the application or device can be coerced into broadcasting large amounts of data.

**Suggested Remediation:**

1. **Limit Broadcast Frequency and Volume**: Implement controls to limit the frequency and volume of the broadcast data. For example, adding a condition to check if the broadcasting is indeed necessary based on application logic or external configurations could help.
   
2. **Configuration Options for Broadcast**: Allow configuration settings to manage whether broadcasting should be enabled, and under what conditions, including the ability to set broadcast addresses dynamically.
   
3. **Authorization and Authentication**: Ensure that the feature is available only to authenticated and authorized users if applicable, especially in environments where network resources are critical.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging to monitor the usage of this broadcast functionality. This can help in identifying potential abuse or operational issues related to this feature.

By addressing these issues, you can mitigate the risks associated with network saturation and potential misuse in amplification attacks.
