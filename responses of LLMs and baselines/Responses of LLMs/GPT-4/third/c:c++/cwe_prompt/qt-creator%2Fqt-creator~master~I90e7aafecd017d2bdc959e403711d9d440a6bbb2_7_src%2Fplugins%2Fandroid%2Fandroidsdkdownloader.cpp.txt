After reviewing the provided code for the `AndroidSdkDownloader` class, I found several potential security defects based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. Here are the issues along with their details:

### CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Lines:** 84-105
**Description:** The network communication handling in the `downloadAndExtractSdk` method (lines 84 and following) does not explicitly ensure the use of a secure connection (HTTPS) for downloading sensitive data, such as the Android SDK. The use of QNetworkRequest does not guarantee that HTTPS is used unless the URL explicitly specifies it.
**Solution:** Verify that `sdkUrl` uses an HTTPS scheme or enforce HTTPS in the URL construction to ensure data is encrypted during transmission.

### CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
**Lines:** 84-105, 157-172
**Description:** The downloaded SDK is saved to disk and executed without verifying its integrity (no checksum validation or digital signature verification is performed). This could lead to the execution of tampered or malicious code.
**Solution:** Implement checksum verification or digital signature validation of the downloaded SDK package before it is saved and extracted. This can be done by comparing the computed checksum of the downloaded file with a trusted checksum provided via a secure channel.

### CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
**Lines:** 57-68
**Description:** The method `setSdkFilesExecPermission` indiscriminately adds executable permissions to files within the SDK directory without checking if these files should be executable. This could potentially lead to the execution of malicious or unintended scripts or binaries.
**Solution:** Review and apply executable permissions only to files that are required to be executable. Validate the types of files and their intended use before changing their permissions.

### CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Lines:** 84
**Description:** The method `downloadAndExtractSdk` uses a user-supplied URL (`sdkUrl`) to perform a network request. If not properly validated, this could be exploited to send requests to unintended locations, potentially leaking sensitive information or accessing unauthorized services.
**Solution:** Validate the `sdkUrl` to ensure it points to a trusted and expected destination. Employ a whitelist of allowed domains from which SDKs can be downloaded.

### General Improvement
**Lines:** 121-125
**Description:** The process of extracting the SDK is done by invoking an external command (`jar`) which could be susceptible to command injection if `jdkPath` or `m_sdkFilename` are not properly sanitized.
**Solution:** Ensure that `jdkPath` and `m_sdkFilename` are properly sanitized to prevent any possible command injection. Use parameterized APIs for process creation if available.

These issues should be addressed to enhance the security and reliability of the `AndroidSdkDownloader` functionality in Qt Creator.
