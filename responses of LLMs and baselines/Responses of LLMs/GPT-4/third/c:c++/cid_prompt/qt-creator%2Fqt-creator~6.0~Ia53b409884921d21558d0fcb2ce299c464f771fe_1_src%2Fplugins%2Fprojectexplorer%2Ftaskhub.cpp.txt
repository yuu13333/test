After reviewing the code provided, I have identified a potential security defect that falls under CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):

1. **Singleton Instance Management (Lines 124 and 131)**:
   The code uses a static pointer (`m_instance`) to manage a singleton instance of the `TaskHub` class. This pattern is susceptible to lifecycle issues:
   - **Issue**: The `m_instance` pointer is set to `nullptr` in the destructor of `TaskHub` (line 131). If any function attempts to access `m_instance` after it has been destroyed but before the program has terminated, it will be dereferencing a null pointer, leading to undefined behavior and potential crashes.
   - **Solution**: To mitigate this, ensure that all accesses to `m_instance` check for `nullptr` before dereferencing. Alternatively, consider using a smart pointer (like `std::shared_ptr`) to manage the lifecycle of the singleton instance more safely. This would help in automatically managing the memory and would avoid leaving dangling pointers.

No other direct security defects from the specified CWE categories seem to be present in the code. However, it is essential to conduct thorough testing, especially focusing on concurrent access and destruction scenarios, to ensure the robustness of the singleton implementation in a multi-threaded environment.
