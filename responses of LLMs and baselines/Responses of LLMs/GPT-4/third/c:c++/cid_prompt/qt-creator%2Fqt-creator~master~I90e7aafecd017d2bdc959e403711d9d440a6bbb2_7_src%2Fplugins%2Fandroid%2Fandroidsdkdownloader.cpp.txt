After reviewing the provided code, several potential security defects were identified. Here are the defects according to the specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types:

1. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
    - **Line 120**: The `QProcess` object `jarExtractProc` is dynamically allocated with `new` and never explicitly deleted. This could lead to memory leaks if not managed properly.
    - **Solution**: Use `QScopedPointer` for automatic memory management, or ensure `delete` is called after the process is no longer needed.

2. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**:
    - **Lines 145-149**: The function `getSaveFilename` uses a potentially problematic method for generating a unique filename by appending numbers. This method may not be efficient or reliable, especially under concurrent access scenarios or if the number of files grows large.
    - **Solution**: Consider using a more robust method to generate unique filenames, such as UUIDs or timestamp-based approaches.

3. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**:
    - **Line 116**: The construction of the command for `jar` utility involves direct concatenation of user-controlled input (`jdkPath`). If `jdkPath` is not properly validated, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
    - **Solution**: Validate and sanitize `jdkPath` before use, or use more secure methods to construct command lines, such as those that involve array-based process invocations which treat the command and its arguments as separate entities.

4. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**:
    - **Line 63**: The check for executables does not consider files without an extension as potential executables (it only sets execute permissions if the file has no dot). This is based on an unreliable assumption about what constitutes an executable file and could inadvertently set execute permissions on non-executable files.
    - **Solution**: Use a more reliable method to determine file types, possibly by checking file headers or using a predefined list of executable file types.

5. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**:
    - **Lines 122-123**: The method `waitForFinished` is used without checking if the process started successfully. If the `jar` command fails to start, the method might behave unexpectedly.
    - **Solution**: Check the return value of `start()` to ensure the process has started correctly before calling `waitForFinished()`.

Each of these security concerns should be addressed to improve the robustness and security of the software. Adjustments and further code reviews may be necessary to fully secure the application against these and potentially other vulnerabilities.
