After reviewing the provided code, no specific security defects relating to the enumerated Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) were detected. Here's a summary of the observations:

1. **Improper Access Control (CWE-284)**: The code does not exhibit explicit instances of improper access control regarding resources or system functionality. Access to views and models seems appropriately managed through class methods and instances.

2. **Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities (CWE-435)**: There is no apparent improper interaction between multiple entities that could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. The interactions between different views and the design document are structured and follow expected software design principles.

3. **Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime (CWE-664)**: The management of resource lifetimes, particularly with respect to view objects (`std::unique_ptr` for view management), appears to be handled correctly, preventing resource leaks or dangling pointers.

4. **Incorrect Calculation (CWE-682)**: The code does not involve complex calculations or algorithms where numerical errors could be introduced. Most operations pertain to UI management and event handling.

5. **Insufficient Control Flow Management (CWE-691)**: The control flow throughout the code seems logical and adequate without premature exits or erratic jumps that could leave the program in an inconsistent state.

6. **Protection Mechanism Failure (CWE-693)**: There are no evident failures in protection mechanisms within the provided code. The code primarily deals with UI component management rather than direct security mechanisms.

7. **Incorrect Comparison (CWE-697)**: All comparisons and conditional checks in the code seem to be used as intended, with correct operators and logic to ensure proper execution flow.

8. **Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-703)**: The code does not explicitly handle exceptions in many parts, but this is common in environments where exceptions are not the primary error handling mechanism (such as in many UI frameworks).

9. **Improper Neutralization (CWE-707)**: There's no processing of external input that could lead to injections or other forms of attacks typically associated with improper neutralization.

10. **Improper Adherence to Coding Standards (CWE-710)**: The code adheres to common coding practices for the environment it's intended for (Qt/C++), with clear structuring and appropriate use of the language features.

Thus, based on the provided code snippet and the CWE categories focused on, **no security defects are detected in the code**. However, this does not preclude the possibility of other types of bugs or non-security-related issues.
