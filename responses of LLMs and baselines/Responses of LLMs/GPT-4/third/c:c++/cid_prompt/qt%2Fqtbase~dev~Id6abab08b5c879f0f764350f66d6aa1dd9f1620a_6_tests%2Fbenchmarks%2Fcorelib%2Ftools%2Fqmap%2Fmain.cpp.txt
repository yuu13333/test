Upon reviewing the provided code, I identified one significant issue that pertains to **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**. This defect occurs specifically in the `insertion_string_int` function:

- **Lines 145-146**: When using the `QStringList names` generated by `ucs4lloWorld(100000)`, there is an incorrect calculation for indices. `names.at(i)` will throw an `out_of_range` exception when `i` reaches `99999` because `QStringList` indexing starts from `0`, and `QStringList.at(99999)` tries to access an element at an index that does not exist (`names` has indices ranging from `0` to `99998`).

To correct this, you should adjust the loop to iterate from `0` to `< 99999` instead of starting from `1` and going to `< 100000`. Here's the updated loop code for correction:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 99999; ++i)
    map.insert(names.at(i), i);
```

This modification ensures that the loop correctly aligns with the indices in `names` and avoids an out-of-range access, thereby resolving the potential for an `out_of_range` exception which disrupts program execution.

No other specific security defects pertaining to the mentioned CWE categories were detected in the rest of the code.
