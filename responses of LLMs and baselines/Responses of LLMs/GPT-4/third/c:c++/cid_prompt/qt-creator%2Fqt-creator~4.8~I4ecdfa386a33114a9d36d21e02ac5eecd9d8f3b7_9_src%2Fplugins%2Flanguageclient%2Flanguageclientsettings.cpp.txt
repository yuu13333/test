After reviewing the provided code, I've identified a few potential security defects related to CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) and CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization).

1. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - **Issue**: The code frequently manages memory for `StdIOSettings` objects through raw pointers, which are dynamically allocated and deallocated in various parts of the code (lines 211-227, 277-279, 305-314, 335-344). The use of raw pointers for managing dynamic memory increases the risk of memory leaks, especially if exceptions occur between allocation and deallocation.
   - **Solution**: Use smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr` or `QScopedPointer`) instead of raw pointers to automatically manage the lifecycle of these objects. This approach minimizes the risk of memory leaks and ensures proper resource cleanup.

2. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
   - **Issue**: The executable and arguments for a client are set from user input or settings without visible checks or sanitization (lines 526-534). If the input or settings are compromised or improperly validated, this could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands.
   - **Solution**: Implement input validation and sanitization for the executable and arguments. Ensure that only valid executables and safe arguments can be used. Additionally, consider employing a whitelist approach where only pre-approved executables can be used.

These issues are crucial from a security perspective, particularly in environments where the configuration can be influenced by external inputs or users. Proper management of resources and validation of inputs are fundamental practices to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure the security and stability of the application.
