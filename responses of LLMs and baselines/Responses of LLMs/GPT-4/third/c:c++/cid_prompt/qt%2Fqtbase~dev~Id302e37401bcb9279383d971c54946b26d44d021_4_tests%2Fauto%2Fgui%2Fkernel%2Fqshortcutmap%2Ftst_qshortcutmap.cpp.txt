The provided code includes a security defect related to **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**. This defect is specifically related to the management and lifetime of resources, in this case, the `QObject` which acts as a shortcut owner.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Lines 88-93**: A `QObject` is created and immediately used as the owner for a new shortcut via `QGuiApplicationPrivate::instance()->shortcutMap.addShortcut(...)`. Shortly thereafter, the `QObject` is deleted with `delete badOwner;`. However, the shortcut created using this owner is not explicitly removed before the owner's deletion.

    This is a critical issue because the deletion of `badOwner` leads to a situation where the shortcut map retains a reference to a destroyed object, potentially leading to undefined behavior or crashes when the shortcut system tries to interact with this now-invalid owner object.

### Solution
To resolve this issue:
- Ensure that shortcuts are explicitly removed from the `QShortcutMap` before their owners are deleted. This can be achieved by calling a method to remove the shortcut that references the owner just before the owner is destroyed.
- Alternatively, ensure that the owner's lifecycle is managed so that it outlives its usage in any shortcuts, potentially by using smart pointers or other lifecycle management mechanisms to prevent premature deletion.

By correcting this, you will adhere to proper resource management practices, thus mitigating the risk associated with improper control of a resource through its lifetime.
