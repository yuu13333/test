After reviewing the provided code snippet, I did not detect any significant security defects related to the listed CWE categories (CWE-284 to CWE-710). The code appears to manage resources, permissions, and error handling appropriately in the context given.

However, it's important to note that security assessments can be limited by the context provided, and the actual usage of these functions in the broader application might reveal more about their security posture. Always ensure proper testing, including static and dynamic analysis, in a full application context to uncover potential security issues.
