Upon reviewing the provided C++ code, I found potential security defects related to CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization) and CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions). Here are the details:

### CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)

**Issue:** The function `validateFilter` (Line 38) checks if the input from a text box is a valid GTest filter but does not neutralize or encode potential dangerous inputs that might be used to inject unwanted commands or data. Since it directly uses `edit->text()` which is user input, it could potentially lead to security issues if the input is not properly sanitized elsewhere in the program.

**Solution:** Ensure that all user inputs are sanitized and neutralized for potentially dangerous content before they are used in a context where they could cause harm. This could involve escaping special characters, enforcing strict input validation rules, or using libraries designed to handle user input safely.

### CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)

**Issue:** In the `apply` function (Line 68), there is a conditional check at line 90 which compares the current settings with old settings and returns if they are the same. However, this check is done after the new settings have already been applied (Line 88). This means any effects from setting new values are not reverted if the settings were supposed to be unchanged based on the condition at line 90.

**Solution:** The check to determine if the settings have changed should be performed before applying the new settings. This would avoid unnecessary operations and potential side effects if the settings are not actually changed. The conditional check should be moved before Line 88.

These issues highlight the importance of carefully managing user input and program flow to prevent unintended behavior and ensure security.
