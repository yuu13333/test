After reviewing the provided code snippet, it appears there are no explicit security defects related to the specified CWE categories:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** - There's no evidence of improper access control mechanisms as the code primarily defines class structure and member functions without specific access control implementations beyond typical C++ access specifiers.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)** - The code does not show interaction between unrelated or unsynchronized entities that could lead to issues.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)** - The management of resource lifetime is handled carefully, especially with the destructor in `QStringConverter` (line 139) and the move semantics in the `State` class (line 42 and line 50).

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)** - The code does not perform complex calculations that could be prone to errors.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)** - Control flow seems to be managed effectively, with proper checks for null pointers and handling of state transitions.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)** - There are no specific protection mechanisms implemented that could fail, as this code is more about data conversion and management rather than security enforcement.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)** - There are no comparisons in the provided code snippet that could be considered incorrect or insecure.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)** - The code includes checks for valid state and manages exceptional conditions appropriately, especially in the handling of dynamic interface destruction (line 141).

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)** - This category usually pertains to input validation and neutralization issues (e.g., SQL injection, XSS), which are not applicable to this backend conversion-focused code.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)** - The code adheres to common C++ coding standards and idioms, particularly in its use of modern C++ features like `noexcept`, move semantics, and optional return types.

Thus, no security defects are detected in the code based on the provided CWE categories.
