The code provided is part of the QPoint and QPointF class implementations for a library, presumably Qt based on the licensing and naming conventions. Upon review, I've identified a few potential issues that could be categorized under the CWE specifications mentioned:

### CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation
1. **Line 66:** The `transposed()` method in the `QPoint` class uses uninitialized variables `yp` and `xp` instead of `y()` and `x()`. This results in using garbage values, leading to incorrect calculations when attempting to transpose the coordinates. 
   - **Solution:** Modify line 66 to use `y()` and `x()` instead of `yp` and `xp`. Corrected line: `return {y(), x()};`

2. **Line 258:** Similar to the issue in the `QPoint` class, the `transposed()` method in the `QPointF` class uses uninitialized variables `yp` and `xp`. This leads to a potential misuse of uninitialized values.
   - **Solution:** Modify line 258 to use `y()` and `x()` instead of `yp` and `xp`. Corrected line: `return {y(), x()};`

### CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
1. **Lines 300 and 415:** The `operator/` in both `QPointF` and `QPoint` checks if `divisor` is non-zero using `Q_ASSERT`. However, `Q_ASSERT` is only active in debug builds, meaning in release builds, division by zero will lead to undefined behavior if it occurs.
   - **Solution:** Replace `Q_ASSERT` with an if condition that throws an exception or handles the zero divisor case gracefully in release builds as well.

### CWE-707: Improper Neutralization
1. **General Concern:** The use of `qRound` in multiplication and division operations across `QPoint` and `QPointF` classes (e.g., lines 207, 208, 214, 215, etc.) could potentially lead to rounding errors or integer overflow if the inputs are not validated or if the scaling factor is unusually large.
   - **Solution:** Implement checks to validate the range of inputs (both `factor` and `divisor`) before performing operations, and consider using safer methods or libraries to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.

These are the main issues based on the code provided and the CWE categories listed. It's important to address these concerns, especially when dealing with a widely-used library like Qt, where reliability and correctness are paramount.
