The provided code is a part of a calendar system, handling the registration, interaction, and properties of various calendar backends. Here's an assessment of potential security defects based on the categories provided:

### CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
- **Issue**: The destructor of `QCalendarBackend` (lines 88-97) removes entries from `s_calendars` using a loop that continues until `dead` equals `s_calendars.end()`. This could potentially be inefficient and prone to errors if modifications to the container are not handled correctly.
- **Solution**: Ensure that the destruction process is atomic and safe from concurrent modifications, possibly by locking or using thread-safe containers if concurrency is a factor.

### CWE-707: Improper Neutralization
- **Issue**: The function `registerCalendar` (lines 454-463) checks if a name is already used before registering a new calendar. There's a potential race condition where the check (`s_calendars.contains(name)`) and the insertion (`s_calendars.insert(name, this)`) are not atomic, leading to possible duplicate entries if called concurrently.
- **Solution**: Use a thread-safe mechanism or lock the resource during the check and insertion to ensure atomicity.

### CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
- **Issue**: In several places, the code assumes that certain properties or operations are valid without explicitly checking if the related objects or conditions are valid. For example, methods in `QCalendar` rely on the backend pointer (`d`) without checks (e.g., lines 592-594, 600-602).
- **Solution**: Add null checks or assertions before accessing the backend pointer to avoid dereferencing null pointers.

### CWE-284: Improper Access Control
- **Issue**: The global static map `s_calendars` is used to store calendar backends and accessed across different parts of the program (line 39). This could lead to unauthorized access or modifications if the access controls are not properly enforced.
- **Solution**: Ensure that access to `s_calendars` is properly controlled, possibly by making it private and accessing it through getter/setter methods that enforce access controls.

### CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation
- **Issue**: The method `daysInYear` (lines 182-184) performs a calculation to determine the number of days in a year but does not consider input validation for unusual or invalid year values.
- **Solution**: Add validation checks for the year input to ensure that calculations are performed on valid data.

### CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
- **Issue**: Many methods assume successful operations without handling potential errors or exceptional conditions. For example, the method `registerCalendar` does not handle the scenario where the calendar name is an empty string, which is only asserted but not handled in a production environment (line 456).
- **Solution**: Implement comprehensive error handling and checks for exceptional conditions, especially where data might be invalid or operations might fail.

### Conclusion
While the code handles basic calendar functionalities well, attention should be given to thread safety, error handling, and ensuring that operations on shared resources are performed atomically to prevent security and stability issues.
