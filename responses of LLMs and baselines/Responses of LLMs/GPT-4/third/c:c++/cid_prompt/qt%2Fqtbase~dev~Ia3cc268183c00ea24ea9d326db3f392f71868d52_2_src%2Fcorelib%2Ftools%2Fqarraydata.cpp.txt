After reviewing the provided code, no security defects related to the specified Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories are detected. Here's a breakdown of potential concerns evaluated against the listed CWE types and the corresponding analysis:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: There are no specific access control mechanisms directly implemented in this code, as the functions primarily handle memory allocation and deallocation within a managed framework (Qt).

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: The functions seem to be well-contained with appropriate checks (e.g., overflow checks in lines 94-95) to ensure there are no unintended interactions that could lead to memory corruption.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: Resource management appears to be handled correctly. The allocation (lines 161-170) and deallocation (lines 232-241) functions ensure that resources are managed without apparent leaks or misuse.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: The code includes checks for overflow in calculations (lines 94-95), which is crucial in preventing incorrect memory allocation sizes that could lead to security issues.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: Control flow, particularly in relation to error handling and overflow prevention (e.g., returning -1 in lines 96 and 98 if conditions fail), is adequately managed.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: The code does not show signs of failing to implement necessary protection mechanisms. Adequate checks and balances are used, especially concerning memory operations.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: The comparisons made throughout the code (e.g., overflow and underflow checks) are appropriate for their contexts, ensuring that operations such as memory allocation do not proceed under erroneous conditions.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: The code includes checks for exceptional conditions like overflow and returns appropriate error signals (e.g., returning -1 in cases of detected overflow).

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: This category typically relates to neutralizing issues in string handling or input validation. Since the code primarily deals with memory size calculations and allocations, it is not directly applicable here.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The code follows good coding practices expected in a mature framework like Qt, including proper documentation, consistent use of assertions for debugging (lines 91, 175, 177, 236), and structured error handling.

Given this analysis, no specific security defects related to the provided CWE categories are identified in the code.
