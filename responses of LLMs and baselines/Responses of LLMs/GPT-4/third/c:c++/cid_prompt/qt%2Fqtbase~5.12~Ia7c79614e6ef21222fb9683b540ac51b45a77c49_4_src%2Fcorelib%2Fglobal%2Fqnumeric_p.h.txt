The code provided is a complex implementation that involves numerical operations and checks, especially in relation to floating-point and integral types. Upon review, I did not detect any security defects related to the listed Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) such as improper access control, interaction between multiple entities, resource management, incorrect calculations, control flow management, protection mechanism failure, incorrect comparison, exception handling, neutralization, or adherence to coding standards.

Here is a brief analysis:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: No issues detected. The code does not handle user permissions or authentication that would typically be associated with access control.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: No issues detected. The functions are well encapsulated and there is no improper interaction that could lead to unforeseen behaviors.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: No issues detected. The code does not manage resources such as memory or file handles directly, which might otherwise be improperly managed.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: No issues detected. The calculations performed (especially conversions and mathematical checks) are bounded and checked appropriately.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: No issues detected. The functions include appropriate control structures for the operations they are performing.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: No issues detected. The code does not directly involve mechanisms like encryption, access controls, or other protection measures that could fail.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: No issues detected. Comparisons, especially in mathematical functions like `isnan`, `isinf`, and `isfinite`, are performed according to standards.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: No issues detected. The conditions are checked appropriately, with fallbacks where necessary.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: No issues detected. The context of the code does not involve input/output operations that could be manipulated.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: No issues detected. The code adheres to apparent coding standards, using templates, type traits, and proper namespaces.

Given the complexity of the code, especially in handling numeric types and conversions, it appears well-constructed with due consideration to potential overflow, underflow, and type safety issues. The use of compiler intrinsics and built-in functions to prevent overflows in arithmetic operations further supports this assessment.
