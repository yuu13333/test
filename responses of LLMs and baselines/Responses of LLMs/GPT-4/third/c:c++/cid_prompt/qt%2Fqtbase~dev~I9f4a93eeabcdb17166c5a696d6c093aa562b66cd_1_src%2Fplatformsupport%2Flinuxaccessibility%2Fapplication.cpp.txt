After reviewing the provided code, there is one potential security defect related to **CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**, specifically in the handling of event objects:

**Issue Detail:**
The code includes a mechanism for managing keyboard event objects in a queue and processing these events asynchronously via DBus messages (lines 187-195 and 210-235). The events are queued before being sent to an external listener (`NotifyListenersSync`), and depending on the success or failure of this notification, the events are either deleted or re-posted to the application's event system.

**Problematic Scenario:**
- The `notifyKeyboardListenerCallback` method (line 210) deletes the `QKeyEvent` object if the DBus message callback indicates successful handling (`event.second` is deleted on line 219).
- However, if the DBus call fails and returns an error in `notifyKeyboardListenerError` (line 227), the same `QKeyEvent` objects are not deleted immediately but are re-posted to the event queue of the application (lines 233-234). This could potentially lead to improper management of memory or event objects, particularly if these objects are modified or deallocated elsewhere in the application, leading to undefined behavior or crashes.

**Solution:**
To ensure proper control and management of these event resources, consider implementing a more robust cleanup mechanism. Specifically:
1. Ensure that `QKeyEvent` objects are consistently deleted or handled appropriately across all branches of the code, including error handling paths.
2. Use smart pointers (e.g., `QSharedPointer`) for automatic memory management of event objects to prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers.

By adjusting these aspects, the code can achieve more reliable and secure resource management, mitigating the risks associated with improper control of resource lifetimes.
