The code provided for the `QHstsPolicy` class, which manages HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policies, does not appear to have explicit security defects related to the CWE categories specified. Below is an analysis in terms of these categories:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: There is no evident improper access control within the code as it primarily deals with data encapsulation and manipulation within the `QHstsPolicy` class itself.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: The code does not exhibit improper interactions between multiple entities. The class interactions pertain to proper use of the Qt framework's classes like `QDateTime`, `QString`, and `QUrl`.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: The resource management in the class is handled appropriately, with no misuse of memory or other resources. The use of `QHstsPolicyPrivate` pointer and proper copy/move semantics indicates careful management of the class's internal state.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: There are no calculations performed that would raise concerns of being incorrect.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: The control flow within the class methods is straightforward and does not exhibit any logic errors or unhandled conditions that might affect the control flow integrity.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: There is no indication of a failure in any protection mechanism. The class is designed to enhance security by managing HSTS policies, not compromise it.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: The operator overloading for comparison (`operator==`) is correctly implemented to compare all relevant internal state variables of the `QHstsPolicyPrivate` class, suggesting an appropriate comparison logic.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: All class methods that need to check for conditions (like validity of an expiration date) appear to do so correctly.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: The code does not handle external input directly where neutralization would be a concern. Usage of `QUrl::setHost` suggests that it adheres to Qt's parsing standards which should handle any peculiarities in host naming.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The code adheres to typical C++ and Qt coding standards and conventions, indicating a well-structured and maintained codebase.

Thus, based on the provided code and these CWE categories, **no security defects are detected in the code**.
