The provided code segment is mostly related to class and method declarations, and without implementation details of the methods like `widget()`, `apply()`, and `displaySettingsChanged`, it's challenging to fully evaluate many security concerns, particularly those associated with runtime behavior such as improper handling of access controls, resource management, and control flow.

However, based on the declarations and descriptions given, the following assessments can be made with respect to the listed Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs):

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: Without method implementations, it's hard to determine if there are any access control issues. The use of `private` for some member variables suggests an understanding of the need for encapsulation.
   
2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: There are no interactions between multiple entities shown that could be assessed for issues.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: The use of `QScopedPointer` for `m_widget` (line 49) is a good practice for managing the lifetime of resources, ensuring the widget is deleted when the `MinimapSettingsPage` object is destroyed.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: There are no calculations present in the visible code.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: This would typically involve issues in managing the flow of an application, like failing to handle states or conditions correctly. Again, without implementation details, this cannot be assessed.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: There is no visible implementation of any protection mechanisms, so this cannot be assessed.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: There are no comparisons in the provided code segment.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: Exception handling cannot be evaluated without the actual method implementations.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: Typically related to neutralizing inputs in a security context (like SQL injection, XSS), which is not applicable here as no input handling is visible.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The code adheres to basic coding standards of C++ as seen in the naming conventions and use of classes/objects.

In conclusion, **no security defects are detected in the code segment provided** due to the lack of implementation detail. It's advisable to inspect the implementations of `widget()`, `apply()`, and `displaySettingsChanged` for a more thorough security review.
