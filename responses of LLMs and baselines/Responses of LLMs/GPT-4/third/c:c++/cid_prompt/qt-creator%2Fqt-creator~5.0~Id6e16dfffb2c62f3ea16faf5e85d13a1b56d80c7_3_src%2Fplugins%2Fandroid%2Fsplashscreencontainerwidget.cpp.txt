After reviewing the provided code, I did not find any significant security defects directly related to the mentioned CWE categories. However, I'd like to highlight a few areas where best practices could be improved, potentially mitigating future risks:

1. **File Path Handling**:
   - The code uses a series of hardcoded file path constants for image paths and XML files (e.g., lines 48-59). While this in itself is not a security flaw, the manner in which paths are constructed (lines 410, 548, 566) could potentially be manipulated if any part of the `manifestDir` or other dynamically added path segments can be influenced by external input. It's recommended to rigorously sanitize any paths that are constructed using external input to prevent path traversal attacks.

2. **File I/O Operations**:
   - The code handles file operations without explicit error handling (e.g., lines 410-434, 548-589). While there are checks for file existence and basic error handling in XML reading, it would be beneficial to implement more robust error handling around file I/O operations to prevent issues that could lead to denial of service or incorrect application behavior if file operations fail.

3. **XML Handling**:
   - The handling of XML data in functions like `loadSplashscreenDrawParams` (lines 410-434) does not indicate any specific safeguards against XML-related attacks such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. Although Qt handles XML parsing with default settings that are generally safe, it's good practice to explicitly disable external entity processing when configuring XML parsers, especially if the XML files might come from untrusted sources.

4. **Dynamic UI Updates**:
   - The functions for dynamically updating UI components based on file operations and settings changes (e.g., lines 510-525) should ensure that all updates are properly synchronized with the UI thread to prevent inconsistencies and race conditions.

While the code primarily deals with local resource management and UI configuration without direct indications of external interaction vulnerabilities, adhering to secure coding practices, particularly in handling file paths, file I/O, and XML data, is crucial to maintaining the security integrity of the software.
