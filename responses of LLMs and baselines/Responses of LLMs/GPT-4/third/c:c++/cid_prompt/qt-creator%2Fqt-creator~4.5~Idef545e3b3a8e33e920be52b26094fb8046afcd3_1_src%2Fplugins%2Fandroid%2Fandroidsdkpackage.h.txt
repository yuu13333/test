After reviewing the provided code, no specific security defects related to the given Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers are detected. The code is primarily concerned with the structure and management of Android SDK packages and system images within a software environment. Here's a brief analysis based on the CWEs mentioned:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** - The code does not show explicit mismanagement of access controls. Access modifiers like `public`, `protected`, and `private` are used appropriately to encapsulate the properties of the classes.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)** - There are no obvious interactions between multiple entities that would lead to security defects.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)** - The resource management primarily handles version numbers and file paths without evident mismanagement. The destructors and constructors are not explicitly shown but the default behavior in C++ and the use of smart pointers (like `QPointer`) for managing dependencies suggest proper control.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)** - No calculations are performed that are obvious or critical from a security perspective.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)** - The methods and their overrides seem to be well-defined without evident flaws in control flow management.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)** - No explicit security protection mechanisms (like encryption, authentication) are handled in this code snippet, hence no failures in this context.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)** - The comparisons made, such as in the overloaded `<` operator, are meant for sorting or order-based logic and do not imply security-related comparisons.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)** - Exception handling is not explicitly covered in this snippet, but no operations here are obviously risky or exception-prone beyond typical usage.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)** - There are no operations involving input/output that would require neutralization to prevent things like injection attacks.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)** - The code follows good C++ and Qt programming practices as seen in the structuring and API usage.

In conclusion, this code segment appears well-constructed for its intended functionality with no overt security defects as per the provided CWE identifiers.
