Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a potential security defect:

1. **Potential Command Injection Vulnerability**: The functions `mount_volume` and `umount_volume` are vulnerable to command injection attacks due to the way the command to be executed is constructed using user-controlled or external input (`volume` and `mnt_base`).

For example:

- Line 47-54: The command to mount the Quobyte volume is constructed using the `volume` and `mnt_base` arguments, which may come from untrusted or external sources. If an attacker can control or manipulate these values, they might inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with root privileges because of the `run_as_root=True` argument in the `utils.execute` call.

- Line 66: The command to unmount the Quobyte volume is constructed using the `mnt_base` argument.

**Solution**:

All user-controlled or external inputs should be validated and sanitized before they are used in constructing commands to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

One way to mitigate this risk is by ensuring that the values of `volume` and `mnt_base` do not contain any malicious characters, especially spaces and shell metacharacters (`;`, `&`, `|`, etc.). A strict validation and whitelisting approach can be used to ensure that these values conform to expected formats or patterns.

Additionally, when constructing commands that will be executed, avoid concatenating or interpolating user-controlled data directly. Instead, use mechanisms that allow you to pass arguments separately from the command, ensuring they are treated as data rather than part of the command. 

The `utils.execute` function from the Nova codebase does this by accepting command arguments separately, so ensure that values like `volume` and `mnt_base` are passed as separate arguments and not concatenated or embedded within other strings. 

This way, even if an attacker provides a value with spaces or other special characters, they will not be able to break out of the intended command's context.
