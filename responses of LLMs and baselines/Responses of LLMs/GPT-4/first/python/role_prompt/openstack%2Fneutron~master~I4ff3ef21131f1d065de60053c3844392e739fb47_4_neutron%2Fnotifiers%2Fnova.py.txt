Upon inspecting the provided code, I have identified a potential security defect:

**Security Defect: Information Disclosure**

- **Line:** 262 (LOG.debug("Sending events: %s", batched_events))
  
  This line logs the detailed batched events data, potentially leaking sensitive information about the system and its operations to log files. An attacker with access to the logs might obtain this information and exploit it for malicious purposes.

- **Solution:** The logging of detailed data, especially when it pertains to events, configurations, or any user-specific data, should be minimized or sanitized. Consider either removing this debug statement, redacting sensitive information from the batched events before logging, or ensure that the debug level is only used in trusted environments.

Apart from the above issue, I didn't notice other evident security defects in the code. However, it's worth noting that a more comprehensive review would also consider the usage and integration of the code within a broader system, the possible configurations of the system, and any external inputs that might be used unsafely within the code.
