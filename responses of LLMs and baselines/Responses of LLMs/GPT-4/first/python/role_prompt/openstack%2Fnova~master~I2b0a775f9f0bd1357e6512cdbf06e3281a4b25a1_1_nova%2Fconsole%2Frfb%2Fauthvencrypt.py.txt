After reviewing the provided code, a few security-related concerns have been identified:

1. **Use of TLS 1.2 Explicitly**: 
    - Line: `ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2`
    - Description: The code specifies TLS version 1.2 explicitly for the connection. This is a potential security concern because if a newer, more secure version of TLS becomes available and is supported by the server, the client will still only use TLS 1.2.
    - Solution: Consider using `ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23` or `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS` which selects the highest protocol version that both the client and server support, though it has some deprecated dangerous protocols. So, you should also explicitly disable specific older or vulnerable protocol versions using `ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1` or similar options.

2. **Missing Cipher Specification**:
    - Description: The code does not specify a list of allowed ciphers when setting up the SSL/TLS connection. Using weak or outdated ciphers can reduce the security of the SSL/TLS connection.
    - Solution: Consider using the `ciphers` parameter in the `ssl.wrap_socket` method to specify a list of strong ciphers that are allowed.

3. **Potential Missing Verification of Server's Hostname**:
    - Description: While the code requires server certificate validation (`cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`), it does not verify if the hostname in the certificate matches the server's hostname. This could potentially make it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if an attacker can obtain a valid certificate from a trusted CA for a different domain.
    - Solution: Consider using `ssl.match_hostname` after establishing the connection to validate the server's hostname against its certificate.

4. **Use of `ord` with Socket's `recv` Method**:
    - Lines: `maj_ver = ord(recv(1))`, `min_ver = ord(recv(1))`, `can_use_version = ord(recv(1))`, and `auth_accepted = ord(recv(1))`
    - Description: The use of `ord` assumes a single byte is always returned from the `recv` function, but if the socket is prematurely closed or if there is another issue, this could lead to unexpected behavior.
    - Solution: Handle potential issues by checking the length of the returned bytes before using `ord`.

5. **Potential Denial of Service Attack**:
    - Lines: `sub_types_cnt = ord(recv(1))` and `sub_types_raw = recv(sub_types_cnt * auth.SUBTYPE_LENGTH)`
    - Description: The code reads an arbitrary number (`sub_types_cnt`) from the server and then tries to read that many subtypes. A malicious server could send an unreasonably large value, causing the client to wait or use excessive memory while trying to read data.
    - Solution: Introduce a limit for the maximum allowed `sub_types_cnt` and check against this limit before trying to read further data.

Based on these findings, while the code does contain some good practices, such as requiring server-side certificates (`ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`), there are areas where it can be improved from a security standpoint.
