Upon reviewing the provided code, I've identified a potential security defect:

**Security Defect:**
Unvalidated input from HTTP headers is directly processed.

**Description:**
In lines 57-58, the values for `router_id` and `state` are directly obtained from HTTP headers without any validation. Using these values directly without validating or sanitizing them can lead to various attacks, including denial of service or potentially other unintended behaviors.

**Solution:**
Implement input validation for both `router_id` and `state`. Ensure that they match the expected patterns, types, or lengths. If they don't, return an appropriate error response.

Here's a simple example:
```python
if not router_id.isalnum() or not state in ['expected_state1', 'expected_state2']:
    return webob.exc.HTTPBadRequest('Invalid headers.')
```
The above example assumes that `router_id` should only contain alphanumeric characters and the state should be one of the expected states. Modify the conditions as per the actual expected patterns or values.

This is a fundamental issue in the secure coding domain called "Trust Boundaries". Always ensure that any data crossing trust boundaries (like coming from users, external systems, etc.) is properly validated before use.
