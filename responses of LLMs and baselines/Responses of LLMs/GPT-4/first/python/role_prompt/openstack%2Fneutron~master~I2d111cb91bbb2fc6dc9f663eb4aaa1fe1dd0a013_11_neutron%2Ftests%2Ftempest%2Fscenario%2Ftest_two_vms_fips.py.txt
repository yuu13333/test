After carefully reviewing the provided code, here are some observations:

1. **Hardcoded Admin Privileges**: The methods in the `TestTwoVmsFips` class use the admin privileges (`is_admin=True`) for creating and managing resources. Using admin credentials for tasks in automated tests or any kind of application can expose the system to potential risks if the account is compromised.

   - Line 38: Key pair creation with admin privileges.
   - Line 40-41: Security group creation with admin privileges.
   - Line 46: Security group rule creation with admin privileges.
   - Line 72-78: Server creation with admin privileges.
   - Line 87: Floating IP association with admin privileges.

   **Solution**: Always follow the principle of least privilege. Do not use admin credentials unless it's strictly necessary for the specific action. Adjust the roles or permissions to grant the minimum required access.

2. **Potential Lack of Input Validation**: This code seems to be a part of test scenarios, so it might be acceptable, but in general, always validate inputs. For instance, parameters passed into `create_vms` (like `hyper` and `avail_zone`) are used without validation.

   **Solution**: If this code were to be used in other contexts, always ensure that input parameters are validated for correctness and safety.

3. **Direct Use of Private Key**: In the `create_vms` method, the private key of a key pair is directly accessed and passed to the `ssh.Client`.

   - Line 91: Using the private key directly.

   **Solution**: In a production context, private keys should be handled with utmost care. Always store them securely, preferably in a hardware security module (HSM) or secrets manager, and access them only when necessary.

4. **Cleanup Actions**: In the `resource_cleanup` class method, resources are being cleaned up without any exception handling.

   - Lines 52-55: Key pair and security group cleanup.

   **Solution**: It's a good practice to wrap cleanup actions in try-catch blocks to handle potential failures gracefully and log the issues. This can help in debugging when resources fail to delete.

5. **Server Creation without Exception Handling**: Servers are being created in a loop without any exception handling.

   - Lines 70-78: Loop for server creation.

   **Solution**: Whenever resources are being created, especially in loops, it's beneficial to wrap each creation in a try-catch block to ensure that one failure does not cascade and disrupt the entire operation.

To summarize, while some of the above points might be acceptable in a test scenario, it's crucial to be aware of them when adapting or using such code in other contexts, especially production environments. Always prioritize security and robust error handling in all scenarios.
