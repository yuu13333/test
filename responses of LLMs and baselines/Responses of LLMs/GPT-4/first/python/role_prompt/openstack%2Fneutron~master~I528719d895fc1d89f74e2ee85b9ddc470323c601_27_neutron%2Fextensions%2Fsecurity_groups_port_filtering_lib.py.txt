From the provided code snippet, we're looking at metadata and some basic configurations for an OpenStack Neutron extension. The code is mostly defining strings, boolean values, and empty dictionaries/lists.

The key points for security review are:
1. Hard-coded sensitive information (like credentials, keys).
2. Unsafe operations (like unrestricted file operations, unsafe deserialization, etc.).
3. Input validation issues.
4. Potential backdoors or logic flaws that might be abused.

Let's analyze the provided code based on these points:

1. There are no hard-coded sensitive information present in this snippet.
2. The code does not contain any operations; it's defining metadata.
3. There's no input validation since the code doesn't accept or process any input.
4. The logic is straightforward, and no backdoors or logic flaws are evident.

Conclusion:

No security defects are detected in the code.
