The code appears to automate various Docker tasks, such as building, running, executing, and removing Docker containers and images. Let's review the code for potential security defects:

1. **Use of Shell in Subprocesses**:
   Using subprocess functions with shell=True or without carefully checking and sanitizing input can lead to shell injection attacks. The current code uses the `Popen` and `check_call` functions to execute Docker commands, but it constructs command arguments using string formatting, which can potentially allow for command injection if the input is not properly sanitized.
   
   Lines of interest:
   - 155: `Popen(("docker build - --quiet -t %s" % config.image_name).split(), ...)`
   - 173: `Popen(('docker run ... {config.server_name} ... {config.image_name}'.format(**locals())).split(), ...)`
   - 205: `Popen(("docker rm -f %s" % DockerConfig.get_server_name(server)).split(), ...)`
   - 217: `Popen(("docker rmi %s" % DockerConfig.get_image_name(server)).split(), ...)`
   - 197: `check_call(('docker exec {config.server_name} {script} ...'.format(**locals())).split())`
   
   Solution:
   - Instead of string formatting and splitting the resulting string, construct a list of command arguments directly. This will ensure that user-controlled data does not break out of the expected arguments.
   - Ensure that all inputs used in command construction (such as `config.image_name`, `config.server_name`, etc.) are sanitized and validated.

2. **File I/O without Proper Exception Handling**:
   - 112: `dummy_str = str_encode_hex(open(copy_file.src, 'r').read())`
   
   The code reads a file specified by `copy_file.src` without checking if the file exists or if there was any other type of I/O error.
   
   Solution:
   - Surround file I/O operations with try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions gracefully.

3. **Deprecated `has_key` Method**:
   - 99: `if os.environ.has_key("TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL"):`
   
   The `has_key` method is deprecated in Python 3 and will raise an `AttributeError`.
   
   Solution:
   - Use the `in` keyword to check for key existence: `if "TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL" in os.environ:`.

4. **Potential Print and Exit without Proper Feedback**:
   - 162, 163, 181, 182: If there's an error, the code prints the error and exits with a `-1` code. While this is not a direct security defect, it can make debugging more difficult as there's no context provided.
   
   Solution:
   - Instead of directly using `print`, consider raising an exception with a meaningful error message or logging the error with more context.

5. **No Check on Docker Availability**: The code assumes that Docker is installed and available on the system.
   
   Solution:
   - Before executing any Docker command, ensure that Docker is installed and accessible. You have a `docker_version()` function that checks for Docker's availability, but it's not clear if it's used before other Docker operations.

6. **Hard-coded Script Path**:
   - 186: `script = '/post_startup.py'`
   
   The script path is hard-coded, which can be a limitation in different environments.
   
   Solution:
   - Consider making the script path configurable or clearly document the expected location.

In summary, the main concern is the potential for command injection through unsanitized inputs. Ensure that all input data, especially those that get used in command-line arguments, are validated and sanitized appropriately.
