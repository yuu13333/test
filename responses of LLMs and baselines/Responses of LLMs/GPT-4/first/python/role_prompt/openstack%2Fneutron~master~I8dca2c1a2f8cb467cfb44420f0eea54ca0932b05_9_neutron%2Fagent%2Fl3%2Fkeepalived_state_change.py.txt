After reviewing the provided code, I found a potential security defect:

#### Security Defect:

- **Uncontrolled File Creation / Arbitrary File Overwrite (Potential Path Traversal)**
  
  - **Line Number**: 118
  - **Description**: The `write_state_change` method writes the router's state (either "master" or "backup") to a file in a directory specified by `self.conf_dir`. If an attacker can control the value of `self.conf_dir`, they might be able to overwrite any file on the system or create new files. Overwriting certain files could lead to privilege escalation, code execution, or denial of service. The risk is further increased if the daemon runs with elevated privileges.
  - **Solution**: Validate and sanitize the `conf_dir` variable to ensure that it points to the expected directory and does not contain directory traversal sequences like "../". Also, ensure that only trusted sources can modify the configuration values for the application.

Additional recommendations for improvement (not necessarily security defects):

- **Logging User-Controlled Data**:
  
  - **Line Number**: 133
  - **Description**: The code logs the entire `resp` object if the response status is not 200. It's a general good practice to avoid logging full HTTP responses, especially if they could contain sensitive or unexpected information.
  - **Solution**: Log only necessary details and avoid logging potential user-controlled content or sensitive information.

- **Hardcoded Localhost URL**:
  
  - **Line Number**: 127
  - **Description**: The URL 'http://127.0.0.1/' is hardcoded in the `notify_agent` method. It's worth noting that, while this may be fine for this specific use case, hardcoded values can limit flexibility and make the system harder to adapt to different configurations.
  - **Solution**: Consider moving such configurations to external configuration files or environment variables.

To conclude, while the major concern is around the potential path traversal vulnerability in line 118, you should ensure that all configurations and user inputs are correctly sanitized and validated throughout the codebase to minimize potential security issues.
