The code provided is an implementation of Server Group API Extension in OpenStack's Nova service. I've reviewed the code for potential security defects. Here's what I found:

1. **Potential Information Disclosure in Log**:
   - In the `_get_not_deleted` function, the code logs potentially sensitive information about instances.
     ```python
     LOG.debug('Querying cell %(cell)s for %(num)i instances', {'cell': cell_mapping.identity, 'num': len(uuids)})
     ```
     *Line 76*.
   
   While logging is useful for debugging, printing out potentially sensitive information (like instance identifiers, cell information, etc.) in the logs could be considered an information leak if logs are not adequately protected or if logging levels are misconfigured.

   **Solution**: Consider masking or obfuscating sensitive details if they are not critical for debugging.

2. **Exception Handling**:
   - When handling exceptions in various parts of the code, the error message from the exception is directly sent as a response in cases like `webob.exc.HTTPNotFound(explanation=e.format_message())`. Directly sending backend error messages to the client can sometimes leak internal details.

   **Solution**: Consider using generic error messages for the client and log the specific error for debugging.

3. **Authorization**:
   - The code has implemented authorization checks like `_authorize_context(req, 'show')`, which is a good security practice. However, it's critical to ensure that the `sg_policies.POLICY_ROOT % action` being passed and the policies being checked are correctly defined and enforce appropriate restrictions.

4. **Quota Recheck**:
   - The `CONF.quota.recheck_quota` section at the end of the code helps to prevent race conditions related to quota checks. This is a great feature, but it's important to note that if this isn't set correctly, it can result in the potential for users to bypass quota restrictions.
     ```python
     if CONF.quota.recheck_quota:
     ```
     *Line 217*.

   **Solution**: Ensure that configurations related to quota checks are set and managed securely.

Apart from these concerns, no other obvious security defects were detected in the code. As always, ensure comprehensive testing in a controlled environment before deploying any changes.
