After analyzing the given code, I've identified a potential security defect:

**Security Defect: Privilege Escalation**
- **Line 78:** `context = self.obj_context.elevated()`
- **Description:** The method `elevated()` returns a copy of the current context with `is_admin` set to `True`, meaning it elevates privileges for this context to an administrative level. This can potentially allow actions to be taken with administrative rights even if the original request came from a non-administrative user.
- **Solution:** Carefully review and validate the need to elevate the context. If administrative privileges are genuinely needed, ensure that the code is only accessible to trusted functions and does not allow unauthorized users to bypass controls. If the elevation is not needed, then simply use the original context without elevating it.

Please ensure that other parts of the system interacting with this code understand and correctly handle this elevated context, otherwise, it can lead to unintended behaviors and potential vulnerabilities.

Aside from the aforementioned potential issue, I did not identify other immediate security defects in the provided code.
