After a thorough review of the provided code, I've identified the following security defect:

#### Security Defect:

**Issue:** Potential Denial of Service (DoS) through exhausting socket read attempts.

**Line Numbers:** 86-94 (specifically line 89).

**Details:** In the function `recv()`, the method `sock.recv(num)` attempts to read `num` bytes from the socket. However, if the socket doesn't return the expected number of bytes, the code raises an exception with the message that contains the actual data read from the socket (`'result': b` in line 91). This can be exploited by an attacker to send less data than expected, causing the system to repeatedly attempt to read from the socket until it fails, potentially leading to a Denial of Service. Moreover, logging the raw result could leak unexpected data, which may lead to further security implications depending on the nature of the data.

**Solution:** It's important to have a mechanism to prevent infinite or prolonged reads. You should have a timeout for socket operations, and it's recommended to avoid logging the raw content of the unexpected data. Instead, just note that an unexpected amount of data was received.

```python
b = sock.recv(num, socket.MSG_WAITALL)  # Ensures all data is read or an error occurs.
if len(b) != num:
    reason = _("Incorrect read from socket, wanted %(wanted)d bytes but got %(got)d.") % {'wanted': num, 'got': len(b)}
    raise exception.RFBAuthHandshakeFailed(reason=reason)
```

To use `socket.MSG_WAITALL`, you will also need to `import socket`. This change ensures that the `recv` either reads all the expected data or fails. 

That said, remember that such changes can have other implications. It's important to test thoroughly to ensure that no new issues are introduced.

Aside from the above defect, the code appears to handle errors and exceptions quite well and uses proper security schemes and protocols.
