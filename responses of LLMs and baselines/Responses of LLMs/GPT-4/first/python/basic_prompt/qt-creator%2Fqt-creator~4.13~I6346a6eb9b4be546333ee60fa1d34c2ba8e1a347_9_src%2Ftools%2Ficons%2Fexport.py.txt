Upon analyzing the code, there are some security concerns that need to be addressed:

1. **Potential Arbitrary File Read** (Line 55)
    ```python
    svgTree.parse(qtcRoot() + svgFile)
    ```
    The code is reading an SVG file directly based on the provided file path (`svgFile`). If an attacker has control over this input, they might try to make the program read an arbitrary file.

    *Solution*: Ensure that the `svgFile` is validated and is within the expected directory or path. Also, check for path traversal attempts like `..` in the file path.

2. **Potential Command Injection** (Lines 102-120, Lines 124-134)
    When invoking external processes with `subprocess`, if an attacker can control parts of the command or its arguments, they can potentially execute arbitrary commands.

    Specifically, in this script:
    - SVG IDs, which are taken from the SVG file itself, are being used as part of the command that gets passed to Inkscape. 
    - PNG filenames, which are constructed based on SVG IDs, are passed to `optipng`.
  
    If the SVG file (or its content) comes from an untrusted source, an attacker could embed SVG IDs that are crafted in such a way that they manipulate the command line.

    *Solution*: Ensure that SVG IDs and any other inputs used in command invocation are strictly validated and sanitized. Only allow expected characters for SVG IDs. Escape or reject any special characters or sequences that can be interpreted by the shell. Using a whitelist approach for allowed characters is generally safer than a blacklist approach.

3. **Potential Denial of Service (DoS) via Regex** (Line 57)
    ```python
    pattern = re.compile(svgElementFilter)
    ```
    Regular expressions can be susceptible to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks. If an attacker can provide a malicious regex pattern, they might be able to cause excessive backtracking and CPU usage.

    *Solution*: Limit the complexity and length of user-provided regex patterns. Alternatively, consider using a safer regex engine or library that's not susceptible to these kinds of attacks.

4. **Potential Information Disclosure** (Line 84-97)
    The script prints out the names of files which haven't been exported. Depending on the context in which this script is run, disclosing filenames might be a potential security issue, especially if the filenames themselves contain sensitive information.

    *Solution*: Consider if this information is essential for the user. If not, consider removing it or providing an option to enable/disable this output based on the context in which the script will be run.

5. **Potential Unhandled Exceptions**
    It is a good practice to handle exceptions that may occur during file operations, subprocess calls, etc., and handle them gracefully. For instance, the script does have some exception handling in the `svgIDs` function (Line 64), but it might be beneficial to also handle potential exceptions that could occur when opening files, executing subprocesses, etc.

    *Solution*: Add appropriate try-except blocks around potentially risky operations and handle exceptions gracefully, informing the user of the error without crashing or exposing detailed stack traces.

6. **Dependence on External Tools**
    This isn't necessarily a security concern, but it's a dependency concern. The script depends on `Inkscape` and `optipng` to be available in the path. If these tools aren't installed or aren't the expected versions, the script might not work correctly or may exhibit unexpected behavior.

    *Solution*: Document the versions of the required tools and ensure that any errors arising from these tools are handled gracefully.

To reiterate, the most significant concerns here revolve around potentially untrusted input (from files or arguments) being used to invoke external processes or being used in regex patterns. Validating and sanitizing inputs, especially when they're used in potentially risky operations, is crucial.
