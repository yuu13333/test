Upon analyzing the code, I have identified a few potential security issues:

1. **Command Injection**:
    - **Line 62-64**: The code uses `processutils.execute()` to invoke the `systemctl` command with arguments. While the command itself and the first argument ("is-system-running") are hardcoded and safe, blindly executing commands can lead to command injection if not carefully managed. While this specific instance might not directly pose a risk, it's a pattern you should be cautious about in general.

2. **Improper Error Handling**:
    - **Line 98-103**: Catching `processutils.ProcessExecutionError` exceptions and inspecting error messages can sometimes leak information about the internal workings of the system. While the logged error message doesn't seem to expose critical details in this case, it's a good practice to avoid logging raw system errors.

3. **Information Disclosure**:
    - **Line 158-160**: Logging whether a system uses `systemd` or not might not be a direct security risk, but it can provide an attacker with useful information about the system's internals.

4. **Potential Race Condition**:
    - **Line 168-178**: Checking if a mount point is mounted and then performing operations based on that check is subject to a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. An attacker might be able to exploit the time gap between the check and the use. A safer approach is to perform the desired operation and handle failures, rather than checking first.

5. **Improper Use of Global Variables**:
    - **Line 45 and 49-70**: The function `is_systemd()` modifies the global variable `_is_systemd` which could lead to unexpected behavior if multiple threads call this function simultaneously. Consider using thread-safe methods or local caching mechanisms instead of a global variable.

**Recommendations**:

1. Always validate and sanitize input, especially if it's used in command execution.
2. Avoid logging detailed error messages from system operations. Instead, log generic error messages and consider other means to convey detailed error messages to administrators.
3. When performing checks before operations (like checking if something is mounted before unmounting), be aware of the potential race conditions and design your logic to handle them.
4. For global states like `_is_systemd`, consider alternatives that are more thread-safe, such as using thread-local storage, or refactoring the logic to avoid the need for global state.

While the identified issues might not lead to direct exploits, addressing them would harden the code against potential future changes that might introduce vulnerabilities.
