After reviewing the provided code, I've identified a security defect:

### Security Defect:

**Issue**: Uncontrolled use of open files may lead to resource exhaustion.

**Line numbers**: 143, 144, 145

**Explanation**:
The methods `__enter__` and `__exit__` of the `Transcriber` class involve opening files. However, if a caller creates multiple instances of the `Transcriber` class and doesn't properly handle exceptions or doesn't use the context manager aspect correctly, they could inadvertently exhaust the system's file descriptors.

Additionally, the context manager `AtomicRenameTemporaryFile` also opens files but handles exceptions correctly to ensure they are closed. However, the outer context manager (`Transcriber`) should also be careful about resource handling.

### Solution:
To address this concern, it would be beneficial to:

1. Ensure that all usage of the `Transcriber` and its derived classes are within a context manager (i.e., `with` block). This would ensure that files are closed even if an exception is raised.
2. Include clear documentation that recommends using the `Transcriber` class and its derivatives within a `with` block to ensure resources are managed correctly.
3. Consider adding an explicit `close` method to the `Transcriber` class to close any open resources.

Please note that while this concern might not lead to a direct security vulnerability in a standalone manner, it can become an issue when combined with other factors in a larger system, particularly if the class is used incorrectly or in a manner that wasn't intended by the original developers. Proper documentation and safeguards can help avoid potential issues.
