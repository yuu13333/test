Upon inspecting the provided code, the following security-related considerations arise:

1. **Potential SQL Injection through `router_db['extra_attributes']`**:
    - Lines 47, 54, 69, and others involve direct or indirect interaction with a database through the `router_db['extra_attributes']` attribute.
    - If there's a possibility that the values in `router_db['extra_attributes']` can be controlled or influenced by an external user input, it can lead to SQL injection.
    - However, from the provided code, we don't see direct external user input affecting this attribute. Still, you should ensure that anywhere `router_db['extra_attributes']` gets its values, the input is properly sanitized or parameterized to prevent SQL injection.
    
2. **Type/Value Validation**:
    - The `set_extra_attr_value` method (starting at Line 60) sets a key's value in the `router_db['extra_attributes']`. However, there's a limited check for whether the key is valid (Line 63) and no obvious validation for the value itself.
    - Ensure that any values passed into this method undergo strict validation to prevent unexpected behavior or potential security vulnerabilities.

3. **Error Handling**:
    - The `RuntimeError` on Lines 80-81 could potentially leak internal information if it's directly exposed to end users.
    - Always ensure that error messages provided to end users are generic and don't disclose internal workings or architecture details.
  
4. **Transformations**:
    - The transformations functions (Lines 49-50, 65-66) can be a potential source of issues if not handled correctly. Ensure that `transform_to_db` and `transform_from_db` functions from the `az_validator` are rigorously tested for any unexpected input values and behaviors.
  
5. **Data Integrity**:
    - The method `set_extra_attr_value` (starting at Line 60) updates the database with new values. Ensure there's a mechanism to rollback changes if any part of the update process fails to maintain data integrity.

6. **Configuration Defaults**:
    - The function `get_attr_info` (starting at Line 28) relies on default values from configurations (Lines 30-31). Ensure these defaults are safe, especially if they can be overwritten by user configurations.

Recommendation:

- While there are no overt security defects like plain-text passwords, it's important to assess how this code integrates into the larger system. Many vulnerabilities emerge from the misuse or misconfiguration of components rather than defects in the components themselves.
- You should also have rigorous input validation and error-handling processes throughout your application, not just in the provided code, to further harden against potential security threats.

Lastly, always consider running a dedicated security linter or security-focused static code analysis tool on your codebase. This can help identify vulnerabilities or patterns that may not be immediately visible through manual code reviews.
