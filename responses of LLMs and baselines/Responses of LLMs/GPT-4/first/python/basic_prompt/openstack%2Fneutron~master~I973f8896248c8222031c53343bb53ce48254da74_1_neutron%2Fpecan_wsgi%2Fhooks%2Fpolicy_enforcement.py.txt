Upon reviewing the code provided, here are some observations related to security and potential improvements:

1. **Policy Enforcement Consistency**: 
    - The policy enforcement checks are scattered throughout the code. While the actual implementation may be correct, the scattered nature of these checks might make it more challenging to audit and ensure all the required policies are enforced properly.
    - *Recommendation*: Centralize policy checks or have a consistent pattern across different methods and classes to ensure you don't miss out on any necessary checks.

2. **Error Message Leakage**: 
    - At line `157`, the message `msg = _('The resource could not be found.')` is raised when the policy is not authorized. It's crucial to ensure that error messages don't leak sensitive details or mislead the user. This error message might be misleading in the context it's used, as it's returned for an authorization failure, not an actual "resource not found" scenario.
    - *Recommendation*: Consider adjusting the error message to better represent the actual error context.

3. **HTTP Status Codes**:
    - In the `after` method (lines `159-226`), the error handling can result in setting the status code to 404 for a `PolicyNotAuthorized` error. Similar to the above point, using a 404 for authorization failures can be misleading. Normally, a 403 (Forbidden) status code might be more appropriate for authorization issues.
    - *Recommendation*: Re-evaluate the usage of HTTP status codes to ensure they accurately represent the error context.

4. **Avoid Silent Failures**:
    - In several places, the code captures exceptions and may log them but allows the program to continue running without re-raising the exception. For example, at lines `146-157`, `199-220`, etc. In a security context, silent failures can sometimes allow malicious users to probe the system without triggering alerts or halting inappropriate actions.
    - *Recommendation*: Consider a robust logging mechanism, and in certain cases, halt the process or return an error if something unexpected happens.

5. **Deep Copy vs. Shallow Copy**:
    - At line `93`, a shallow copy (`resources_copy = resources[:]`) is made of the `resources` list. Depending on the underlying structure and objects within the list, there might be a risk of inadvertent modifications if the objects within the list are mutable.
    - *Recommendation*: Assess whether a deep copy (using `copy.deepcopy`) might be more appropriate based on the types and usages of the `resources`.

6. **Code Complexity**: 
    - While this isn't a direct security concern, high code complexity can make it challenging to spot potential security issues and also makes the code harder to maintain and review in the future. 
    - *Recommendation*: Consider refactoring and breaking down complex methods into smaller, more manageable functions.

7. **Attribute Handling**:
    - The `_exclude_attributes_by_policy` method (lines `240-280`) and related methods handle which attributes are visible and which should be excluded based on policies. Ensure that this process doesn't accidentally expose sensitive attributes due to misconfiguration or oversight in policy definitions.
    - *Recommendation*: Regularly review the policy definitions and tests to ensure attribute visibility is as intended.

In summary, while the code may function correctly, some of the practices can be improved to ensure better maintainability and security in the future. Consider the recommendations provided and regularly review and test the code, especially when updates or changes are made.
