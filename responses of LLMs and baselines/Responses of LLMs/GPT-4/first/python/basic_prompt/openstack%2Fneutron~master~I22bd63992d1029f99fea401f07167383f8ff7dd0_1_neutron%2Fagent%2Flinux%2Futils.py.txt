After reviewing the provided code, I have identified a security defect:

### Security Defect: Command Injection Vulnerability

- **Location**: Lines 83-96 in `create_process` function
- **Description**: The `create_process` function creates a subprocess based on a command input, which includes an environment variable addition (`addl_env`). The potential issue arises from how the command (`cmd`) is constructed and executed. If untrusted user input can influence either `addl_env` or `cmd`, it may lead to command injection, where an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system.
- **Solution**:
    - **Sanitization**: Ensure that any user input contributing to `cmd` or `addl_env` is properly sanitized to prevent command injection. This involves escaping or filtering out characters that could be interpreted as command control characters.
    - **Validation**: Where possible, validate the inputs against a list of allowed commands and environment variables.
    - **Limit Execution Context**: Avoid running commands with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary. Consider implementing more stringent checks when `run_as_root` is `True`.

Apart from this, the code generally seems to follow good security practices, such as not using `shell=True` in `subprocess.Popen` which is a common source of shell injection vulnerabilities. However, the full context of how user input is handled or how these functions are called is not clear from the snippet provided. It's important to ensure that any external input that could reach these functions is properly validated and sanitized.
