After a detailed review of the provided code, here's a security-related observation:

### **Potential Information Disclosure:**
The code seems to contain comments related to a potential bug or an issue (`# This is bug 1825537 ...`). While this may not be a direct vulnerability in the logic of the application, it can be a potential source of information disclosure.

#### **Line Numbers:** 
69-75

#### **Explanation:**
Comments like these can inadvertently give an attacker insights into potential weak spots in the software or its history of vulnerabilities. When an attacker is aware of a certain issue or its context, they can use this information to exploit other related parts of the software, or simply use this knowledge as a hint of where to look for more vulnerabilities.

#### **Solution:**
To avoid this kind of information disclosure:
1. Ensure that sensitive comments, especially those related to vulnerabilities or bugs, are not included in production code.
2. Regularly conduct code reviews and consider using tools that can help in stripping comments from code before deployment.

While this isn't a direct security vulnerability, it's a good practice to be cautious about what's included in the comments of the production code.

Other than that, the code does not seem to contain direct security defects related to its logic or functionality.
