Upon reviewing the code, I've identified a potential security issue:

### Security Defect

**Line Numbers:** 24-33

**Issue:** Potential Privilege Escalation

**Description:** In the `ids_from_instance` function, the context of a user is being checked to see if they are an administrator (admin) and if the project ID of their context doesn't match the project ID of the instance. If both conditions are met, the function uses the instance's project ID rather than the one from the user's context. The same check is done for the user ID.

This means that if an admin makes a request related to an instance not owned by them (i.e., owned by another user and/or another project), the `ids_from_instance` function could potentially return the project and user ID of that other instance. This could lead to unintended actions being taken on behalf of that other user or project, leading to potential privilege escalation.

**Solution:** 

1. Ensure that there's a valid use-case for an admin to act on behalf of other users or projects. If not, you should modify the logic to prevent this kind of behavior.
2. If there is a valid use-case, ensure that there are proper auditing and logging mechanisms in place, so any actions taken on behalf of others are well-documented. Additionally, consider implementing secondary confirmation checks before performing critical actions.

Apart from the above-mentioned issue, the rest of the code doesn't seem to have evident security defects. However, the code also relies on many external modules and methods that weren't provided (like the `quota` module). It's essential to review those external modules and methods too for a comprehensive security assessment.
