The code is quite extensive, so I'll focus on identifying any potential security defects based on the specified CWE categories. If any are found, I'll describe them in detail, including the corresponding line number, and suggest solutions. If no security defects are detected, I'll state that as well.

Upon reviewing the code, I have not identified any security defects related to the specified CWE categories. Therefore, my conclusion is: "No security defects are detected in the code."

However, it's important to note that this assessment is based on the visible code and the context provided. Security reviews are complex and can depend on various factors, including how the code interacts with other components, the environment in which it's deployed, and the overall architecture of the system. For a comprehensive security analysis, a more detailed review considering these factors would be recommended.
