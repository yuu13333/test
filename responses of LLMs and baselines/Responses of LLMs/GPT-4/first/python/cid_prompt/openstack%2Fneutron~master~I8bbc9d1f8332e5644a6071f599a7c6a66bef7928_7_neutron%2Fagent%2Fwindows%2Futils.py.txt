After reviewing the provided code, here are some potential security defects identified according to the specified CWE categories:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: 
   - There doesn't seem to be any direct issue related to improper access control in the given code.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**:
   - No specific defects were identified related to improper interaction between multiple entities.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
   - Line 75: The code closes `obj.stdin` but does not handle the closing of `stdout` and `stderr` pipes of the subprocess. This could potentially lead to resource leakage.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**:
   - No defects were identified related to incorrect calculations.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**:
   - Line 59: The `execute` function is called without proper exception handling. If an error occurs in `execute`, it might disrupt the control flow, especially since the error handling in `kill_process` seems insufficient.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**:
   - No specific protection mechanism failures are apparent in the provided code snippet.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**:
   - Line 130: The method of checking if a process is running by string matching in `tasklist` output is unreliable and could lead to incorrect comparisons, especially if the PID is a substring of another PID.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**:
   - Line 59: The absence of detailed exception handling in the `execute` function call within `kill_process` could lead to improper handling of exceptions.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**:
   - Line 129: The code constructs a command line by concatenating a PID into a string, which could be a vector for command injection if the PID is not properly validated or sanitized.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**:
    - General: The code does not consistently adhere to Python coding standards, which may not be a direct security issue but can lead to maintainability problems and indirectly to security vulnerabilities.

For remediation:
- Ensure proper resource management by closing all pipes associated with subprocesses.
- Implement comprehensive exception handling, particularly in `execute` and `kill_process` functions.
- Sanitize or validate all inputs used in command construction to prevent injection attacks.
- Adhere to Python coding standards for better code clarity and maintenance.
