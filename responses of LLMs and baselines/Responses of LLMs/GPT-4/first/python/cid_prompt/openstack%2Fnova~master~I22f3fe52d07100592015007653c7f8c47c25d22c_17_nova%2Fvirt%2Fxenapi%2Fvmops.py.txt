Upon reviewing the code, here are the findings regarding security defects:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: 
   - No specific instances of improper access control were detected in the provided code.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: 
   - No specific instances of improper interaction between multiple entities were detected in the provided code.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: 
   - No specific instances of improper control of a resource through its lifetime were detected in the provided code.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: 
   - No specific instances of incorrect calculation were detected in the provided code.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: 
   - No specific instances of insufficient control flow management were detected in the provided code.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: 
   - No specific instances of protection mechanism failure were detected in the provided code.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: 
   - No specific instances of incorrect comparison were detected in the provided code.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: 
   - There are instances in the code where exceptions are caught and logged but not rethrown or adequately handled (for example, lines 2503-2511). This can lead to the program continuing its execution in an unstable state. It would be more secure to rethrow the exception or handle it in a way that does not compromise the stability and security of the application.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: 
   - No specific instances of improper neutralization were detected in the provided code.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: 
    - No specific instances of improper adherence to coding standards were detected in the provided code.

In summary, the primary concern identified is related to CWE-703, where exceptions are caught but not adequately handled, potentially leading to instability. It's recommended to review the exception handling strategy to ensure that the application remains stable and secure even when exceptions occur.
