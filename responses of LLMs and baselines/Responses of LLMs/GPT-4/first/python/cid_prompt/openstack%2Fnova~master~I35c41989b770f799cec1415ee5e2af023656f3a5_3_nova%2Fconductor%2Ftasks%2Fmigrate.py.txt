After reviewing the provided code, here are the findings related to the specified Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** No explicit issues related to improper access control are detected in the code. The code seems to manage access control appropriately.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):** No specific issues related to improper interaction between multiple entities are identified.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):** There is a potential issue in line 462 with the `revert_allocation_for_migration` function. If an exception occurs in this function, the resources might not be properly released or reverted. A more robust exception handling mechanism could be implemented to ensure resources are always reverted in case of errors.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):** No incorrect calculations are evident in the code.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):** The code has control flow checks and exceptions are raised as needed (lines 54, 82, 287, 445). No specific issues in this category.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):** No evident failures in protection mechanisms are detected.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):** No incorrect comparisons are observed.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** In lines 462-463, while the rollback function handles exceptions, the implementation might benefit from more comprehensive error handling to cover potential edge cases.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):** There doesn't appear to be issues related to improper neutralization.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):** The code generally follows good coding practices and standards. However, adherence to coding standards is often subjective and depends on the specific standards adopted by the development team.

**Recommendation for CWE-664 and CWE-703:** Enhance the exception handling in the `revert_allocation_for_migration` function to ensure that resources are properly managed and reverted in all cases, especially when exceptions occur. This can prevent resource leaks and ensure consistent state management.
