After reviewing the provided code, several potential security defects were identified. The defects correspond to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories you provided. Here are the details:

1. **CWE-78 (OS Command Injection)**: Although not directly listed in your categories, there is a risk of OS command injection in this script. The function `exportPngs` (lines 101-120) constructs a command line for Inkscape by concatenating user-supplied inputs without proper validation or sanitization. If an attacker can control the `svgIDs` or `scaleFactors`, they could inject malicious commands.

   **Solution**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs. Avoid constructing command lines by concatenating user inputs.

2. **CWE-22 (Path Traversal)**: The `svgIDs` function (lines 50-68) and others construct file paths using user-supplied input without validation, potentially leading to path traversal vulnerabilities.

   **Solution**: Validate and sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal.

3. **CWE-77 (Command Injection)**: The subprocess calls in `exportPngs` and `optimizePngs` functions (lines 101-134) do not use shell=False, which might allow command injection if the input parameters are not properly sanitized.

   **Solution**: Use `shell=False` in `subprocess` calls and ensure input parameters are sanitized.

4. **CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource)**: The script does not explicitly handle file permissions, which could lead to sensitive files being created with insecure permissions (lines 122-134).

   **Solution**: Explicitly set secure file permissions when creating new files.

5. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: This relates to the improper neutralization of special elements, which is a concern in the context of command injection risks already mentioned.

   **Solution**: Properly neutralize special elements in inputs used in command line construction.

6. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: The script uses a broad `try...except` block (lines 58-64) which could hide exceptions that are not related to the expected error (missing 'id' attribute).

   **Solution**: Narrow down the exception handling to specific expected errors.

7. **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**: While not directly listed in your categories, improper validation of user input is a prevalent issue in this script. Inputs are used in file path construction and subprocess calls without sufficient validation.

   **Solution**: Implement thorough input validation throughout the script.

8. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The script lacks proper adherence to coding standards in terms of error handling, input validation, and security checks.

   **Solution**: Refactor the code to adhere to secure coding standards, including proper error handling and input validation.

In summary, the primary concerns are related to command injection, path traversal, improper error handling, and insufficient input validation. Remedying these issues involves implementing strict input validation, sanitization, secure subprocess calls, and adherence to secure coding practices.
