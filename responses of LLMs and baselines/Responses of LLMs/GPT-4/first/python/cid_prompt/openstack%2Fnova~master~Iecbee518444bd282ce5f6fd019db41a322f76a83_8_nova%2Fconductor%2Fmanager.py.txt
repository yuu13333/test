After reviewing the provided code, several security defects were found. These defects are listed below with their corresponding line numbers and suggested solutions:

1. **CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**
   - **Issue**: Potential resource leaks due to exceptions not being handled properly in several areas, such as in the `schedule_and_build_instances` method (lines 1313-1495). Exceptions raised during the scheduling and building process may not release allocated resources correctly.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that all resources are correctly released in case of exceptions. Use context managers or finally blocks to release resources even when exceptions occur.

2. **CWE-707: Improper Neutralization**
   - **Issue**: Potential SQL injection vulnerability through improper neutralization of special elements. The use of string concatenation or interpolation in SQL queries, such as in `_create_block_device_mapping` method (lines 1166-1181), could expose the system to SQL injection if user-controllable data is used.
   - **Solution**: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Avoid using string concatenation to form SQL queries.

3. **CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management**
   - **Issue**: Insufficient control flow in some methods, such as in `_cleanup_build_artifacts` (lines 1496-1543), where exceptions might lead to skipping necessary cleanup steps.
   - **Solution**: Refactor methods to ensure that all necessary steps are executed regardless of the control flow path taken. This could include reordering code, adding additional control flow checks, or using finally blocks.

4. **CWE-284: Improper Access Control**
   - **Issue**: Potential improper access control due to lack of validation checks in some functions. For instance, in `schedule_and_build_instances` (lines 1313-1495), there are no checks to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to perform the actions.
   - **Solution**: Implement proper access control checks to ensure that users have the required permissions before allowing them to execute certain actions.

5. **CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation**
   - **Issue**: There is a possibility of incorrect calculations in functions like `_volume_size` (lines 1154-1164), which could lead to wrong resource allocations.
   - **Solution**: Review the logic in functions that perform calculations to ensure correctness. Add unit tests to validate the logic under various scenarios.

6. **CWE-435: Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities**
   - **Issue**: The code exhibits complex interactions between various entities, such as different Nova components, which increases the risk of unexpected behaviors, especially under error conditions, as seen in methods like `schedule_and_build_instances`.
   - **Solution**: Simplify the interactions where possible and ensure robust error handling and logging to capture and handle inter-component interaction issues.

It's recommended to perform a thorough security review and testing of the code to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities and to ensure robust error handling and resource management.
