After reviewing the provided code, I identified a few potential security defects. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):**
   - The code does not appear to have any explicit improper access control issues. It correctly uses SSL for secure connections and x509 for authentication.

2. **Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities (CWE-435):**
   - The code appears to handle interactions appropriately, particularly in the SSL/TLS handshake and authentication process.

3. **Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime (CWE-664):**
   - There might be a potential issue with the socket `compute_sock` being passed around without explicit closure in cases of exceptions (lines 64-152). It's recommended to use a context manager or try-finally block to ensure resources are properly managed.

4. **Incorrect Calculation (CWE-682):**
   - No incorrect calculations were found in the code. The code primarily handles protocol handshakes and SSL/TLS connections without complex calculations.

5. **Insufficient Control Flow Management (CWE-691):**
   - The code seems to handle exceptions adequately with specific `raise` statements in case of protocol mismatch or SSL errors (lines 70, 84, 93, 110, 124, 152).

6. **Protection Mechanism Failure (CWE-693):**
   - The use of SSL/TLS (line 137-144) is correctly implemented, but it only allows for TLS 1.2 (line 144). This might be a limitation if newer, more secure versions are available.

7. **Incorrect Comparison (CWE-697):**
   - No incorrect comparisons are observed. The code uses equality and inequality checks appropriately.

8. **Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-703):**
   - The exception handling seems proper, but it might be beneficial to include more specific error logging or handling in case of SSL errors (lines 149-152).

9. **Improper Neutralization (CWE-707):**
   - The code does not seem to involve operations where improper neutralization (like SQL injection, command injection) would be relevant.

10. **Improper Adherence to Coding Standards (CWE-710):**
    - The code follows standard Python coding practices, including exception handling and logging. However, the lack of resource management for `compute_sock` could be seen as a deviation from robust coding standards.

**Recommendations:**
- For the potential issue under CWE-664, ensure that the socket `compute_sock` is properly closed in all cases, possibly using a context manager.
- For the protection mechanism under CWE-693, consider supporting newer versions of SSL/TLS if available.
- Implement more specific error handling for SSL errors to provide clearer debugging information.
