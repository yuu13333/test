After thoroughly reviewing the provided code, here are my observations regarding potential security defects:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: 
   - The methods in the `Quotas` class, especially those related to creating, updating, and destroying quota limits (e.g., `_create_limit_in_db`, `_update_limit_in_db`, `_destroy_all_in_db_by_project`, etc.), do not appear to perform explicit access control checks. This absence could allow unauthorized users to modify quota limits. However, without the broader context of how these methods are invoked, it's difficult to definitively conclude a violation of CWE-284.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement explicit access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can invoke these sensitive operations.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: 
   - No clear indication of improper interaction between multiple entities is observed in the provided code.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: 
   - The code seems to manage resource lifetimes appropriately, particularly for database transactions and quota objects.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: 
   - No evidence of incorrect calculations was found in the code snippet.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**:
   - The code appears to manage control flow properly, including handling exceptions for quota-related operations.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**:
   - As mentioned in CWE-284, the potential lack of access control could be seen as a failure of a protection mechanism, depending on the broader context of the application's security architecture.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**:
   - The code does not show any obvious incorrect comparisons.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**:
   - Exceptions are handled appropriately in the methods that interact with the database (e.g., `_get_from_db`, `_create_limit_in_db`, etc.). There is no evidence of improper handling of exceptional conditions.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**:
   - The code does not seem to involve input validation or neutralization directly. However, without the context of how input data is fed into these methods, it's hard to fully assess this.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**:
    - The code follows good coding practices and standards, including documentation (TODO comments) and structured exception handling.

In conclusion, the primary area of concern is related to access control (CWE-284). It's recommended to ensure that appropriate access control measures are implemented, particularly for operations that modify quota limits. The other CWE categories do not exhibit clear issues based on the provided code snippet.
