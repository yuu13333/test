After reviewing the provided code snippet, I can provide an analysis for potential security defects based on the listed Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). 

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: The code does not directly handle access control mechanisms, as it primarily deals with configuration settings. No issues related to improper access control are apparent.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: This code snippet does not seem to involve interactions between multiple entities in a way that would lead to security issues.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: The script is focused on configuration settings, not on the management of resource lifetimes. No issues are detected in this regard.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: The script does not perform any complex calculations that could lead to incorrect results.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: The code is quite straightforward without complex control flow, and there are no apparent issues related to control flow management.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: There are no explicit protection mechanisms in place in this script that could fail.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: The code does not involve any complex comparisons that could be incorrect.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: The code does not explicitly handle exceptions or perform checks that could be considered improper.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: This type of weakness usually pertains to the handling of inputs that can be manipulated to cause a system to perform actions unintended by the developer. The code does not appear to handle external input in a way that would require neutralization.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The code seems to follow standard Python coding practices and does not show apparent deviations from coding standards.

However, a potential issue that should be considered, though not directly related to the listed CWEs, is the handling of the configuration for the metrics collection interval (lines 28-38). Allowing a negative value (-1) to disable the feature could lead to confusion or unintended behavior if the user is not aware of this convention. It might be more intuitive to use a more explicit method to enable or disable the metrics collection, such as a separate boolean configuration option.

In conclusion, based on the CWE categories provided and the contents of the code, no security defects are detected in the code. However, it's always recommended to conduct thorough testing and possibly a code review to uncover any less apparent issues.
