After reviewing the provided code, here are my observations regarding potential security defects categorized by the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: 
   - No direct issues related to improper access control are observed in the code.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: 
   - No apparent issues related to improper interaction between multiple entities are detected.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: 
   - No explicit issues regarding the improper control of a resource through its lifetime are found.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: 
   - No incorrect calculations are observed in the code.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: 
   - No clear deficiencies in control flow management are identified.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: 
   - No issues related to the failure of protection mechanisms are evident.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: 
   - No incorrect comparisons are detected in the code.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: 
   - In `require_tenant_aggregate` (lines 50-90) and other similar methods, while exceptions are raised for specific conditions, the overall exception handling appears to be limited. For instance, exceptions related to `AggregateList.get_by_metadata` calls aren't explicitly handled, which could lead to unhandled exceptions if database issues occur. This could be improved by adding more robust exception handling mechanisms.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: 
   - The code does not seem to involve input/output neutralization issues, such as those related to SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**:
    - No obvious violations of coding standards are observed. The code is well-structured and follows standard Python conventions.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written with no major security defects related to the specified CWE categories. However, the aspect of error handling, particularly in scenarios involving database interactions, could be improved for robustness. It's also important to note that a security review should ideally be comprehensive, including aspects like code execution environment, dependencies, and the broader system architecture, which are beyond the scope of this analysis.
