After reviewing the provided code, here are the security defects identified, along with their locations and suggested solutions:

CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):

Lines 24-34 (ids_from_instance function): This function determines user and project IDs based on the context and instance information. However, it does not perform sufficient checks to verify that the user has the appropriate permissions to access or modify the data related to the provided instance.
Solution: Implement more stringent access control checks to ensure that the user has the correct permissions relative to the instance being accessed or modified.
CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):

Lines 89-109 (reserve method in Quotas class): The method takes various parameters, including **deltas, which are then passed to the quota.QUOTAS.reserve method. If **deltas contains user-controlled data, it may lead to injection vulnerabilities.
Solution: Validate and sanitize **deltas to ensure that they contain only the expected types of data and do not allow for injection attacks.
CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):

Lines 102-120 (commit and rollback methods in Quotas class): These methods perform actions only if self.reservations is not empty, but there are no checks for the validity of the data within self.reservations. This could lead to improper handling of corrupt or malicious data.
Solution: Add validation checks to ensure that self.reservations contains valid and expected data before proceeding with commit or rollback operations.
CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):

The TODO comments on lines 37-46 indicate that the code needs cleanup and refactoring. While this is not a direct security issue, it suggests that the code may not adhere to best practices or coding standards, which can indirectly lead to security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Address the TODO items to clean up and refactor the code as indicated, ensuring that it adheres to coding standards and best practices.
CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):

Lines 144-191 (check_deltas method in Quotas class): This method performs various operations and calculations but lacks comprehensive error handling and control flow management for unexpected or erroneous conditions.
Solution: Implement robust error handling and control flow management to handle unexpected situations and erroneous conditions gracefully.
General Observations:

The code makes several external calls to methods in other classes and modules (e.g., quota.QUOTAS.reserve, db.quota_create). Without visibility into these methods, it is challenging to fully assess the security implications of these calls. It is recommended to review these external methods for potential security vulnerabilities as well.
No direct instances of CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities), CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime), CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation), or CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison) were detected in the provided code snippet. However, a thorough review of the entire codebase and its dependencies is recommended for a comprehensive security assessment.
