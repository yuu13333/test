Let's review the provided code for potential security defects:

1. **Uncontrolled subprocess execution**:
    - The code uses subprocess (`Popen` and `check_call`) to execute commands, potentially with dynamic arguments. This can be risky if the arguments aren't properly sanitized or if they come from untrusted sources.
    
    ```python
    docker_pipe = Popen(("docker build - --quiet -t %s" % config.image_name).split(),
                            stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
    ```
    
    **Solution**: Ensure that any data passed to these commands is strictly validated and sanitized. Avoid string interpolation directly into commands. Instead, pass arguments as a list to `Popen` which tends to be safer against command injection.

2. **Potential exposure of sensitive information**:
    - There's a possibility of exposing potentially sensitive information through error messages. When subprocess commands fail, the error is directly printed to the console. 

    ```python
    if stderr:
        print stderr
    ```

    **Solution**: Consider logging errors in a controlled way that doesn't expose sensitive information to unauthorized users or attackers.

3. **File Reading and Dynamic Command Execution**:
    - The code reads file content, processes it, and then potentially uses it in Docker commands:

    ```python
    dummy_str = str_encode_hex(open(copy_file.src, 'r').read())
    ```
    
    Depending on the content of these files, this operation might lead to unexpected behaviors if the file contains malicious content.

    **Solution**: Ensure that files being read are strictly validated and come from trusted sources. The `str_encode_hex` function, which is presumably used for sanitization, should be thoroughly checked to make sure it correctly handles all input and doesn't allow for potentially dangerous outputs.

4. **Environment Variables Usage**:
    - The code checks environment variables and acts based on their values, like here:

    ```python
    if os.environ.has_key("TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL"):
    ```

    If an attacker can control environment variables, this could influence the behavior of the code.

    **Solution**: Be cautious about trusting environment variables. They can be a vector for configuration attacks if an attacker has access to modify them.

5. **Hardcoded script paths and retries**:
    - The path to a script (`/post_startup.py`) and the number of retries (`retry = 60`) are hardcoded:

    ```python
    script = '/post_startup.py'
    retry = 60
    ```

    This isn't directly a security issue, but if the script path changes or if it's moved without updating this code, it could lead to failures. Additionally, hardcoded values can make adjustments (like changing the retry count) more cumbersome.

    **Solution**: Consider externalizing configuration values to a configuration file or environment variables, while ensuring that they're read and used securely.

**Summary**: 
The code does have potential security concerns, primarily related to subprocess execution and the handling of external data (files and environment variables). Proper validation, sanitization, and error handling are critical to prevent these potential vulnerabilities from being exploited.
