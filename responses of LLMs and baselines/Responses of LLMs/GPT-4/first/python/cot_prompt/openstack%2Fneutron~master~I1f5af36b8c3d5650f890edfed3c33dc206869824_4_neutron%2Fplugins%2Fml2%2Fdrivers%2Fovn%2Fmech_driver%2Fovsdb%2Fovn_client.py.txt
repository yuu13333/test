To generate supplementary code files based on the commit message and the given code, I need to understand the specific requirements and context of the project. However, I can provide a general approach to creating supplementary files for the described commit.

### General Approach for Generating Supplementary Code Files

#### Understanding the Commit Message
- **Commit Message:** [ovn] Create neutron_pg_drop port_group by maint. task
- **Key Points:**
  1. Creation of a port group named `neutron_pg_drop`.
  2. The port group is created as part of a maintenance task.
  3. The task is executed once on one controller, guarded by an ovsdb lock.
  4. The default entry for `neutron_pg_drop` port_group is added to a functional base class.

#### Analyzing the Existing Code
- **Existing Code:** Provided code is part of a larger system, probably a networking or OVN component.
- **Identifiable Components:**
  1. OVNClient class with various methods.
  2. Functions to handle OVN transactions, particularly involving ports.

#### Steps to Create Supplementary Files
1. **Identify Required Changes:**
   - Implement a method in `OVNClient` for creating the `neutron_pg_drop` port group.
   - Add logic to execute this method as part of a maintenance task.
   - Ensure the task runs once using an ovsdb lock.
   - Modify the base class to include the default entry for the `neutron_pg_drop` port group.

2. **Create a New Python File (e.g., `maintenance_tasks.py`):**
   - Define a new class or function for the maintenance task.
   - Include logic to acquire an ovsdb lock.
   - Call the method to create the `neutron_pg_drop` port group.

3. **Modify the Base Class (if it's part of the existing code):**
   - Add a new property or method to handle the default `neutron_pg_drop` entry.

4. **Unit Tests:**
   - Write tests to validate the creation of the port group and its default entry.
   - Test the maintenance task under different scenarios, including lock handling.

5. **Integration:**
   - Ensure the new maintenance task is integrated into the system startup or specific workflow where it's needed.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Update the project's documentation to reflect the new changes.

#### Example: Method in OVNClient for Port Group Creation

```python
# In ovn_client.py

class OVNClient(object):
    ...
    def create_neutron_pg_drop_port_group(self):
        # Logic to create the neutron_pg_drop port group
        ...

# Usage in maintenance_tasks.py
from ovn_client import OVNClient

def run_maintenance_task():
    client = OVNClient(...)
    client.create_neutron_pg_drop_port_group()
```

This is a high-level approach and needs to be adjusted based on the actual project structure and requirements.
