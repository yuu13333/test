After analyzing the provided code, here are my observations:

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**:
   The code uses SQLAlchemy's expression language for database operations. This provides protection against SQL injection by default. Specifically, the use of constructs like `sel.where(CONSUMER_TBL.c.uuid == consumer_uuid)` ensures that the input is parameterized and not directly interpolated into the SQL statement, providing a safeguard against SQL injection.
   
2. **Logging**:
   The logger (`LOG.debug`) is used in the code but seems to be only logging the consumer UUID without logging any sensitive information. This is a good practice as logging sensitive data can expose it to unauthorized individuals who have access to the logs.

3. **Error Handling**:
   The code checks for specific error conditions and raises appropriate exceptions. For example, `raise exception.ConsumerNotFound(uuid=uuid)` is used to indicate a specific error condition. This ensures that
