Here is the supplementary Python file, `ovs_retry_patch.py`, with the modified `get_vif_port_by_id` method:

```python
# ovs_retry_patch.py
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential
from oslo_log import log as logging

LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class OVSBridgePatch(OVSBridge):
    
    @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(10), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=0.2, max=2))
    def get_vif_port_by_id(self, port_id):
        """Enhanced method to handle race condition with retries."""
        ports = self.ovsdb.db_find(
            'Interface', ('external_ids', '=', {'iface-id': port_id}),
            ('external_ids', '!=', {'attached-mac': ''}),
            columns=['external_ids', 'name', 'ofport']).execute()
        
        for port in ports:
            if self.br_name != self.get_bridge_for_iface(port['name']):
                continue
            if not self._check_ofport(port_id, port):
                continue
            mac = port['external_ids'].get('attached-mac')
            ovs_vif_port = VifPort(port['name'], port['ofport'], port_id, mac, self)
            LOG.debug("Port %s has VifPort %s", port_id, ovs_vif_port)
            return ovs_vif_port
        
        LOG.warning("Port %s may be processing under the replace procedure, retrying...", port_id)
        raise exceptions.PortNotFound(port_id=port_id)

# Usage
# OVSBridgePatch should be used instead of OVSBridge in the relevant parts of the code
# where get_vif_port_by_id is called to handle race conditions with retry mechanism.
```

This code snippet should be integrated into the existing Python module. The `get_vif_port_by_id` method is now equipped with an enhanced retry mechanism using `tenacity`. This implementation provides exponential backoff for retries and improved logging for each attempt. The `OVSBridgePatch` class extends `OVSBridge`, overriding the specific method that requires the retry mechanism. 

This approach ensures minimal impact on the existing codebase while providing a targeted solution for the identified race condition. The integration of this patch should be tested thoroughly to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new problems.
