Upon careful review of the code provided, a potential security defect has been identified:

### Security Defect:

#### Unauthorized Access:
* **Lines**: 58 - 81 (the `handle_password` function)
* **Description**: The method `handle_password` uses `context.get_admin_context()`, which provides an administrative context without any authentication. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to instance metadata and even modification of system metadata (like passwords).
* **Solution**: It's advisable to use authenticated user contexts, validate permissions, and potentially employ additional checks to ensure the entity making the request is authorized to do so.

To address this security issue, ensure that you:

1. Replace `context.get_admin_context()` with a context that checks and authenticates the incoming request.
2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or another authorization mechanism to check if the user making the request has the necessary permissions to read or modify the instance metadata.

To emphasize: Using an administrative context without proper authentication and authorization checks can expose sensitive information and allow unauthorized modifications. Always ensure you have proper security mechanisms in place when handling such operations.
