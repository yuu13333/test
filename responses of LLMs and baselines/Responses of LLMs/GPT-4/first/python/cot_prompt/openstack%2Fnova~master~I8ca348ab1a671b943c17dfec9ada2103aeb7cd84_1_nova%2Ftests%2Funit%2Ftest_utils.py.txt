After reviewing the provided code, which primarily focuses on unit tests and utility functions within the Nova project, I found no evident security defects. The code mainly deals with unit test cases, utility functions, and mocking techniques, none of which directly interact with external systems, handle sensitive data, or execute operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

Thus, based on the current context and scope of the provided code, it's appropriate to state:

**No security defects are detected in the code.**

It's important to note that a thorough security analysis often requires a broader context, including understanding the overall architecture, data flow, and integration points with other systems or services. In a real-world scenario, additional security reviews, such as dependency scanning, penetration testing, and code audits, are recommended to comprehensively evaluate the security posture of a software project.
