Let's review the code snippet provided to detect potential security defects:

Upon examination, a few areas of potential concern stand out:

1. **Error Disclosure**: 
    - **Lines**: 65-71
    - **Issue**: The `error_application` function is returning a plain-text error message that contains the name of the service and an exception message. Returning detailed error information to the client can leak sensitive information about the system, potentially providing attackers with clues about the system's configuration or state.
    - **Solution**: Instead of returning detailed error information, return a generic error message to the client and log the detailed information server-side for administrative review.

2. **Configuration Files Disclosure**:
    - **Lines**: 38-39
    - **Issue**: The `_get_config_files` function is constructing the paths for configuration files using the environment variable `OS_NOVA_CONFIG_DIR` and known configuration file names. If an attacker can influence the environment or gain access to these paths, they might be able to read or modify configurations.
    - **Solution**: Ensure that environment variables used by the application cannot be tampered with by untrusted users or processes. Additionally, restrict file permissions for the configuration files so that only trusted users and processes can access them.

3. **Dynamic Code Loading**:
    - **Lines**: 102
    - **Issue**: The `deploy.loadapp` function from the `paste` module dynamically loads a WSGI application based on a configuration. If an attacker can influence the configuration source or contents, they might be able to execute arbitrary code.
    - **Solution**: Ensure that the source of configurations loaded by `deploy.loadapp` is trustworthy and not modifiable by untrusted users or processes. Validate any configurations before using them.

It's worth noting that while the code snippet itself provides some points for consideration, the actual risk might be context-dependent. For instance, if this application is not directly exposed to the internet or untrusted users, then the risk might be minimal. However, it's always good practice to follow secure coding standards to anticipate potential threats.
