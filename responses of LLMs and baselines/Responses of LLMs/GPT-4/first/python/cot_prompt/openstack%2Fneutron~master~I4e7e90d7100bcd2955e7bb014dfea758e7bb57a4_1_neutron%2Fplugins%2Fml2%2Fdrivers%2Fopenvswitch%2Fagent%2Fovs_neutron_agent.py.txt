### Supplementary Code File: `ovs_neutron_agent_fix.py`

This file contains the necessary modifications to the `OVSNeutronAgent` class in the Open vSwitch (OVS) Neutron agent implementation to address the bug fix as mentioned in the commit message. The key change is ensuring the `ext_manager.handle_port` method is called after `_bind_devices`.

```python
# ovs_neutron_agent_fix.py

class OVSNeutronAgentFix(OVSNeutronAgent):
    def process_network_ports(self, port_info, ovs_restarted):
        """
        Overridden method to ensure SFC class flows are correctly handled.
        The key change is to call ext_manager.handle_port after _bind_devices.
        """
        failed_devices = {'added': set(), 'removed': set()}
        need_binding_devices = []
        extmgr_handle_devices = []

        # Existing code for handling network ports is maintained...
        # [Code for processing and binding devices]

        # Handling SFC class flows
        for device in extmgr_handle_devices:
            self.ext_manager.handle_port(self.context, device)

        return failed_devices

    def rpc_loop(self, polling_manager=None):
        """
        Overridden main loop to integrate the fixed process_network_ports method.
        """
        # Existing implementation of rpc_loop...
        # Modifications to incorporate the updated process_network_ports...

        while self._check_and_handle_signal():
            # [Existing code for the loop]

            if self._agent_has_updates(polling_manager) or sync or devices_need_retry:
                try:
                    # [Existing code before processing network ports]

                    # Use the updated process_network_ports method
                    failed_devices = self.process_network_ports(port_info, ovs_restarted)

                    # [Existing code after processing network ports]

                except Exception:
                    # [Existing exception handling]

            # [Rest of the loop code]

# Main execution may remain unchanged, but instantiate OVSNeutronAgentFix instead of OVSNeutronAgent
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(bridge_classes)  # Pass appropriate bridge_classes as per the original implementation

```

The `OVSNeutronAgentFix` class extends the original `OVSNeutronAgent` and overrides the `process_network_ports` and `rpc_loop` methods to incorporate the necessary changes for the bug fix. The main execution script would then create an instance of `OVSNeutronAgentFix` instead of `OVSNeutronAgent`.

This supplementary file provides a conceptual solution. For a complete and detailed implementation, further modifications and testing are required within the context of the entire OVS Neutron agent codebase.
