To generate supplementary code files based on the commit message "Cache database and message queue connection objects," I'll write a Python script that implements caching mechanisms for database and message queue connections. This script will be based on the provided code snippet and the commit message's description.

The script will:
1. Implement a cache for database connection objects.
2. Implement a cache for message queue connection objects.
3. Ensure that these objects are reused instead of creating new ones each time.
4. Handle cache invalidation and updates as needed.

Let's start writing the Python script.

```python
import threading
import weakref

# Assuming the existence of a base database connection class and message queue connection class
from database_connection import DatabaseConnection
from message_queue_connection import MessageQueueConnection

class ConnectionCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db_connections = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
        self.mq_connections = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def get_db_connection(self, connection_string):
        with self.lock:
            connection = self.db_connections.get(connection_string)
            if connection is None or not connection.is_valid():
                connection = DatabaseConnection(connection_string)
                self.db_connections[connection_string] = connection
            return connection

    def get_mq_connection(self, connection_string):
        with self.lock:
            connection = self.mq_connections.get(connection_string)
            if connection is None or not connection.is_valid():
                connection = MessageQueueConnection(connection_string)
                self.mq_connections[connection_string] = connection
            return connection

# Usage example
cache = ConnectionCache()

# Get a database connection
db_connection = cache.get_db_connection("db_connection_string")

# Get a message queue connection
mq_connection = cache.get_mq_connection("mq_connection_string")
```

This script creates a `ConnectionCache` class that manages the caching of database and message queue connections. It uses `WeakValueDictionary` for caching, which allows the garbage collector to remove entries when there are no longer any strong references to the cached objects. The `get_db_connection` and `get_mq_connection` methods handle the retrieval and creation of connections, ensuring that existing connections are reused if they are still valid.

This implementation assumes the existence of `DatabaseConnection` and `MessageQueueConnection` classes, which need to be defined elsewhere in your project. The script also includes thread-safety measures to avoid issues in multi-threaded environments.
