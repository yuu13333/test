After analyzing the provided code context, I have identified a potential security defect:

#### Security Defect:
**Command Injection Vulnerability**  
- **Location**: Line 129  
- **Description**: The method `execute` constructs a shell command using string concatenation with a user-provided `pid` in the statement `tasklist | findstr %s' % pid`. This can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands if they control the `pid` value.

- **Solution**: Always avoid constructing shell commands using string concatenation with untrusted input. Instead, use safe methods to execute commands that don't evaluate shell special characters or sequences. If the command has to be constructed dynamically, use command-specific APIs or methods that allow for argument passing without string concatenation.

Modified code:
```python
def process_is_running(pid):
    """Find if the given PID is running in the system."""
    if pid:
        if IS_WINDOWS:
            # Use a list for arguments instead of string concatenation
            output = execute(['cmd', '/S', '/C', 'tasklist', '|', 'findstr', str(pid)],
                             check_exit_code=False, log_fail_as_error=False)
        elif IS_LINUX:
            # ... [rest of the code]
```

Remember that even with these changes, you should always validate and sanitize user inputs, especially if they can affect command execution or system operations. Also, always follow the principle of least privilege â€“ only allow necessary permissions for the operations that the code needs to perform.
