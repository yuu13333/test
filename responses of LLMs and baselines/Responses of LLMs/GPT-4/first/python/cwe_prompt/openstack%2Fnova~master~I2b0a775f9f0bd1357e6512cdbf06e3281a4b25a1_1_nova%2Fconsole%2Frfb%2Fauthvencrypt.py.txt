After reviewing the provided code with the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) as a reference, I identified a potential security defect:

1. **CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**:
   - **Location**: Line 144
   - **Description**: The code specifies `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` as the SSL/TLS protocol version. While TLS 1.2 is considered secure as of my last update in April 2023, specifying a single, fixed version of the TLS protocol can be risky. Over time, as newer and more secure versions are developed, continuing to use an older version might expose the system to vulnerabilities that newer versions have addressed.
   - **Solution**: Instead of hardcoding TLS 1.2, it would be better to use `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS` or a similar method that automatically selects the highest TLS/SSL version supported by the client and the server. This ensures that the system uses the most secure protocol version available.

The rest of the code does not show any obvious security defects based on the CWE. However, it's important to note that security review is a complex process and requires understanding the broader context in which the code is used. This analysis is based on the code snippet provided and might not cover issues that could arise based on how the code interacts with other parts of the system.
