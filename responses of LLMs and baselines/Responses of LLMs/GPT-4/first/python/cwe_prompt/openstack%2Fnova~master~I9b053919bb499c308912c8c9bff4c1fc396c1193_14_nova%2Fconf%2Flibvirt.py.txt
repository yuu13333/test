After reviewing the provided code, I found a potential security defect related to the use of default values for critical configuration options. The defect is not associated with a specific line in the code, but with the overall approach to configuration defaults.

**Security Defect: Insecure Default Settings**

1. **Description**: Several configuration options in the code are set with default values that may not be secure in all environments. For instance, `cfg.BoolOpt('inject_password', default=False, ...)` and `cfg.BoolOpt('inject_key', default=False, ...)`. While these defaults are set to `False`, indicating a safer default state, there are other defaults that might not be secure. The default settings should ideally be set in a manner that promotes security, requiring administrators to explicitly enable potentially risky features.

2. **Solution**: Review all configuration options and assess whether their default values are the safest choice. Insecure features should be disabled by default. Administrators should have to explicitly enable them, ideally after understanding the risks involved. This approach follows the principle of secure defaults.

This observation is more of a best practice recommendation rather than a specific line-by-line code issue. It is crucial to ensure that the system's default state is as secure as possible to avoid unintentional security misconfigurations.
