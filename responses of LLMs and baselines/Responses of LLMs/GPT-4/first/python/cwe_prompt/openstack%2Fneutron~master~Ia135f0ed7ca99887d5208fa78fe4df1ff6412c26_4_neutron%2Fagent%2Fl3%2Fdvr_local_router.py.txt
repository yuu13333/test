After reviewing the provided code snippet, I identified a potential security defect that corresponds to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. 

**Security Defect:**
- **Issue:** Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)
- **Description:** The code defines hard-coded cryptographic constants, which might be used as part of a cryptographic algorithm. Specifically, the `MASK_30` constant on line 33 is a hard-coded value. Hard-coded cryptographic keys and constants can compromise the security of the system, as they are often easily discovered and exploited by attackers.
- **Location:** Line 33.
- **Solution:** Avoid hard-coding cryptographic constants directly in the source code. Instead, use a secure configuration management system to handle such sensitive information, ensuring that these values can be changed without modifying the source code, and are not visible in the codebase.

Additionally, while this specific issue was identified, it's important to note that the code provided is part of a larger system, and other potential security defects may exist that are not immediately visible in this snippet. It's recommended to conduct a thorough security review and use automated tools for a comprehensive analysis. Also, ensure regular updates and patches to all dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
