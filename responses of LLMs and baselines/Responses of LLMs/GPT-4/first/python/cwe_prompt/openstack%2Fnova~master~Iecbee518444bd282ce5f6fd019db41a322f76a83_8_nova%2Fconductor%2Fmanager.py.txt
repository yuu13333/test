After reviewing the provided code, which appears to be a part of the OpenStack Nova project, I identified several potential security defects based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards:

1. **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**
   - **Lines:** 1270-1294 (in function `_fill_provider_mapping`)
   - **Description:** This function processes JSON data (`host_selection.allocation_request`) without validating its structure. Malformed or unexpected JSON data could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
   - **Solution:** Implement input validation to ensure that the JSON data conforms to the expected format before processing it.

2. **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**
   - **Lines:** 1462-1468 (in function `schedule_and_build_instances`)
   - **Description:** The function logs instance details, including potentially sensitive information. If the logging level is improperly configured, this could lead to sensitive data exposure.
   - **Solution:** Review and sanitize logged information to ensure no sensitive data is exposed. Implement proper logging levels and ensure they are configured correctly in production.

3. **CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release**
   - **Lines:** 1586-1598 (in function `_delete_build_request`)
   - **Description:** The code attempts to destroy instances and associated resources, but in the case of failures (e.g., `exception.InstanceNotFound`), it does not have a robust mechanism to ensure that all resources are correctly cleaned up, which might lead to resource leaks.
   - **Solution:** Implement a more comprehensive cleanup mechanism that ensures all resources are properly released even in case of failures.

4. **CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**
   - **Lines:** 1397-1408 (in function `schedule_and_build_instances`)
   - **Description:** The quota recheck mechanism (`CONF.quota.recheck_quota`) could throw exceptions that are not appropriately handled, leading to potential inconsistent states or unhandled application errors.
   - **Solution:** Implement additional error handling around the quota check to manage any exceptions that may arise, ensuring the system remains in a consistent state.

These issues should be addressed to improve the security and robustness of the code. The solutions involve adding input validation, sanitizing logs, ensuring thorough resource cleanup, and handling exceptions more effectively. Additionally, a thorough security review and testing, including static analysis and dynamic analysis, is recommended to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities.
