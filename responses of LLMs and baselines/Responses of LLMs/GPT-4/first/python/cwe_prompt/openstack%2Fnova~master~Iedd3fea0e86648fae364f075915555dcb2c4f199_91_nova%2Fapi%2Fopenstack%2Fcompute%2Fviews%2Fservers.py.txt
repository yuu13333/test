After reviewing the provided code, which appears to be part of the OpenStack Nova project, there are no obvious security defects that stand out based on the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standard. The code primarily deals with the representation layer, formatting and delivering data about virtual server instances.

However, it's important to note that without the context of how this code interacts with the rest of the system, it's difficult to definitively state that there are no security issues. For instance, if the data provided to these methods are not properly validated or sanitized elsewhere, it could lead to security issues like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). But, these concerns are not directly evident from the isolated review of this specific segment of code.

In conclusion, based on the provided code snippet alone: 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
