After reviewing the provided code snippet, which seems to be a part of a WSGI application initialization for Nova APIs, several potential security defects, as per the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards, were identified. Below are the defects, their locations in the code, and suggested solutions:

1. **Hardcoded Configuration File Names (CWE-798):** 
   - **Location:** Line 29.
   - **Description:** The configuration files ('api-paste.ini', 'nova.conf') are hardcoded, which could be a security risk if these files contain sensitive information.
   - **Solution:** Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration management system to handle configuration file names.

2. **Use of Potentially Dangerous Function (CWE-676):**
   - **Location:** Line 36.
   - **Description:** The use of `os.environ` can be potentially dangerous if environment variables are not properly sanitized, as they can be manipulated by an attacker.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that environment variables are properly sanitized and validated before use.

3. **Insecure Temporary File (CWE-377):**
   - **Location:** Lines 34-39.
   - **Description:** The function `_get_config_files` constructs file paths based on environment variables, which might lead to the use of insecure temporary files if not handled properly.
   - **Solution:** Implement secure handling of file paths and consider using secure methods to create temporary files.

4. **Error Handling (CWE-390):**
   - **Location:** Lines 66-70.
   - **Description:** The `error_application` function only provides a basic error message and does not handle exceptions in a detailed manner, which could lead to insufficient logging of errors.
   - **Solution:** Enhance error handling and logging to capture more detailed information about exceptions.

5. **Lack of Input Validation (CWE-20):**
   - **Location:** Line 74.
   - **Description:** The function `init_application` does not perform input validation on the 'name' parameter, which could lead to potential security issues.
   - **Solution:** Implement validation checks on all input parameters to ensure they meet expected formats and values.

6. **Improper Exception Handling (CWE-703):**
   - **Location:** Lines 94-96.
   - **Description:** The exception handling in `_setup_service` call does not differentiate between different types of exceptions, which might obscure underlying issues.
   - **Solution:** Refine the exception handling to properly differentiate and handle different types of exceptions.

It's important to note that these observations are based on a brief review of the code snippet provided. A more thorough code review, ideally as part of a comprehensive security audit, is recommended for a more detailed assessment.
