Upon reviewing the provided code with a focus on security, I identified several potential issues based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards:

1. **Insufficient Input Validation (CWE-20):** 
   - **Description:** The method `_parse_version` in lines 70-74 parses the version string from the client without sufficient validation. If the client sends an improperly formatted string, this could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
   - **Solution:** Implement robust input validation to ensure that the version string adheres strictly to the expected format before parsing it.

2. **Improper Error Handling (CWE-388):**
   - **Description:** In various places (e.g., lines 89-93, 102-104, 113-116, 159-166), the code raises exceptions but does not adequately handle them. This lack of proper error handling could lead to information leakage or denial of service.
   - **Solution:** Implement comprehensive error handling strategies to manage exceptions effectively and avoid leaking sensitive information.

3. **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-259):**
   - **Description:** While not explicit, there is a potential risk if the authentication schemes (line 52) or the communication protocol (e.g., RFB protocol version 3.8 in lines 101, 113) rely on hard-coded values or credentials. This can make the system predictable and vulnerable.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that any credentials or key protocol parameters are configurable and not hard-coded.

4. **Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision (CWE-807):**
   - **Description:** The code relies on client-provided data (e.g., version strings in lines 109, 97) for security decisions without sufficient validation.
   - **Solution:** Always validate and sanitize untrusted inputs before using them in security-critical decisions.

5. **Information Exposure (CWE-200):**
   - **Description:** The detailed error messages (e.g., lines 89-93, 102-104, 113-116) might expose internal state information which could be useful for an attacker.
   - **Solution:** Limit the amount of detail in error messages exposed to clients.

6. **Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190):**
   - **Description:** In line 57, there is a potential for an integer overflow if `message_bytes` is extremely large, as the length is packed into a 4-byte integer.
   - **Solution:** Implement checks to ensure that the size of `message_bytes` does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented in 4 bytes.

It's important to note that while these are potential issues based on the code snippets provided, the actual impact and exploitability can vary depending on the broader context of the application and its implementation.
