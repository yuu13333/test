After reviewing the provided code snippet, here are my observations regarding potential security defects based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards:

1. **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)**: There are no hard-coded credentials such as passwords or cryptographic keys in the code snippet provided.

2. **Buffer Overflows (CWE-120)**: The code does not perform operations like string copying or manipulation that could lead to buffer overflows.

3. **SQL Injection (CWE-89)**: There's no SQL query execution or database interaction code present.

4. **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)**: The code does not generate any web content or handle user input for web applications, hence there's no risk of XSS attacks.

5. **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)**: The code does not directly accept or process user input, so there's no apparent issue with input validation.

6. **Insecure Dependency (CWE-829)**: The code imports `nova.tests.functional` which suggests it's part of a testing suite for the Nova project in OpenStack. Without knowing the security of the imported module, it's impossible to fully assess for insecure dependencies. However, there's no direct indication of insecure dependencies in the provided snippet.

7. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring (CWE-778)**: There's no explicit logging mechanism in the provided code snippet. While this is not directly a vulnerability, insufficient logging can make it difficult to identify and respond to security incidents.

8. **Resource Leak (CWE-404)**: The code does not explicitly manage resources like file handles or network connections, so there's no apparent issue with resource leaks.

9. **Error Handling (CWE-391)**: The method `_resize_and_assert_error` handles errors by asserting the state and content of errors (lines 38-51). This seems appropriate for a test case. 

10. **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)**: The code does not appear to handle sensitive information that could be exposed.

In summary, based on the provided code snippet and using CWE as a reference, **no specific security defects are detected**. However, it's important to note that this assessment is based on the visible portion of the code, and a comprehensive security review would require an understanding of the entire application context, including how this code interacts with other parts of the system.
