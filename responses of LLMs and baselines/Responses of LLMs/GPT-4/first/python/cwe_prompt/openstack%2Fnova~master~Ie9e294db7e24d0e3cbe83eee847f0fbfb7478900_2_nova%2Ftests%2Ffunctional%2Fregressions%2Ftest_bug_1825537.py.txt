Upon reviewing the provided code snippet against the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards, no security defects are detected in the code. 

The code primarily deals with resource allocation and cleanup in a virtualized environment (specifically in the context of resizing operations in a cloud infrastructure). It includes setup and teardown routines, along with failure handling logic to ensure resources are correctly allocated and deallocated during the resize process.

It's important to note that the focus of this code is on functional correctness, particularly in handling errors during resource resizing in a virtualized environment. Security concerns, in this case, would typically involve ensuring that the process does not inadvertently expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access, but such concerns are not directly evident in the provided code snippet. 

However, it's worth mentioning that a complete security review would require examining the broader context in which this code operates, including how inputs are handled, how exceptions are managed, and how resources are controlled and accessed. This snippet, by itself, does not show any explicit security weaknesses as per the CWE standards.
