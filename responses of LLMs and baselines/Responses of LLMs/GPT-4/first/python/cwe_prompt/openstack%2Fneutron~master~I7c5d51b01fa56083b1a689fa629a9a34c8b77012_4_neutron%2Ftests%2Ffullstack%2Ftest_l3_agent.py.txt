After thoroughly reviewing the provided code, I found a security defect related to the use of random numbers for security-critical operations, which is a vulnerability classified under CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values.

**Security Defect Details:**
- **Location:** Line 115, within the function `_test_gateway_ip_changed` in the `TestL3Agent` class.
- **Description:** The code uses `random.randint` to generate a step value that influences the IP addresses (`ip_1` and `ip_2`) in a networking context. Relying on the Python standard library's `random` module for security-critical operations is unsafe, as it is not cryptographically secure and can produce predictable results.
- **Impact:** This could potentially allow an attacker to predict the values generated and exploit this predictability in attacks such as IP address spoofing or session hijacking in a networking context.

**Solution:**
Replace the `random` module with a cryptographically secure random number generator. Python provides the `secrets` module (available in Python 3.6 and later) which is designed for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.

Replace line 17:
```python
import random
```
with:
```python
import secrets
```

And replace line 115:
```python
step = random.randint(1, 50 * attempt)
```
with:
```python
step = secrets.randbelow(50 * attempt) + 1
```

This change ensures that the random values generated for the step variable are cryptographically secure, mitigating the risk of predictability in security-sensitive operations.
