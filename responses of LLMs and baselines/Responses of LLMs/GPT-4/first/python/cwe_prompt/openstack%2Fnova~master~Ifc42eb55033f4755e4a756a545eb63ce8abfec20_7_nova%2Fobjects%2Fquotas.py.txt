After reviewing the provided code, which seems to be a part of a cloud computing platform (possibly OpenStack Nova, given the context and naming conventions), there are a few security concerns to highlight based on the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards:

1. **Insufficient Input Validation (CWE-20):** The methods `reserve`, `commit`, and `rollback` in the `Quotas` class (lines 257-288) do not perform explicit input validation on their parameters. This could potentially lead to issues if the input is not validated elsewhere in the code.

   **Solution:** Ensure that all inputs are validated before being used. This might include checking for null values, ensuring the type and format of the data are as expected, and verifying that the data falls within acceptable ranges.

2. **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The code seems to lack explicit authorization checks in critical functions that manipulate quota (like `create_limit`, `update_limit`, `destroy_all_by_project`, etc.). While the context might include some form of implicit authorization check, it's not apparent in the provided code.

   **Solution:** Implement explicit authorization checks in each function to ensure that the user has the required permissions to perform the operation.

3. **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** While the code appears to use SQLAlchemy for database interactions, which generally helps prevent SQL injection, the absence of raw SQL queries in the provided code means it's less likely to be vulnerable. However, it's always good practice to be cautious.

   **Solution:** Ensure that any dynamic queries are constructed using parameterized queries or other ORM features that safeguard against SQL injection.

4. **Error Handling (CWE-391):** Exceptions are raised in various places in the code without any apparent centralized error handling or logging mechanism (e.g., lines 91-94, 142-143, 152-153). This could lead to information leakage or denial of service.

   **Solution:** Implement a centralized error handling mechanism that logs errors without revealing sensitive information to the user. Also, ensure that the system can gracefully handle errors without crashing or becoming unresponsive.

5. **Use of Hard-Coded Credentials (CWE-798):** There is no direct evidence of hard-coded credentials in the provided code. However, it's a common issue in many applications.

   **Solution:** If applicable, ensure that credentials are not hard-coded into the application code. Use a secure method for managing credentials, such as environment variables or a dedicated secrets management service.

6. **Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639):** The methods for accessing and modifying quotas (like `_get_from_db`, `_update_limit_in_db`, etc.) directly reference database objects without apparent checks for ownership or proper scoping (e.g., lines 81-95, 201-220). This could lead to unauthorized access to data.

   **Solution:** Implement checks to ensure that the requesting user is authorized to access or modify the referenced objects.

Remember, this analysis is based on the visible code snippet and general knowledge of common security practices. A thorough security audit by a professional with access to the entire codebase and its context would be necessary for a comprehensive assessment.
