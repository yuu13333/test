After reviewing the provided code with respect to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards, I identified a potential security issue:

### Security Defect:

1. **Use of Insecure Connection - CWE-319**
   - **Description**: The code includes an option `api_insecure` (line 39) which, when set to `True`, enables insecure SSL (HTTPS) requests to the Glance API. This setting, as described in the comment, can disable verification of the Glance server certificate against the certificate authorities. Disabling SSL certificate verification exposes the system to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
   - **Solution**: It is recommended to enforce secure connections by either removing this option or setting its default to `True` and providing adequate warnings or constraints for changing it. If insecure connections must be supported for some legacy or specific reasons, it should be accompanied by strong warnings and guidelines about the risks involved.

### Recommendations:

- **Enhance SSL/TLS Security**: Ensure that the SSL/TLS implementation is configured with strong cipher suites and proper certificate validation. If there's a legitimate need for disabling SSL verification in some scenarios, provide clear documentation and warnings about the risks and recommend using it only in controlled, secure environments.

- **Code Documentation and Guidelines**: Enhance code documentation to clearly describe the security implications of using insecure connections and the scenarios where it is acceptable or not.

- **Security Best Practices Training**: Ensure that developers are aware of security best practices, especially regarding secure communication protocols and the handling of SSL/TLS configurations.

This analysis focuses on the code as provided, and additional security issues may exist in other parts of the codebase or in how this code interacts with other components in the system. Regular security audits and adherence to secure coding standards are recommended for ongoing security assurance.
