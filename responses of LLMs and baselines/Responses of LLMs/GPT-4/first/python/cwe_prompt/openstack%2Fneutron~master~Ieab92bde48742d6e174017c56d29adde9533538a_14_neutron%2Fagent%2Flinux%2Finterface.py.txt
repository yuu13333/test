After carefully reviewing the provided code, I have identified a security defect related to the handling of system exit in response to a specific condition. The defect is associated with CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions.

**Security Defect Description:**

- In line 74, the code raises a `SystemExit(1)` if the configured MTU is less than the minimum required for IPv6. While it is essential to validate the MTU, the use of `SystemExit` to handle such a configuration error is not advisable in a larger application context. This approach abruptly terminates the program, which might not be the desired behavior in a multi-threaded or multi-process environment. An abrupt termination can lead to incomplete transactions, improper release of resources, or inconsistencies in the state of the application.

**Solution:**

- Instead of using `SystemExit`, it is recommended to raise a custom exception or use an existing relevant exception that can be caught and handled appropriately at a higher level in the application. This approach allows for a more graceful handling of the error condition, such as logging the error, alerting the appropriate personnel, and possibly taking corrective actions without necessarily terminating the entire application. 

    For instance, you can define a custom exception like `InvalidMTUException` and raise it in place of `SystemExit`. The calling code can then catch this exception and take appropriate action. The modified code snippet would look something like this:

    ```python
    class InvalidMTUException(Exception):
        pass

    # ...

    def _validate_network_device_mtu(self):
        if (ipv6_utils.is_enabled() and
            self.conf.network_device_mtu < n_const.IPV6_MIN_MTU):
            LOG.error(_LE("IPv6 protocol requires a minimum MTU of "
                          "%(min_mtu)s, while the configured value is "
                          "%(current_mtu)s"), {'min_mtu': n_const.IPV6_MIN_MTU,
                          'current_mtu': self.conf.network_device_mtu})
            raise InvalidMTUException("Invalid MTU configuration")
    ```

    This change would require additional handling where `_validate_network_device_mtu()` is called, ensuring that the new exception is caught and dealt with appropriately.
