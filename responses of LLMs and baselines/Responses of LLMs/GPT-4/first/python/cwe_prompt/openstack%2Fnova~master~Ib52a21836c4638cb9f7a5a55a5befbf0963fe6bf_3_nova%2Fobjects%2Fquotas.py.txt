Upon reviewing the provided code, I've identified a potential security defect related to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), which corresponds to CWE-932: 'Insecure Direct Object References'.

### Security Defect Details

- **Location**: `ids_from_instance` function, lines 24-34.
- **Description**: This function takes a user context and an instance, then decides which project and user IDs to return based on certain conditions. Specifically, it compares the context's `project_id` and `user_id` with the instance's `project_id` and `user_id`. If they don't match, it returns the instance's IDs. This logic could potentially allow an authenticated user to access or modify other users' data if they can influence the `instance` parameter. This is because the function does not sufficiently verify whether the user has the permission to access or operate on the given instance's project or user ID.

### Proposed Solution

- **Enhanced Access Control Checks**: Modify the `ids_from_instance` function to include more stringent access control checks. Ensure that the user's permissions are verified against the instance's project and user IDs, not just whether the IDs are different.
- **Implement Proper Authorization**: Beyond just authentication (verifying who a user is), ensure that authorization (what a user is allowed to do) is properly implemented. This could involve checking user roles, permissions, or other security policies relevant to the operation.
- **Audit and Logging**: Introduce detailed audit logs for actions performed, especially where sensitive data or critical operations are involved. This can help in tracing any unauthorized or suspicious activities.

It's important to note that IDOR vulnerabilities can be context-dependent and may require thorough examination within the broader application architecture. It would be advisable to perform a comprehensive security audit of the system to identify and remediate any such vulnerabilities.
