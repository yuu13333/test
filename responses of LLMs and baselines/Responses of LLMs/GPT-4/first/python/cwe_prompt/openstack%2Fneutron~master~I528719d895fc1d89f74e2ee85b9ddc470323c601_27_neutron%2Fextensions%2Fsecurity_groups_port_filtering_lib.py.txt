After reviewing the provided code snippet, I found no security defects according to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. The code primarily consists of configuration and metadata definitions for a software extension, including aliases, descriptions, timestamps, and mappings for resources, subresources, and actions. There are no operations or manipulations of data that would typically lead to security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, injection flaws, or improper access controls. The code is largely declarative in nature and does not execute any operations that would typically be associated with security risks.

Key observations:

1. The code does not involve input handling, data processing, or network communication, which are common areas for security vulnerabilities.
2. There are no function definitions or calls, hence no execution flow that could be exploited.
3. The code is primarily setting up constants and configuration data, which are not inherently risky from a security standpoint.

In conclusion, no security defects are detected in the code based on the CWE standards.
