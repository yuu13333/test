After reviewing the provided code, there are no security defects detected based on the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standard. The code mainly consists of function definitions, class definitions, and unit tests, without any apparent security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injections, or cross-site scripting. The use of mock objects and assertions in tests also does not present security risks.

The code is largely focused on testing and utility functions, which typically have a lower risk of security vulnerabilities compared to other areas like data processing, user input handling, or network communication. However, it's important to note that this assessment is based on the visible parts of the code. Security analysis should ideally be part of an ongoing process and include the entire application and its dependencies, not just individual snippets.
