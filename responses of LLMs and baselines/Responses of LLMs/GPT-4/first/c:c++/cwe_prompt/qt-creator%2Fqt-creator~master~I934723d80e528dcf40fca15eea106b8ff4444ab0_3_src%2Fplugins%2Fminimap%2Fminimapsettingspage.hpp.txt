No security defects are detected in the code. 

The provided code snippet is primarily concerned with the declaration of a class `MinimapSettingsPage`, which inherits from `Core::IOptionsPage`. It includes declarations of member variables and methods, but there is no implementation of methods or any explicit operations that could be scrutinized for security weaknesses. Since the code is limited to class and member declarations without actual functional code or logic, it's not possible to assess it for security defects based on the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standard. 

To conduct a thorough security analysis, the actual implementation of methods like `widget()`, `apply()`, and `displaySettingsChanged()` would be necessary, along with any other relevant code that interacts with these methods or manipulates the class's member variables.
