Upon reviewing the provided code, there are no apparent security defects directly relevant to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. The code primarily consists of function definitions and conditional compilation directives related to handling numeric types, mathematical operations, and specific platform or compiler quirks.

The security of this code largely depends on how these functions are used elsewhere in the program. For instance, improper handling of the return values or misuse of these functions in different contexts might lead to vulnerabilities. However, such issues would not be inherent to this code snippet itself but rather in its implementation in a broader application.

It's important to note that this code snippet does not appear to deal with areas typically associated with high security risks, such as network communications, user input handling, memory management, etc. Therefore, it's less likely to contain vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection flaws, or similar weaknesses often cataloged in the CWE.

In summary, 'No security defects are detected in the code' according to the CWE standards within the context of this standalone code snippet. However, caution should be exercised in its implementation to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in a broader system.
