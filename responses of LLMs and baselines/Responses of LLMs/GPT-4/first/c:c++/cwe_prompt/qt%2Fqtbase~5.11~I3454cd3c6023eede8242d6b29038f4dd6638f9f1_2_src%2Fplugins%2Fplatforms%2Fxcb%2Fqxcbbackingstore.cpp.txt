After reviewing the provided code, a potential security defect was identified:

### Security Defect

**Defect Type:** Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
**CWE ID:** CWE-676
**Affected Lines:** 222, 228, 390, 391
**Description:** 
The code uses `shmget()` and `shmat()` for shared memory operations, which can be risky if not properly managed. Specifically, the `shmget()` function at line 222 is used to create a shared memory segment, and `shmat()` at line 228 attaches this segment to the process's address space. If an attacker can control the shared memory segment ID or its parameters, they may manipulate the shared memory in a way that could lead to a denial of service or even arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the `shmdt()` and `shmctl()` functions at lines 390 and 391 are used to detach and remove the shared memory segment, respectively. If not correctly handled, they might lead to dangling pointers or improper resource cleanup.

**Solution:**
1. Validate all inputs controlling the shared memory operations.
2. Implement proper error handling and check return values of `shmget()`, `shmat()`, `shmdt()`, and `shmctl()` to handle failures gracefully.
3. Consider using higher-level abstractions or safer APIs for shared memory operations, if available.
4. Regularly review and audit shared memory management code for potential vulnerabilities.

### Other Considerations
While no other direct security defects were identified, it's crucial to ensure that the overall management of shared memory, including permissions and lifecycle, is handled securely to prevent vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access or memory leaks.
