After reviewing the provided code snippet, which appears to be a part of the Qt framework, specifically related to string conversion, I've identified a potential security concern:

**Potential Security Defect: Use of Unsafe Function (CWE-676, CWE-242):**
- **Location:** Line 56 (`std::memmove(state_data, other.state_data, sizeof state_data);`)
- **Description:** The use of `std::memmove` could be potentially unsafe, especially in contexts where the size of the data being moved is not properly controlled or validated. `std::memmove` is a lower-level function that doesn't perform bounds checking, leading to potential buffer overflows if misused.
- **Solution:** Ensure that the size of `state_data` and `other.state_data` is appropriately controlled and validated before this operation. Additionally, consider using safer alternatives like `std::copy` if applicable and ensure that the sizes of the source and destination buffers are checked to prevent overflows.

**General Note:**
- The code overall appears to follow good C++ practices with the use of modern features like `constexpr`, move semantics, and `noexcept` specifications. It's designed to be part of a larger framework (Qt) and follows its coding conventions and practices.
- The code shows proper encapsulation and use of classes and namespaces, which is good for maintainability and reducing the likelihood of name clashes or unintended interactions between different parts of the code.

Keep in mind that a full security audit would require more context, including how this code interacts with other parts of the system, the overall architecture, and the specific use cases it's intended for.
