After reviewing the provided code, which appears to be a part of the Qt framework specifically dealing with `QPoint` and `QPointF` classes, I found no obvious security defects based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. The code is primarily focused on the definition and implementation of these classes, involving basic operations like constructors, setters, getters, and arithmetic operations.

Key Observations:
- The code does not involve network operations, file handling, or other I/O operations, which are common areas for security vulnerabilities.
- Memory management seems to be handled by the C++ standard, and there are no explicit signs of unsafe memory operations like manual memory allocation or buffer overflows.
- There's no use of external or user inputs that could lead to common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.
- The operations are simple arithmetic or logical operations, and there's no indication of complex algorithms that might be prone to logical errors leading to security vulnerabilities.
- The use of `constexpr` and `noexcept` suggests a focus on compile-time evaluation and exception safety, which are good practices but not directly related to security concerns typically listed in the CWE.

It's important to note that while no vulnerabilities are apparent in this specific snippet, the overall security of a software system also depends on how these classes and methods are used in the broader codebase. Also, the CWE is an extensive list, and it's possible that subtler issues not easily identifiable through a quick review might exist. For a comprehensive security audit, a deeper analysis using automated tools and manual code review in the context of the entire application's architecture would be advisable.
