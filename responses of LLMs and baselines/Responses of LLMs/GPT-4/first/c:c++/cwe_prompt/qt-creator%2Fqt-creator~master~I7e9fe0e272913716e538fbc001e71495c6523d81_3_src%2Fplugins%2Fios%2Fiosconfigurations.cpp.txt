After reviewing the provided code, there are no obvious security defects detectable purely from a static analysis perspective using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference. The code primarily involves configuration and toolchain setup for iOS development in a Qt environment, and it appears to follow good coding practices in terms of handling file paths, string manipulation, and memory management.

However, it's important to note that a thorough security review would typically involve more context, including how the functions are used, the data they process, and the overall architecture of the system. Additionally, dynamic analysis and other testing methodologies would complement this static review to provide a more comprehensive security assessment. 

As it stands, based on the provided snippet and without additional context or dynamic analysis capabilities, no security defects are detected in the code.
