Upon reviewing the provided code, several security defects have been identified in accordance with the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards:

1. **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)**:
    - **Location**: The entire file.
    - **Description**: This code uses Qt which, as of 2016, included some cryptographic algorithms that were considered weak or broken. It's essential to ensure that the Qt version used doesn't rely on these weak algorithms.
    - **Solution**: Update to a more recent version of Qt that uses stronger cryptographic algorithms.

2. **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-94)**:
    - **Location**: Line 159.
    - **Description**: The code constructs a command to launch a URL or document using string concatenation, which can lead to command injection if the URL is not properly sanitized.
    - **Solution**: Use proper escaping or sanitization of the URL before appending it to the command string. Preferably, use Qt's safer APIs to open URLs or documents.

3. **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22)**:
    - **Location**: Lines 94-99.
    - **Description**: The code does not adequately validate user-supplied input in the `desktopSession`. An attacker could exploit this to access or modify files outside of the restricted directory.
    - **Solution**: Implement proper input validation and sanitization to ensure that path traversal cannot occur.

4. **Use of Potentially Dangerous Function (CWE-676)**:
    - **Location**: Line 163.
    - **Description**: The `system()` function is used, which can be dangerous if the command string is not properly sanitized, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.
    - **Solution**: Replace the `system()` call with safer alternatives like `QProcess::startDetached()` or other process management functions that provide better control over command execution.

5. **Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)**:
    - **Location**: The entire file.
    - **Description**: Given the age of the code (2016), there's a potential that the encryption mechanisms used by Qt at that time may not meet current standards.
    - **Solution**: Ensure that the latest Qt libraries are used, and confirm that the encryption mechanisms comply with current security standards.

6. **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') (CWE-400)**:
    - **Location**: Lines 233-239.
    - **Description**: The loop iterates over file descriptors without any explicit upper bound, which might lead to resource exhaustion.
    - **Solution**: Implement limits on the number of iterations or file descriptors that can be opened, and handle errors or exceptions appropriately.

7. **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)**:
    - **Location**: Lines 268-273, 276-278.
    - **Description**: The code might handle URLs or data (especially in the `mailto` scheme) that could contain sensitive information. If not transmitted securely, this information could be exposed.
    - **Solution**: Ensure that all sensitive data is transmitted over secure channels (like HTTPS) and that any sensitive information is encrypted.

8. **Command Injection (CWE-77)**:
    - **Location**: Line 159.
    - **Description**: The construction of a command line that includes untrusted input without validation can lead to command injection.
    - **Solution**: Validate and sanitize the input used in command line construction. Avoid direct execution of user-controllable parameters.

These defects should be addressed to improve the security posture of the code, and it's also recommended to perform a thorough security review with updated tools and practices to identify any other potential vulnerabilities.
