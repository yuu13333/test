After carefully reviewing the provided code, I can confirm that no specific security defects were detected based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards.

The code primarily consists of function definitions, variable declarations, conditional checks, and comments explaining the functionality related to SSL/TLS connections using the Schannel Security Support Provider in Windows. It involves handling certificates, creating secure contexts, managing encryption/decryption processes, and handling various SSL states.

Key observations:

1. The code includes proper checks for function return values and handles potential errors appropriately (e.g., lines 554-560, 634-648).
2. Memory management appears to be handled carefully with the use of `qScopeGuard` for automatic resource cleanup (e.g., lines 471-474, 927-928).
3. The code includes checks for incomplete messages and handles them accordingly (e.g., lines 663-668, 1164-1193).
4. No direct signs of common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or improper input validation were detected.

However, it's important to note that a full security audit would require a deeper analysis, including the context in which these functions are used, how data is passed to them, and the overall architecture of the software. Additionally, security is not just about individual code snippets but also about the overall design, including how the software handles user data, authentication, network communications, error handling, logging, and more.
