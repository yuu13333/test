After reviewing the provided code, which is a part of the Qt framework (specifically related to the `QRect` and `QRectF` classes), no security defects are detected based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standard. The code primarily deals with geometric rectangle operations and does not involve operations typically associated with security vulnerabilities, such as network communication, file system access, or user input handling.

However, it is important to note that this assessment is based on the visible part of the code. Security analysis often requires a broader context, including how the functions are used, the overall architecture, and interaction with other components.

While no security defects are apparent in the provided code, it is recommended to conduct thorough testing and code analysis in a broader context to ensure security, especially in areas not covered by this snippet.
