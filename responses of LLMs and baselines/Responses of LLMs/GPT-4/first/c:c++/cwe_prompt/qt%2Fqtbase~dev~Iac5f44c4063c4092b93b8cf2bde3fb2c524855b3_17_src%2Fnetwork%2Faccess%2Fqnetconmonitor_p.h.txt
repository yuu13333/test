After reviewing the provided code, which appears to be a header file for a Qt network monitoring module, I found no security defects based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standard. This file primarily contains class declarations and function prototypes without any implementation details. CWE typically identifies weaknesses in the implementation of the code rather than its structure or declaration.

The header file defines two classes, `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` and `QNetworkStatusMonitor`, along with their public methods, signals, and private members. It also includes necessary Qt modules and declares a logging category. Since the actual function implementations (where most security defects occur, such as buffer overflows, improper input validations, etc.) are not present in this file, it's not possible to identify any CWE-compliant security defects.

For a thorough security review, the source files (.cpp) where these methods are implemented should be examined, as they are more likely to contain security-relevant code.
