After reviewing the provided code, I identified a potential security defect related to improper input validation, which can be considered under the CWE category CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.

### Security Defect Details:

1. **Vulnerability**: Insecure Regular Expression Input (CWE-20: Improper Input Validation)
   
   - **Location**: Line 422-431
   - **Description**: The code segment in `LineEditField::parseData` (lines 402-435) takes a regular expression pattern from user input (line 421) and compiles it (line 423). If the regular expression is not valid, an error message is set (lines 425-429), but the function returns `false` only in this case, without considering other potential security implications.
   - **Impact**: An attacker could provide a specially crafted regular expression that leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, commonly known as a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack, by causing the application to consume excessive resources while processing the expression.
   - **Solution**: Implement additional checks to ensure the complexity and safety of the provided regular expression. Consider setting a maximum length for the regex pattern and using a regex library that can handle malicious inputs efficiently.

2. **Vulnerability**: Insecure Object Instantiation (CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes)
   
   - **Location**: Line 999-1002
   - **Description**: The `createFieldData` method (lines 998-1003) creates an object based on a type string that could potentially be influenced by user input. This method looks up a factory function in a map and creates an object of the corresponding type.
   - **Impact**: If the type string can be influenced by an attacker, this might lead to object instantiation of an unexpected type, potentially leading to security issues depending on the context and use of these objects.
   - **Solution**: Ensure strict validation of the `type` string against a predefined list of allowed types. Consider using an enumeration instead of string comparison for type checking, and apply secure coding practices to validate all user inputs.

Please review these sections of the code to address the mentioned vulnerabilities. Implementing thorough input validation and adopting a secure coding mindset are crucial steps in mitigating such risks.
