After reviewing the provided code, which is a part of the Qt Toolkit's file system engine, no obvious security defects were detected based on the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard. The code appears to follow good practices for system calls and file system operations, including checks for errors and proper handling of different operating systems and file system features.

It's important to note, however, that without the context of how these functions are used and the overall architecture of the system, this assessment can't guarantee the absence of security defects. Security vulnerabilities often arise from the interaction between different parts of a system, and not just from individual components. Thus, a comprehensive security review should include an analysis of the system as a whole, including how this code interacts with other components.
