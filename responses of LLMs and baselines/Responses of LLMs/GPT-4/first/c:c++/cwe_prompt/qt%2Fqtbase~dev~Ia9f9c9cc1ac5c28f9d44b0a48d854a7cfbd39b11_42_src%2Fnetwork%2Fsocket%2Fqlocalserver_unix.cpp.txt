After reviewing the provided code, I did not find any explicit security defects based on the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standard. The code primarily handles socket connections, error handling, and state changes, and it seems to follow good practices for these operations. However, it is important to note that this is a high-level review and certain types of vulnerabilities, such as those requiring deep analysis of the underlying logic or dependencies, might not be easily detectable through a code review alone. 

If this code is part of a larger application, it's recommended to perform comprehensive security testing, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and penetration testing, to uncover potential vulnerabilities that might not be evident through code review alone. Additionally, ensuring secure coding practices and keeping dependencies up to date are essential steps in maintaining the security of the application.
