Upon reviewing the provided code, which is part of the QtCore module of the Qt Toolkit, focusing on mathematical functions and constants, I found no security defects based on the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards. The code primarily consists of mathematical function templates, constants definitions, and utility functions for mathematical operations. 

Each function uses standard C++ library calls (like `std::sin`, `std::cos`, `std::sqrt`, etc.) and follows good programming practices for type safety and clarity. The code does not seem to involve any operations that are typically associated with common security weaknesses, such as buffer overflows, improper input validation, or use of unsecured external resources.

The use of templates ensures type safety, and the mathematical operations performed do not present any obvious risks for overflow or underflow that are not already handled by the standard library functions. Moreover, there are no network or file operations, no handling of user input, and no indications of memory mismanagement, all of which are common sources of security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, I conclude: 'No security defects are detected in the code'.
