After reviewing the provided code, no security defects are detected based on the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standard. The code primarily deals with calendar-related functionality and includes various checks and validations which seem appropriate for the operations being performed. 

The code is well-structured and appears to follow good programming practices, such as:

- Proper use of namespaces and encapsulation (lines 52-129, 131-134, etc.).
- Usage of global static variables to manage resources and avoid unnecessary re-instantiation (lines 131-134).
- Checking for valid states before proceeding with operations (e.g., lines 555-556, 573-574, 592-593, etc.).
- Use of assertions to validate assumptions in debug builds (e.g., line 99).

However, it's important to note that a full security audit would involve more than just reviewing the code for CWE compliance. It would also include analyzing the context in which this code is used, the overall architecture, and how data flows through the system. Additionally, testing for potential runtime issues such as race conditions or memory leaks would be crucial for a complete security assessment.
