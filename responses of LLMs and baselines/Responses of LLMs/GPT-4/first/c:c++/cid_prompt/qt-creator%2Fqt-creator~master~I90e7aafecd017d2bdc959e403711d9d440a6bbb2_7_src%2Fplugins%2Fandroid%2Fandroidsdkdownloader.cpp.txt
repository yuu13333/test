After reviewing the provided code for potential security defects in the context of the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories you've mentioned, I've identified a few areas of concern:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**:
   - **Line 57-68 (setSdkFilesExecPermission function)**: The function `setSdkFilesExecPermission` modifies file permissions to add executable rights. This could lead to security vulnerabilities if executed on untrusted files. It's important to ensure that this functionality is applied only to trusted files and that appropriate checks are in place to prevent misuse.

2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
   - **Line 120-126 (extractSdk function)**: The `QProcess` used for extracting the SDK is created with `new` but not deleted after use, which could lead to a memory leak. It's recommended to manage the lifecycle of `QProcess` properly, preferably using smart pointers or ensuring deletion after use.

3. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**:
   - **Line 49-54 (sslErrors function)**: The handling of SSL errors could be insufficient. Merely logging SSL errors without taking further action could lead to security issues, especially if SSL errors indicate potential man-in-the-middle attacks. A more robust handling strategy should be employed.

4. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**:
   - **Line 116-119 (extractSdk function)**: The code constructs a command line for jar extraction using file paths. If these paths are not properly sanitized or validated, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. It's essential to ensure that inputs are properly sanitized before use in such contexts.

5. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**:
   - **General Observation**: The code lacks comprehensive error handling and input validation in several places. This lack of robustness can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.

Solutions:
- For **CWE-284**: Implement strict validation to ensure that only trusted files are given executable permissions.
- For **CWE-664**: Use smart pointers or ensure proper deletion of dynamically allocated resources.
- For **CWE-693**: Implement more robust SSL error handling, potentially aborting connections on certain types of SSL errors.
- For **CWE-707**: Sanitize and validate all inputs used in command line construction.
- For **CWE-710**: Adopt a coding standard that emphasizes robust error handling and input validation.

No explicit issues were detected related to CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities), CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation), CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management), CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison), or CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions) in the provided code.
