After reviewing the provided code snippet, I found several security defects corresponding to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories you mentioned. Here's a detailed analysis:

### CWE-284: Improper Access Control
1. **Line 248-250:** The creation of a new `VcsCommand` object with parameters from external sources (like `workingDirectory()` and `processEnvironment()`) could potentially allow unauthorized access if not properly validated or sanitized.

### CWE-435: Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities
1. **Lines 113-118:** The connections established using Qt's `connect` function might lead to improper interactions if the signals and slots mechanism is not correctly used or if the connected entities behave unexpectedly.

### CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
1. **Lines 108-118, 180-188:** The `VcsCommandResultProxy` class is designed to manage the lifetime of connections to signals from a `VcsCommand`. If the destruction of the proxy or the command is mishandled, it can lead to issues in resource management.

### CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation
1. No specific instances detected.

### CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
1. **Line 210-218:** The handling of the `m_commandResultProxy` in the `commandFinished` method lacks sufficient control flow checks, which might lead to unexpected behavior if the command or proxy is in an unexpected state.

### CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
1. **Line 181-183, 191-193:** The `cancelReload` method attempts to cancel commands and processes, but if these cancellations fail or aren't handled correctly, it could lead to a failure in the intended protection mechanisms.

### CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison
1. **Lines 144, 148-149, 151-153:** The use of comparisons in `processingFinished` could lead to incorrect behavior if the state of `m_processWatcher` or its `future` is not as expected.

### CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
1. **Lines 144, 181-196:** The `cancelReload` method and the destructor of `VcsBaseDiffEditorControllerPrivate` do not adequately check or handle potential exceptional conditions, like null pointers or failed cancellations.

### CWE-707: Improper Neutralization
1. **Line 248-256:** The construction of a `VcsCommand` object with potentially external input could lead to improper neutralization if the input is not properly sanitized, especially in the context of command execution.

### CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards
1. General code structure and error-handling practices in this code do not fully adhere to robust coding standards, which could lead to various security issues.

#### Recommendations:
- **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Ensure all inputs used in command creation and other processes are properly validated and sanitized to prevent unauthorized access or execution.
- **Resource Management:** Review the lifetime control of resources like `VcsCommand` and proxies to ensure they're managed safely.
- **Error Handling:** Improve error handling and control flow checks to handle exceptional conditions more robustly.
- **Coding Standards:** Refactor the code to adhere to best practices in coding standards, focusing on security and robustness.
