After carefully reviewing the provided code, here are my findings regarding potential security defects based on the specified Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: No obvious issues related to improper access control are observed in the code. The functions and methods seem to have appropriate visibility and access levels.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: The code does not show apparent improper interactions between multiple entities. The interactions between OpenGL functions and contexts appear to be handled correctly.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: There's a potential issue in lines 57-67 where resources (external functions) are being managed. If the deletion of these resources is not handled correctly in all scenarios, it could lead to resource leaks or use-after-free vulnerabilities. Proper control of these resources throughout their lifetime is crucial.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: No obvious miscalculations are present in the code.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: The code does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient control flow management. The flow of the program seems to be managed adequately.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: There is no direct indication of protection mechanism failure in the provided code.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: The code does not contain any obvious incorrect comparisons.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: The code may not adequately handle exceptional conditions. For instance, in lines 104-121 and 123-151, the handling of backend objects and memory allocations could be problematic if exceptions occur or if allocation fails.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: There's no clear indication of issues related to improper neutralization in the context of this code.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: While this is subjective to the specific coding standards in place, the code appears to follow good coding practices in general.

To address the potential issue in CWE-664, ensure that the resource management is robust against all possible use cases, including exceptions and unusual control flows. For CWE-703, adding more comprehensive checks and error handling for memory allocations and object lifecycle management could mitigate potential risks.
