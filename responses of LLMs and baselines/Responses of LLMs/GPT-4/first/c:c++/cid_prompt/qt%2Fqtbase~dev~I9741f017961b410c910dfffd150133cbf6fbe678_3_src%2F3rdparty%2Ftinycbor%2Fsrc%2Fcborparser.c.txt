After reviewing the provided code, which is part of a library for parsing CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) data, here are the identified security defects, corresponding to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories:

1. **CWE-665: Improper Initialization (line 345, 347-350, 357-362)**
   - **Description**: The `cbor_parser_init` and `cbor_parser_init_reader` functions (lines 343 and 355) initialize the `CborParser` and `CborValue` structures. However, they only partially initialize these structures, potentially leaving some parts uninitialized.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that all fields in the `CborParser` and `CborValue` structures are properly initialized before use.

2. **CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (line 1119, 1022-1039)**
   - **Description**: The function `get_string_chunk_size` (line 987) calculates the size of a string chunk but does not properly check if the calculated size exceeds the bounds of the buffer. This could lead to an out-of-bounds write.
   - **Solution**: Add bounds checking to ensure the calculated string chunk size does not exceed the buffer size.

3. **CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (line 1221)**
   - **Description**: The function `iterate_string_chunks` (line 1197) does not properly handle integer overflow when calculating `newTotal`. This could lead to an integer overflow and potentially to buffer overflows or incorrect memory operations.
   - **Solution**: Implement overflow checks when performing arithmetic operations, particularly in size calculations.

4. **CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (line 1072)**
   - **Description**: In the function `get_string_chunk` (line 1050), there is a potential miscalculation of buffer size due to not accounting for null termination or other factors in buffer size calculations.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that all buffer size calculations account for the maximum possible size, including any additional characters or data that may be added (such as a null terminator).

5. **CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (line 1197, 1200-1207)**
   - **Description**: The function `iterate_string_chunks` uses a pointer `next` which, if NULL, can lead to a NULL pointer dereference.
   - **Solution**: Add null checks for pointers before dereferencing them.

These issues can lead to various security problems, such as crashes (Denial of Service), unauthorized memory access, or even potentially execution of arbitrary code, depending on the context in which the library is used. It's important to address these issues to ensure the robustness and security of the software.
