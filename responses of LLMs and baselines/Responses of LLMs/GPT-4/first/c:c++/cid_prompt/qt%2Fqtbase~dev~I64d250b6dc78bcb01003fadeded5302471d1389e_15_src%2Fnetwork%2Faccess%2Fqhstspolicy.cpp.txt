After reviewing the provided code, which appears to be a part of the QtNetwork module of the Qt Toolkit, focusing on the implementation of HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy, I did not identify any specific security defects related to the specified Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). Here is a summary:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: The code does not show any explicit access control mechanisms, and the functionality seems to be related to managing HSTS policies, which is not directly associated with access control.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: The code mostly deals with the management of HSTS policies. It does not show interactions between multiple entities that could lead to security issues.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: The code handles resource control adequately, especially with the use of private data members in a class and proper constructors and destructors.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: There are no complex calculations presented in the code that could be prone to errors.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: The code does not exhibit complex control flows or decision-making processes that could be mismanaged.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: This code is about implementing a protection mechanism (HSTS) and does not itself demonstrate any failure in existing protection mechanisms.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: The comparison operations, like the one in line 203 (`operator==`), seem to be correctly implemented, comparing relevant fields of the HSTS policy.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: The code does not appear to involve exception handling or checks for exceptional conditions that are improperly handled.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: There is no evidence of issues related to the neutralization of special elements, such as in input validation or output encoding.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The code follows a consistent style and adheres to typical C++ coding practices as seen in Qt framework modules.

In conclusion, no security defects are detected in the code with respect to the specified CWE categories. It's important to note that this analysis is based on the provided snippet, and a comprehensive security audit would require reviewing the entire module and its interactions with other parts of the system.
