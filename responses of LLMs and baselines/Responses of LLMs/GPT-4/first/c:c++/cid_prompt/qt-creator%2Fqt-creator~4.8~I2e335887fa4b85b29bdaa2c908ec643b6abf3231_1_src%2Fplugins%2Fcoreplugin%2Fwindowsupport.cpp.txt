After reviewing the provided code, here are the observations related to the security defect categories mentioned:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: 
   - No apparent improper access control issues are observed in the code. The functions and actions seem to have appropriate access controls in place.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: 
   - The code seems to manage interactions between entities (like windows, actions, and events) properly. There's no clear indication of improper interaction.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: 
   - The destructor in lines 88-100 ensures proper cleanup if the window is not shutting down. This suggests good resource control throughout its lifetime.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**:
   - There are no complex calculations that could be prone to errors in this code segment.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**:
   - Control flow seems to be managed adequately, with checks and balances like in line 110 (checking if object is the window and if shutdown is not in progress).

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**:
   - There's no clear failure of protection mechanisms in the provided code.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**:
   - The comparisons made in the code, such as in line 110 (`obj != m_window`) and line 112 (`event->type() == QEvent::WindowStateChange`), appear to be correct and contextually appropriate.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**:
   - Exceptional conditions seem to be handled properly. For example, the destructor checks whether the application is shutting down before proceeding with cleanup.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**:
   - There is no input from an untrusted source that would require neutralization to prevent security risks like injection attacks.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**:
    - The code seems to follow standard coding practices for Qt C++ applications.

Based on this analysis, **no security defects are detected in the code** according to the specified CWE categories.
