Upon reviewing the provided code snippet, here are my observations regarding potential security defects categorized by the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: No specific instances of improper access control are evident in the provided code snippet.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: No clear signs of improper interactions between multiple entities are present in this code segment.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: There are no apparent issues with resource management in the given code. The use of `QPointer` and appropriate destruction of objects suggests proper handling.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**:
   - **Line 76**: There's a potential issue in the calculation of the median. The condition `(size % 2)` will result in selecting the `half + 1` element for even-sized arrays, which is incorrect. The median for even-sized arrays should be the average of the two middle elements, typically `durations[half - 1]` and `durations[half]`. The existing calculation could lead to incorrect median values.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: The code seems to manage control flow adequately, with no obvious deficiencies in this aspect.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: There's no evident failure in implementing necessary protection mechanisms in the provided code.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: The code does not appear to have issues with incorrect comparisons.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: The code does not exhibit any improper handling of exceptional conditions. However, without seeing the full implementation, it's hard to fully assess exception handling.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: There are no indications of issues related to improper neutralization in this code segment.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The code generally follows good coding practices, although there might be some inconsistencies or improvements possible, such as better documentation or handling of edge cases. However, these do not pose security risks per se.

**Solution for CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**:
- Modify line 76 to correctly compute the median for even-sized arrays. The corrected line should be:
  ```cpp
  median = (size % 2) ? durations[half] : ((durations[half - 1] + durations[half]) / 2ll);
  ```

This change ensures that the median is calculated accurately for both even and odd-sized arrays.
