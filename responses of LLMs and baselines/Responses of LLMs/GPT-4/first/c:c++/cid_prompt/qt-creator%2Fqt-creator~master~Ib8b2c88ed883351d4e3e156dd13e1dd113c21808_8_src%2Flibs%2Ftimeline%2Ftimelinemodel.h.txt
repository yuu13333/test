After reviewing the provided code, I found it to be generally well-structured and did not identify any explicit security defects corresponding to the specified Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. Here's an overview:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** The code includes several properties and methods that are appropriately scoped (`public`, `protected`, `private`) and many methods are tagged with `Q_INVOKABLE`, indicating controlled access for QML. There doesn't seem to be improper access control.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):** The code does not show explicit interaction between multiple entities that could lead to security defects.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):** Resource management, particularly memory management, is not explicitly shown in the snippet. The use of a private pointer (`d_ptr`) suggests encapsulation of data, which is a good practice, but without further details, it's difficult to assess resource control through its lifetime.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):** The code does not include complex calculations where inaccuracies are evident. Functions like `duration`, `startTime`, `endTime`, etc., are likely to rely on underlying data without performing intricate calculations.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):** Control flow appears to be well-managed, with clear method definitions and signal handling. No evident defects in control flow management are present.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):** There's no indication of reliance on a protection mechanism that fails or is insufficient.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):** The provided code does not include explicit comparisons that could be considered incorrect.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** Exception handling is not explicitly covered in this code. Qt relies on its error handling mechanisms, and this code does not show any improper checks or handling of exceptional conditions.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):** The code does not seem to handle inputs that need neutralization, such as user input being incorporated into SQL queries, thereby avoiding risks of injection attacks.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):** The code follows the Qt coding standards, with proper use of Qt macros, signals, and properties.

In conclusion, no security defects are detected in the code based on the provided snippet and the specified CWE categories. However, it's important to note that a complete security review often requires a broader context and understanding of how this code interacts with other components of the system.
