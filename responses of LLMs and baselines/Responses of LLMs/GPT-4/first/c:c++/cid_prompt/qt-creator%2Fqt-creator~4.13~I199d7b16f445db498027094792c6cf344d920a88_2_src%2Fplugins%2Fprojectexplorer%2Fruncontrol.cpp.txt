After reviewing the provided code, I found several security defects corresponding to different Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**:
    - **Defect**: The global variables `g_runWorkerFactories`, `g_runModes`, and `g_runConfigs` (lines 76-79) are accessed and modified without any synchronization mechanisms like mutexes. This could lead to race conditions when accessed by multiple threads, leading to improper access control.
    - **Solution**: Implement thread synchronization mechanisms like mutexes when accessing and modifying these global variables.

2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
    - **Defect**: In `RunControlPrivate` destructor (lines 286-293), there is a potential for improper management of the lifetime of member objects. If the `RunControlPrivate` object is destroyed while its member `RunWorker` objects are still in use or executing, it could lead to undefined behavior.
    - **Solution**: Ensure proper management of object lifetimes and dependencies, possibly using smart pointers or explicit management of object states and lifecycles.

3. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**:
    - **Defect**: In `RunWorker::userMessageForProcessError` (lines 1541-1571), the error message construction uses data from the `FilePath` object without proper neutralization or validation. If the `FilePath` contains unexpected or malicious content, it could lead to issues like incorrect error messages or, in a worst-case scenario, injection vulnerabilities.
    - **Solution**: Validate and sanitize the input from `FilePath` before using it in error message construction.

4. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**:
    - **Defect**: In several places, such as `RunControlPrivate::continueStart` (lines 529-569) and `RunControlPrivate::continueStopOrFinish` (lines 582-640), there is complex control flow with multiple nested conditions and state checks. This complexity could lead to insufficient control flow management, making the code prone to bugs and logic errors.
    - **Solution**: Simplify control flow, refactor complex functions into smaller, more manageable ones, and use state patterns where applicable.

5. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**:
    - **Defect**: The use of raw pointers and manual memory management in many places (e.g., `RunWorkerPrivate` constructor, line 1277) might not adhere to modern C++ best practices, which recommend using smart pointers for automatic memory management.
    - **Solution**: Refactor the code to use smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) instead of raw pointers to ensure better memory management and to adhere to modern coding standards.

Other CWE categories listed (CWE-435, CWE-682, CWE-693, CWE-697, CWE-703) do not show explicit defects in the examined code segment. However, without the entire context of the application, some issues might not be apparent from this specific excerpt. It is always recommended to perform a comprehensive security review and consider other types of analysis, like dynamic analysis, for a complete security assessment.
