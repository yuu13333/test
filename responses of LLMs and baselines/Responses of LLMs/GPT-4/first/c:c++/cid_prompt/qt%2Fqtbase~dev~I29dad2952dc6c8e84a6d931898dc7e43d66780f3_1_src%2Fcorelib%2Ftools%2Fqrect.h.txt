After reviewing the provided code, which is a part of Qt's `QRect` and `QRectF` class implementations, no clear security defects in terms of the specified Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) were identified. The code mostly consists of geometric calculations and member functions for managing rectangles, without direct interaction with external systems, files, or network resources that are commonly associated with security vulnerabilities.

Specifically, here are the observations with respect to the mentioned CWE categories:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** The code does not involve access control mechanisms.
2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):** This code primarily deals with rectangle properties and does not involve interactions between multiple entities or systems.
3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):** There is no explicit management of resources like memory or file handles in this code snippet.
4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):** The calculations in the code are geometric in nature and there are no evident logical errors in these calculations.
5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):** The control flow in the functions seems appropriate for the operations they are performing.
6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):** There are no explicit protection mechanisms like encryption, authentication, etc., in this part of the code.
7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):** Comparisons in the code (like in `operator==` and `operator!=`) are consistent with the functionality of the class.
8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** Exception handling is not a part of this code, and it does not appear to fail to check or handle exceptional conditions.
9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):** The code does not deal with input neutralization as it's not processing external inputs in a way that's typically associated with vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting.
10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):** Without specific coding standards to reference, it's difficult to identify any non-adherence issues in this context.

In conclusion, based on the provided snippet, no security defects are detected in the code. However, it's important to note that this analysis is limited to the provided code segment and does not account for how this code interacts with other parts of the software or system.
