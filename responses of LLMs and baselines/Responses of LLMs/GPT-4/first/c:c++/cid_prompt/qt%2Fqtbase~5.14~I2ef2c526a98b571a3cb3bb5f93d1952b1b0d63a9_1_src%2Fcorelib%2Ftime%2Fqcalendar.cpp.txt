After reviewing the provided code, which is part of the Qt Framework and deals with calendar functionality, here are the security defects identified according to the specified CWE categories:

1. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):**
    - **Defect:** The destructor `QCalendarBackend::~QCalendarBackend()` (line 185) doesn't explicitly release resources or memory which might lead to resource leaks.
    - **Solution:** Implement a destructor that properly releases any allocated resources to prevent memory leaks.

2. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**
    - **Defect:** In `QCalendarBackend::dayOfWeek(qint64 jd) const` (line 436), the calculation of the day of the week might not be accurate for all calendar systems. This method uses a calculation based on the Hebrew calendar, which might not apply to other calendar systems.
    - **Solution:** Ensure that `dayOfWeek` is correctly overridden in subclasses to provide accurate calculations for different calendar systems.

3. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):**
    - **Defect:** In `QCalendarBackend::fromEnum(QCalendar::System system)` (lines 616-646), there's a lack of control flow for unexpected or unsupported calendar systems.
    - **Solution:** Add more robust error handling and control flow management to deal with unsupported or unexpected input.

4. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):**
    - **Defect:** Functions like `QCalendarBackend::registerAlias(const QString &name)` (line 569) and `QCalendarBackend::fromName(QStringView name)` (line 588) do not perform sufficient checks or sanitization on the input names. This could potentially lead to issues if the input is not properly validated or sanitized.
    - **Solution:** Implement input validation and sanitization for these functions to ensure that the input meets the expected format and content.

5. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):**
    - **Defect:** There are a few instances where the code might not adhere to best practices or coding standards, for example, the use of raw pointers and manual memory management.
    - **Solution:** Refactor the code to use smart pointers and modern C++ memory management techniques to reduce the risk of memory leaks and improve code safety.

The other CWE categories (284, 435, 693, 697, 703) do not seem to have direct issues in this code snippet. It is important to note that thorough testing and code analysis should be conducted to uncover any deeper or less obvious issues, especially in a complex library like Qt.
