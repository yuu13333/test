After reviewing the provided code, there are no apparent security defects related to the specified CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration). Here is a summary of the examination:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** There are no obvious issues with access control. The functions and data seem to be properly encapsulated within their respective classes, and there's no evidence of unauthorized access to resources.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):** The code does not appear to have any problematic interactions between different entities. The functions and classes interact in a typical manner expected for a graphical interface system.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):** Resources like `m_compositor` are created and destroyed in a controlled manner (lines 54, 66). There's no indication of resource mismanagement over their lifetime.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):** The calculations in the code, such as device pixel ratio calculation and screen geometry settings (lines 120-127, 162-167), appear to be correct and standard for screen handling.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):** The control flow in the code, including checks and function calls, seems adequate and there's no apparent evidence of insufficient control flow management.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):** The code does not seem to disable or incorrectly implement any necessary protection mechanisms.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):** The comparisons made in the code, such as checking for `undefined` values (line 112), are appropriate for the context.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** The code handles its operational scope well, with no evident improper checks or handling of exceptional conditions.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):** There's no evidence of improper neutralization issues like injection flaws in the provided code snippet.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):** The code adheres to standard coding practices for Qt and C++ and does not show any obvious deviations from coding standards.

In conclusion, based on the provided snippet, no security defects are detected in the code related to the specified CWE categories.
