After reviewing the provided code, I did not detect any security defects related to the specified Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. The code seems to be well-structured and follows good practices in terms of access control, resource management, control flow, and exception handling.

Specifically:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: The code does not expose any functionality that seems improperly accessible or lacks access control.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: There are no apparent interactions between entities that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: Resource management is handled properly, with no apparent misuse of resources throughout their lifecycle.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: There are no evident miscalculations that could result in security vulnerabilities.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: Control flow throughout the code is well managed and does not exhibit any weaknesses.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: The code does not appear to fail in implementing necessary protection mechanisms.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: Comparisons in the code are correctly implemented without leading to security issues.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: Exceptional conditions seem to be checked and handled appropriately.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: There is no indication of improper neutralization of inputs that could lead to security risks.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The code adheres to standard coding practices without apparent deviations that could lead to security defects.

However, it is important to note that a comprehensive security review would require more in-depth analysis, including understanding the broader context in which this code operates, the dependencies it relies on, and how it interacts with other parts of the system. Additionally, static code analysis using specialized tools could provide further insights into potential hidden vulnerabilities.
