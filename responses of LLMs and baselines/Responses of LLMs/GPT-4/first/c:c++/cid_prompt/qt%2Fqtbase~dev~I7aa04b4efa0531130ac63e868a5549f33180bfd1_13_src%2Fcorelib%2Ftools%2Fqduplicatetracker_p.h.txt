After reviewing the provided code, here are my observations regarding potential security defects categorized by the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers you've listed:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: No evident issues. The class and its methods seem to have appropriate access levels.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: No evident issues. The class `QDuplicateTracker` does not appear to interact improperly with other entities.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: No evident issues. Resource management, especially memory, is handled properly using `std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource` and `std::pmr::unordered_set`.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: No evident issues. The calculations, mainly for bucket sizes in hash tables, are based on prime numbers and seem logically sound.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: No evident issues. The control flow in the code appears to be well-managed, with clear and deterministic paths.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: No evident issues. The code does not seem to disable or bypass any protection mechanisms.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: No evident issues. The comparisons made in the code, particularly in functions like `hasSeen`, are appropriate for their use cases.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: No evident issues. Exceptional conditions, especially related to memory allocation and container operations, are handled by the underlying C++ standard library constructs.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: No evident issues. The code does not involve operations where neutralization of special elements is typically a concern (e.g., user input handling, SQL queries).

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: No evident issues. The code adheres to common C++ coding standards and practices. 

In summary, the code appears to be well-written with no obvious security defects in the context of the specified CWE categories. However, it is important to note that a comprehensive security review often requires a deeper understanding of the broader software context in which this code operates.
