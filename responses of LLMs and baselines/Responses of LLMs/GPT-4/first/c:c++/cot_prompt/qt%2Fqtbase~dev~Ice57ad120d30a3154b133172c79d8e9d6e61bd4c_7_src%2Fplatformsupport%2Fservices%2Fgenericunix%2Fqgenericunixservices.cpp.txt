To create supplementary code files based on the provided commit message, we need to understand the intent of the commit and how it integrates with the existing code. The commit message indicates the addition of support for OpenURI and Email Flatpak portals in a Qt application. This support involves DBus calls, which are then caught and forwarded by the `xdg-desktop-portal` daemon/service, and is specifically targeted at Qt applications running in a sandbox.

The existing code appears to be part of a Qt plugin, likely dealing with system services and inter-process communication, as indicated by the inclusion of DBus and process-related headers.

Given this context, supplementary code files might include:

1. **FlatpakPortalService.h**: This header file would define a class `FlatpakPortalService`, encapsulating the logic for interacting with Flatpak portals via DBus. It would declare methods for opening URLs and sending emails through the Flatpak portals.

2. **FlatpakPortalService.cpp**: The implementation of the `FlatpakPortalService` class. This would include the actual DBus calls for the OpenURI and Email portals, error handling, and any necessary utility functions.

3. **DBusInterfaceDefinitions.h**: This header would contain the necessary DBus interface definitions and constants required for interacting with the `xdg-desktop-portal` service.

4. **TestFlatpakPortalService.cpp**: A test file containing unit tests for the `FlatpakPortalService`, ensuring that the DBus calls are made correctly and that the service behaves as expected under different scenarios.

5. **Documentation**: A markdown or similar document explaining how to use the new Flatpak portal support in Qt applications, including examples and best practices.

These files would provide a structured approach to implementing and testing the new Flatpak portal support as described in the commit message. The actual implementation would depend on the broader architecture of the Qt system and the specific requirements of the Flatpak portals.
