After reviewing the provided code, here are my observations regarding security defects:

1. **Use of `static_cast` for Downcasting (Hypothetical)**:
   - In the refactoring context, if `static_cast` is used to replace `dynamic_cast`, it can lead to undefined behavior if the cast is invalid. This is not directly evident in the provided code but is a potential issue in the refactoring process.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that downcasting is always safe by performing type checks before using `static_cast`. Alternatively, continue using `dynamic_cast` where type safety cannot be guaranteed, as it safely returns `nullptr` on failure.

2. **Dereferencing Point
