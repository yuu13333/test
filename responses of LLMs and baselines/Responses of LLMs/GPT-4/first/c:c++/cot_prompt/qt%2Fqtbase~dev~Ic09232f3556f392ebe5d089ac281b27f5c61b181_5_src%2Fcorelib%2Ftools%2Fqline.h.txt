After reviewing the provided code, which primarily consists of class definitions for `QLine` and `QLineF` in the Qt framework, I find no obvious security defects. The code largely deals with geometric calculations and object properties without involving direct user input, network communication, or file operations, which are common areas for security vulnerabilities.

The methods and operations performed in the code are deterministic and internal to the objects, and there's no evident use of external or untrusted data. The use of `constexpr` and inline functions suggests a focus on compile-time evaluation and optimization, which doesn't typically introduce security risks.

In the context of C++ and Qt development, common security concerns might include buffer overflows, memory leaks, or improper handling of user input. However, these concerns are not applicable to the code provided, as it doesn't involve dynamic memory allocation, buffer operations, or direct user input processing.

Therefore, based on the provided code segment:

**No security defects are detected in the code.**

It's important to note that this analysis is based on the provided code snippet alone. A comprehensive security assessment would require a broader view of the entire application or library, including how these classes interact with other components, how they handle data, and the overall architecture of the system.
