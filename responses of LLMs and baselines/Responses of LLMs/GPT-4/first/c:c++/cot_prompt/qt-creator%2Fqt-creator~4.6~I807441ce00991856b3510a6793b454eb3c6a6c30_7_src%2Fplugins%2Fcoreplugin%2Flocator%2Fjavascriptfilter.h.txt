Upon examining the provided code and the supplemented context:

No security defects are detected in the code.

However, I would like to add a few general security considerations:

1. **JavaScript Evaluation**: When using `QJSEngine` to evaluate arbitrary JavaScript code, there's a risk of executing unintended or malicious scripts. While `QJSEngine` is sandboxed (unlike `eval()` in a browser), a malicious actor could potentially exploit the engine in unknown ways or cause denial of service by executing long-running scripts.

2. **Input Validation**: Always be careful when evaluating user input. Ensure proper input validation and restrict the kind of scripts or commands that can be executed. For example, if the intended use is for simple calculations, validate that the input only contains mathematical operations and numbers.

3. **Resource Leaks**: Always make sure to properly manage resources. If there are too many requests to evaluate scripts, the `QJSEngine` might consume a lot of memory or CPU, leading to performance issues or potential denial of service.

In the given context, the primary consideration would be the JavaScript evaluation. Ensure that you're aware of the potential risks and are taking appropriate precautions.
