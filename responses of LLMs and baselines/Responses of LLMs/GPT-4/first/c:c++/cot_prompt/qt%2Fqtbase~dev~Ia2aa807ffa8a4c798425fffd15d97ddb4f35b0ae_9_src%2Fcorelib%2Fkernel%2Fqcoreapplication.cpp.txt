To analyze the original code for potential security defects, I'll need you to provide the code in question. Please paste the code here, and I will review it for any security issues, including vulnerabilities or bad practices that could lead to security risks. If there are any issues, I'll describe them in detail, including the line numbers and suggested solutions. If no issues are found, I'll confirm that as well.
