### Supplementary Code for `mul_overflow` Implementation for MSVC arm64

#### File: `qnumeric_msvc_arm64.cpp`

```cpp
#include "qnumeric_p.h"

#if defined(Q_CC_MSVC) && defined(Q_PROCESSOR_ARM_64)

#include <arm64intr.h> // Include ARM64 specific intrinsics

QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE

// Implementation of mul_overflow for MSVC arm64
// This uses ARM64 specific intrinsics to efficiently
// perform multiplication and check for overflow.

namespace {
    template <>
    inline bool mul_overflow(quint64 v1, quint64 v2, quint64 *r) {
        // Use ARM64 intrinsic for 64-bit unsigned multiplication.
        // The intrinsic returns the higher 64 bits of the 128-bit result,
        // which we can use to detect overflow.
        quint64 high;
        *r = _umul128(v1, v2, &high);
        return high != 0;
    }

    template <>
    inline bool mul_overflow(qint64 v1, qint64 v2, qint64 *r) {
        // Similar to the unsigned case, but for signed integers.
        qint64 high;
        *r = _mul128(v1, v2, &high);
        // Overflow occurs if the sign of high is different from the sign of r,
        // or if high is not equal to the extension of the sign bit of r.
        return high != (*r >> 63);
    }
}

#### Notes:

1. **Intrinsics**: The code assumes the existence of `_umul128` and `_mul128` intrinsics for ARM64 in MSVC, which are hypothetical in this context. The actual intrinsics might differ.

2. **Overflow Detection**: The method for detecting overflow depends on the specifics of how multiplication is handled in ARM64 architecture and the available intrinsics.

3. **Platform-Specific File**: This implementation would typically be part of a platform-specific source file within the Qt framework, separate from the main `qnumeric_p.h` file.

4. **Testing and Validation**: Extensive testing is required to ensure that this implementation works correctly under all edge cases, especially for boundary values where overflow is likely to occur.

5. **Integration with Qt**: This code would need to be integrated into the Qt build system, ensuring it is only compiled for the appropriate MSVC arm64 target.

This implementation provides a starting point, but actual development would require in-depth knowledge of MSVC's ARM64 intrinsics and rigorous testing within the Qt framework's existing structure.
