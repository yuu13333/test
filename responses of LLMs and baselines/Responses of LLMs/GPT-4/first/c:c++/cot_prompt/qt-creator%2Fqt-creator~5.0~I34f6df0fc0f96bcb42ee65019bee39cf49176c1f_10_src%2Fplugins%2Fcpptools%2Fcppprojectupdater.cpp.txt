Let's analyze the provided code for potential security defects:

1. **Memory and Resource Management**: One common source of vulnerabilities is poor memory and resource management.
    - **Memory Leaks**: Not properly releasing allocated memory can cause memory leaks, which can be leveraged in denial-of-service attacks or information disclosures.
    - **Dangling Pointers**: Accessing memory or resources after they've been released can lead to undefined behavior.

2. **Data Validation**: Data that isn't properly validated can lead to injection attacks, buffer overflows, and other vulnerabilities.
  
3. **Concurrency**: Issues related to concurrent access, especially in multithreaded environments, can lead to race conditions and other unpredictable behaviors.

4. **Trust Boundaries**: Trusting external inputs or not properly isolating components can introduce vulnerabilities.

Let's examine the code with these categories in mind:

1. **Memory and Resource Management**: 
    - In the `update` function, there is the use of `QPointer<ExtraCompiler>` (lines 72-74). This is essentially a weak reference, and if the `ExtraCompiler` object gets deleted elsewhere in the code, this could lead to a dangling pointer. However, the use of `QPointer` mitigates this as it will automatically be set to `nullptr` if the object it points to is destroyed. 
    - In the `cancel` function (lines 125-134), there's the call `qDeleteAll(m_extraCompilersFutureWatchers);`. If another function accesses `m_extraCompilersFutureWatchers` after they've been deleted, it could result in undefined behavior. However, it seems the list is cleared right after deletion, which reduces the risk.

2. **Data Validation**: 
    - The code does not seem to directly handle untrusted input or perform explicit data validation, so there aren't any apparent vulnerabilities in this category.

3. **Concurrency**:
    - The code uses `QFuture` and `QFutureWatcher` to handle asynchronous tasks. The potential issue lies with race conditions. For instance, in `checkForExtraCompilersFinished` (lines 158-180), there's a check if `m_extraCompilersFutureWatchers` is empty or if the `m_generateFutureWatcher` is still running. If another thread modifies `m_extraCompilersFutureWatchers` between the check and the subsequent operations, this could lead to unexpected behavior.

4. **Trust Boundaries**:
    - The code does not seem to trust external data or inputs directly, so there aren't any evident vulnerabilities related to trust boundaries.

Based on the above analysis:

```No security defects are detected in the code```.

However, it's essential to note that this is a code snippet. The full context (e.g., how these functions are called, the rest of the software, the environment in which this runs) could potentially expose vulnerabilities not evident from this snippet alone.
