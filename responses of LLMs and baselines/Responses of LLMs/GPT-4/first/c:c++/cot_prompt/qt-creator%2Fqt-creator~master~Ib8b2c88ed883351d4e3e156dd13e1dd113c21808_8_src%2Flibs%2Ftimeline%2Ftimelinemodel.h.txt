Upon careful examination of the provided code, here are the potential security concerns:

1. **Potential SQL/NoSQL Injection**: 
   - In a cloud-based system or any backend system, when accepting parameters from user input or HTTP request, there's always a potential for SQL/NoSQL injection if those inputs are not properly sanitized before being passed to the database. 
   - In the code at line `160`, `resources = util.normalize_resources_qs_param(req.GET['resources'])` the code is fetching the `resources` parameter from the HTTP GET request, and we don't know the internals of the `util.normalize_resources_qs_param` function. If this function doesn't sanitize the input properly and if this input is passed to a database query without being validated or parameterized, it could be a potential point for injection attacks.
   
     **Solution**: Ensure that the `util.normalize_resources_qs_param` function properly sanitizes and validates the input. Use parameterized queries or ORM methods when passing this data to the database.

2. **Improper Error Handling**:
   - At lines `156-158` and `170-172`, the code raises an error with a message that includes the exception message. If the exception message contains sensitive details or internal workings of the system, this can expose important information to an attacker.
   
     **Solution**: Rather than directly using system-generated exception messages, it's better to log the system-generated exception for internal debugging and show a generic error message to the user.

3. **Content-Type not set before setting the response body**:
   - At lines `176-178`, the response body is set before the content type. While this may not be a direct security issue, it's a best practice to set the `content_type` of the response before setting the body to ensure the client interprets the response correctly.
   
     **Solution**: Swap the lines to set the content type before setting the body.

Other general points to consider:
- **Input Validation**: It's important to ensure that all inputs coming from the user or external systems are validated properly before processing. Even if they are validated using `jsonschema` in this code, they should also be checked for any unexpected or malicious values.
- **Logging**: The code imports a logging module, but it's not used extensively. Proper logging can help detect and investigate suspicious activities.

**Conclusion**:
These are potential security concerns based on the provided context. However, the actual risk and mitigation strategies might vary depending on the entire system, deployment environment, and other factors not visible in this snippet. Regular security audits by professionals with a full view of the system are highly recommended.

As of this snippet: '''No critical security defects are directly detected in the code, but there are areas of potential concern.'''
