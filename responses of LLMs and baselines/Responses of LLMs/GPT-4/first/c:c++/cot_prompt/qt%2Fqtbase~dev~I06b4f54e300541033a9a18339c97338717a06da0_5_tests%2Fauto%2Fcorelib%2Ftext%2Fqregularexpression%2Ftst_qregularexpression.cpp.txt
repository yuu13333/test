After analyzing the provided code, there are no apparent security defects detected. The code mainly deals with regular expressions and their matching logic in the Qt framework, and it seems to follow good coding practices for memory management and input handling. The addition of move constructors and null pointer checks, as mentioned in the commit message, actually enhances the robustness and safety of the code.

Therefore, I can state: '''No security defects are detected in the code'''.
