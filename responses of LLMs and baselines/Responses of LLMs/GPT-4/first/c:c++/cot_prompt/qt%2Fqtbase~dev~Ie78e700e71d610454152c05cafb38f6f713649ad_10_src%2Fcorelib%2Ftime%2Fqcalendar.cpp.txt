To analyze the original code and the proposed supplementary files for security defects, I'll focus on common security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, memory leaks, improper handling of user input, race conditions, and improper use of pointers or references. Let's examine the provided code:

1. **Use of Mutex and Atomic Operations**: The original code uses a mutex (`QBasicMutex registryMutex`) and atomic operations (`QAtomicPointer` and `QAtomicInteger`) to manage concurrent access to the `Registry` structure. This is a good practice for thread safety and helps prevent race conditions. 

2. **Memory Management**: The code uses `new` for memory allocation (e.g., `backend = new QGregorianCalendar;`) and `delete` for de-allocation. This is standard in C++, but it requires careful management to avoid memory leaks. The use of smart pointers could be recommended to automate memory management and prevent memory leaks.

3. **Input Validation**: The code includes checks like `Q_ASSERT(!name.isEmpty())` and other conditions to validate inputs. This is crucial to prevent issues like null pointer dereferences or unintended behavior.

4. **Exception Handling**: C++ can throw exceptions, but there are no explicit try-catch blocks in the provided code. Proper exception handling is essential, especially in a library, to ensure that exceptions are caught and handled appropriately.

5. **String Handling**: The use of `QString` for string operations is safe in terms of buffer overflows, unlike C-style strings.

6. **Thread Safety**: The code uses scoped locks (e.g., `qt_scoped_lock(registryMutex)`) to ensure that concurrent access to shared resources is managed correctly. This is important to prevent race conditions.

7. **Use of Assertions**: Assertions (`Q_ASSERT`) are used for internal state checking. While they are helpful for debugging, they are usually removed in release builds. Therefore, critical error checks should not rely solely on assertions.

8. **Destruction of Objects**: The destructor of `Registry` (`~Registry()`) carefully de-allocates resources, which is good practice for preventing memory leaks.

9. **Custom Backend Registration**: The instructions in the supplementary documentation file (`qcalendar-doc.txt`) emphasize the importance of thread safety and unique naming during backend registration. This is important to avoid conflicts and potential security issues.

Based on this analysis, I find that:

**No security defects are detected in the code.**

However, it's worth noting that a detailed security review by a specialist in C++ and Qt framework, especially considering the context in which this library is used, would be more conclusive. This analysis is based on the provided code snippets and standard security practices.
