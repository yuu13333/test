To create supplementary code files based on the commit message and the provided code, it's essential to understand the changes mentioned in the commit message and how they relate to the existing code. The commit message states:

- **Redefine QRect internals to avoid one-off logic**: This indicates a change in the internal representation of the `QRect` class.
- **Changes in the definition of x2, y2**: The coordinates x2 and y2 are being redefined to be the first coordinates after the last inside point.
- **Simplification of logic and bug fixes**: The changes aim to simplify existing logic and fix specific bugs.

Given the extensive nature of the existing `QRect` class code, the supplementary files would likely involve updating the implementation of various member functions to align with the new definition of x2 and y2. This could include changes to methods like `setRight()`, `setBottom()`, `width()`, `height()`, and any other method that relies on the x2 and y2 values.

Since writing the entire supplementary code is extensive and requires careful consideration of each method, I'll outline potential changes for a few key methods:

1. **setRight(int pos) and setBottom(int pos)**: These methods would need to be updated to reflect the new definition of x2 and y2. Instead of simply adding 1 to pos for x2 and y2, the logic might need to be revised based on the new definition.

2. **width() and height()**: The calculation of width and height might change slightly to adapt to the new definition of the rectangle's edges.

3. **contains() and intersects()**: These methods may need adjustments to work with the modified internal representation.

4. **Adjustments in Constructors**: Constructors initializing x2 and y2 might require modifications to ensure that the rectangle is defined correctly according to the new rules.

5. **Tests and Examples**: Supplementary files could also include updated tests to ensure that the new changes don't break existing functionality and to test the bug fixes mentioned in the commit message.

6. **Documentation**: Comments and documentation within the code would need to be updated to reflect the new logic and any changes in the API.

Creating the actual code for these changes requires a deep understanding of the existing logic and the specific requirements of the new implementation. It's a process that involves careful consideration of each function and its interaction with the rest of the class.
