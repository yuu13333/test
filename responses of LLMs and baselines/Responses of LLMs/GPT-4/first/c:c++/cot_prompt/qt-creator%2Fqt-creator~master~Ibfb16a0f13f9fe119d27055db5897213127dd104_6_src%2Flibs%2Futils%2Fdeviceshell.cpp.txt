Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a potential security defect:

### Security Defect

**Defect:** Command Injection

**Description:** 
The method `runInShellImpl` takes an input `cmd` and constructs a shell command that gets executed via `m_shellProcess->write(command)`. If `cmd` contains malicious input, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands.

**Affected Line:** 
```cpp
const QString command = prefix + cmd.toUserOutput() + suffix;
```
(Line 100)

**Solution:** 
It is critical to validate and sanitize the `cmd` input to ensure that it does not contain malicious strings that could be executed as shell commands. One common method is to use whitelists of allowed commands or use regular expressions to validate command patterns. It's also crucial to avoid constructing shell commands via string concatenation with unsanitized user input.

Additionally, the code uses `stdInData` to construct a shell command and encodes it in base64. It's crucial to validate this data as well.

### Conclusion
While the primary concern is the command injection, other parts of the code might have security implications depending on the broader context in which they are used. Regular security reviews and thorough testing (including penetration testing) are recommended for such utilities.

Please note that a deep and comprehensive code review would require knowledge of all dependent functions, libraries, and how this class is intended to be used. The above information is based on the provided code context.
