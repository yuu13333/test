Let's examine the provided `QTemporaryDir` class code for potential security defects:

1. Raw Pointer: The code is using a raw pointer (`d_ptr`) to manage the internal data. 
    - **Security Issue**: Raw pointers, if mismanaged, can lead to memory leaks or unintended memory access. While not inherently a security flaw, it can be a vector for denial of service if an attacker can exploit the memory leak. Furthermore, improper management of memory might lead to undefined behavior which can potentially be exploited.
    - **Lines**: `81`
    - **Solution**: Consider using smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` or revert to `QScopedPointer` if its non-movability can be addressed in another manner. If sticking with raw pointers, ensure all member functions handle the memory correctly, and the destructor releases memory. 

2. Move Semantics: The move constructor and move assignment operator are implemented for the class. 
    - **Security Issue**: If not correctly implemented, moving an object can lead to multiple objects pointing to the same memory, which can be deleted multiple times (double delete) leading to undefined behavior.
    - **Lines**: `58-66`
    - **Solution**: Ensure that the moved-from object does not delete or access the shared memory after the move. The current implementation appears correct as it nulls out the pointer of the moved-from object. However, care must be taken in the destructor to handle the case when `d_ptr` is `nullptr`.

3. Disabled Copy Semantics: The copy constructor and copy assignment operator are explicitly disabled. 
    - **Security Issue**: None. Disabling copying is a good practice when move semantics are implemented to prevent shallow copying of internal resources.
    - **Lines**: `83`
    - **Solution**: No action needed. It's a correct practice for this scenario.

Based on the provided code, the main concerns are related to the use and management of raw pointers. The code doesn't seem to have explicit security defects, but it's worth noting that without the implementation details of the destructor and any other potential member functions that manage the `d_ptr`, there's potential for memory mismanagement issues. 

However, since this is a header file and the actual implementations of the methods are not provided, we can't definitively conclude on all security aspects. Proper examination requires the source file (`*.cpp`) to determine how the class handles memory and other operations.
