Upon analyzing the code, I've identified a potential security defect:

#### Defect:
The use of lambda functions capturing variables by value can lead to stale or unexpected data. In this case, the lambda function captures `projectUpdateInfo` by value. If the external state or the value of `projectUpdateInfo` changes after the lambda is defined but before it is executed, the lambda will still operate on the old copy of the data.

##### Line Number: 
66

##### Description:
The line:
```cpp
m_generateFuture = Utils::runAsync([=](QFutureInterface<ProjectInfo> &futureInterface) {
```
captures `projectUpdateInfo` by value. If there's any possibility that this variable changes in the future, the lambda might work on outdated or unexpected data.

##### Solution:
One way to avoid this issue is to be explicit about what you're capturing and, when necessary, use references (e.g., `[&projectUpdateInfo]`) if the most up-to-date data is needed. However, you must also ensure that the variable's lifespan outlasts the lambda's execution to prevent dangling references. Another solution is to ensure that the logic inside the lambda function and the external state are synchronized properly to avoid any unexpected behavior.

Other than the above, I don't see any glaring security vulnerabilities. Remember that the full security posture of a piece of software depends on its entire ecosystem, including the libraries it uses, the platforms it runs on, and how it's used in practice. This review only considered the given code in isolation.
