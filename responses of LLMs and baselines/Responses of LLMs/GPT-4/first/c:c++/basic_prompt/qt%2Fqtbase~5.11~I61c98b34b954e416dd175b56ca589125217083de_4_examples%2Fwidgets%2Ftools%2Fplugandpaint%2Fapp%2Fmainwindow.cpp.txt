After reviewing the code, a security defect is detected:

### Security Defect:

#### Arbitrary Code Execution via Plugin Loading:
The code allows dynamic loading of plugins from a directory derived from the application's path (`pluginsDir`). There's no verification or validation of the authenticity or integrity of these plugins, which means that an attacker could potentially drop a malicious plugin into the expected directory, and when the application runs, it could load and execute malicious code.

1. Vulnerable Lines:
   - **266**: Plugins are loaded from the `pluginsDir`.
   - **268-274**: Plugin files from the directory are dynamically loaded without any checks.

#### Solution:

1. Implement signature verification: Only allow plugins that have been signed by a trusted entity. Before loading a plugin, verify its signature to ensure that it has not been tampered with and that it originates from a trusted source.
   
2. Whitelist allowed plugins: Instead of loading all plugins in a directory, maintain a whitelist of allowed plugins, and only load those. This way, even if a malicious actor places a plugin in the directory, it won't be loaded unless it's in the whitelist.

3. Restrict write permissions: Ensure that the plugins directory is secured against unauthorized write operations. This can reduce the risk of an attacker being able to drop a malicious plugin into the directory.

By implementing the above-mentioned solutions, the risk of arbitrary code execution via malicious plugins can be reduced significantly.
