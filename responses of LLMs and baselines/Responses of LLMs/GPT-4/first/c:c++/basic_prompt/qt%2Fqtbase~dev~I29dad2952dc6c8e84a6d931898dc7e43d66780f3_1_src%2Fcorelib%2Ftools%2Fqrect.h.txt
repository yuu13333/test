After reviewing the provided code, which is part of the QtCore module of the Qt Toolkit, no security defects are detected. The code primarily defines the `QRect` and `QRectF` classes, which represent rectangular areas in 2D space, with methods for manipulating these areas (like checking if they are empty, moving them, adjusting their size, etc.).

The code follows good programming practices for a C++ header file in the context of a library like Qt. It includes necessary guards against multiple inclusions (`#ifndef QRECT_H`...`#endif`), uses `noexcept` specifications where exceptions are not expected, and clearly defines the public API for the classes.

It's important to note that the absence of security defects in this review is based on the information provided and the context of the code as a Qt module. Security analysis can be highly context-dependent, and a deeper review might be necessary for specific use cases or if more complex interactions with other parts of a system are involved.
