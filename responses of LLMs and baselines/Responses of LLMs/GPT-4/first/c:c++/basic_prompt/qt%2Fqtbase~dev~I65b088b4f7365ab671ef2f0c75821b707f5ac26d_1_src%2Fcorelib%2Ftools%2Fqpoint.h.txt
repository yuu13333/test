After reviewing the provided code, which is part of the Qt framework and defines the `QPoint` and `QPointF` classes, no security defects are detected. The code primarily involves the implementation of point manipulation in a 2D space with basic arithmetic and comparison operations. Key observations include:

1. **Use of `constexpr` and `noexcept`:** The code heavily uses these C++11 features to ensure compile-time computation and exception safety, which is a good practice for efficiency and reliability.

2. **Data Encapsulation:** The `xp` and `yp` members of the classes are private, ensuring data encapsulation and preventing unauthorized access from outside the class.

3. **Type Safety:** The methods and operators are correctly typed and do not perform unsafe casts or operations that could lead to undefined behavior.

4. **Assertion Checks:** In `QPointF::operator/=(qreal divisor)`, the code uses `Q_ASSERT` to ensure the divisor is not zero before performing division, which is a good practice to avoid divide-by-zero errors.

5. **Consistent Use of Safe Functions:** Functions like `qRound`, `qAbs`, and `qFuzzyCompare` are used for rounding, absolute value calculation, and floating-point comparison, respectively. These functions are standard in the Qt framework and are designed to handle edge cases safely.

6. **Proper Handling of External Structures:** In cases where the code interfaces with platform-specific structures (like `CGPoint` on Darwin systems), it uses conditional compilation to ensure platform compatibility.

7. **No Indications of Memory Mismanagement:** The code does not involve direct memory management, dynamic allocation, or pointers, which reduces the risk of memory leaks or buffer overflows.

8. **Lack of Network or File I/O Operations:** Since the code doesn't perform any network communication or file I/O operations, it is less susceptible to common security issues like remote code execution or file corruption.

The overall structure and implementation of the code suggest that it adheres to good coding practices and does not exhibit apparent security defects. However, it's important to note that a complete security audit would involve more thorough testing, including checking how this code interacts with other parts of the system.
