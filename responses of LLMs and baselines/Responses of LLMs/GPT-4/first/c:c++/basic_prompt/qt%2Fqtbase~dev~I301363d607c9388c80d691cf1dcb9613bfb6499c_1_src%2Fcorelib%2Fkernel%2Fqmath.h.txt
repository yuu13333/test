No security defects are detected in the code.

However, while the code appears to be generally safe, there are a few best practices and considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Templates**: Template functions are inherently type-agnostic, but you need to make sure that the operations within them make sense for the types that might be passed to them. For instance, if an unsupported type is passed to the template functions, you might get compile-time errors.

2. **Overflow and Underflow**: For mathematical operations, always consider potential overflow or underflow. This is more of a correctness and robustness issue rather than a security issue. But in certain contexts, especially if the results are used for memory allocations or array indexing, it could become a security concern.

3. **Precision**: The `qFastSin` and `qFastCos` functions provide faster calculations using a lookup table but may not be as precise as the standard `sin` and `cos` functions. Ensure that the level of precision is appropriate for your application.

4. **Includes and Macros**: Be careful with preprocessor directives that include headers and define macros. These could have side effects depending on the environment in which the code is compiled. The `_USE_MATH_DEFINES` and its related logic are an example. However, the code seems to handle the potential side effects well.

5. **External Dependencies**: `qt_sine_table` is declared as an external array. The safety of accessing this array would depend on its actual definition and initialization elsewhere in the codebase. Always ensure proper bounds checking when accessing arrays.

6. **Type Conversions**: The code often converts between types (e.g., from a templated type `T` to `int`). Ensure that these conversions don't inadvertently truncate or lose data, especially in the context of your application.

7. **Future Development**: The code has placeholders for future updates, such as C++14 features. If and when these features are added, ensure they're reviewed for security as well.

Always ensure that you have unit tests covering various edge cases and potential pitfalls related to the operations in this code, and consider using sanitizers or other analysis tools to detect potential runtime issues.
