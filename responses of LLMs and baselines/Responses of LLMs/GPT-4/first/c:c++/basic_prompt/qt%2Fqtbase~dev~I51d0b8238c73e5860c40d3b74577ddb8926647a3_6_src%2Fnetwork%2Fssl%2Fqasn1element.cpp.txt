Let's review the provided code for potential security defects:

1. **Unbounded Read of Memory (Buffer Overread)**
   
   In function `QAsn1Element::read`, the code is attempting to read the ASN.1 format data. The ASN.1 format can have both short-form and long-form lengths. In the case of the long form, the number of octets that encode the length can be from 1 to 127. While this is a wide range, there is a check in place (`if (bytes > 7) return false;` in line 108) that limits the number of bytes that can be read to be no more than 7. Thus, the implementation does take a precaution against extremely large sizes.

   However, a problem occurs at this part:

   ```cpp
   QByteArray tmpValue;
   int remainingLength = length;
   while (remainingLength) {
       char readBuffer[BUFFERSIZE];
       const int bytesToRead = qMin(remainingLength, BUFFERSIZE);
       const int count = stream.readRawData(readBuffer, bytesToRead);
       if (count != int(bytesToRead))
           return false;
       tmpValue.append(readBuffer, bytesToRead);
       remainingLength -= bytesToRead;
   }
   ```

   When the code reads the data into the `readBuffer` (lines 129-136), there isn't a direct check ensuring that `remainingLength` is indeed the correct length of the data in the stream. If the data stream has less than the expected data, then `stream.readRawData(readBuffer, bytesToRead)` will not read the expected number of bytes, potentially causing buffer over-read when the `tmpValue.append(readBuffer, bytesToRead);` call is made.

2. **Arbitrary Memory Allocation**

   Line 121 checks if the calculated length exceeds the limit of a signed integer (`std::numeric_limits<int>::max()`) and returns false if it does. This check is a good step toward mitigating potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that could arise from attempting to allocate extremely large memory sizes. However, for applications running on systems with limited memory, even values well below this threshold can cause resource exhaustion. A stricter check might be desirable, depending on the deployment context of the software.

3. **Complex Parsing Logic for ASN.1 Data**

   ASN.1 data is notoriously tricky to parse securely because of its encoding rules. The code tries to handle this complexity, but ASN.1 parsing is a common area for vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use well-reviewed libraries specifically designed for this purpose rather than writing custom parsers.

4. **No Bounds Check on Data Stream Reads**

   For functions like `read`, there's an assumption that the data stream will contain the amount of data specified by the ASN.1 length field. This assumption can lead to potential issues if the data stream doesn't contain the amount of data expected, leading to potential buffer over-read issues or incorrect data parsing.

Recommendations:

1. It's recommended to add checks ensuring the integrity and consistency of the data read from the stream. This can help avoid situations where the `readRawData` function doesn't fill the expected number of bytes in the buffer.
2. Instead of implementing custom ASN.1 parsers, consider using well-established and community-reviewed libraries for such purposes.
3. Always validate and sanitize input data, especially when it's coming from external, untrusted sources.

However, it's essential to note that without the complete context of how this code is used and without seeing the full codebase, there may be other vulnerabilities not immediately apparent from the provided snippet.
