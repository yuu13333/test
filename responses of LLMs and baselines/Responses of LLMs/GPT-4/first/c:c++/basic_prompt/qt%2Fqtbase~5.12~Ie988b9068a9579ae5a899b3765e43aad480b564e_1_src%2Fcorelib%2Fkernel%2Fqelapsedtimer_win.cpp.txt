Upon reviewing the code, I've identified the following potential security-related concerns:

1. **Static State with Multi-threading (Potential Race Condition)**
   
   The function `resolveCounterFrequency()` uses a static variable `done` to ensure that `QueryPerformanceFrequency` is called only once. If multiple threads call this function simultaneously, there's a potential race condition where `QueryPerformanceFrequency` might be called multiple times.
   
   *Lines:* 52-66
   
   *Solution:* To address this, you can use atomic operations or mutexes to ensure that `resolveCounterFrequency` is thread-safe. If you're using C++11 or later, you might want to make use of `std::call_once`.

2. **Asserts in Production Code**

   The code uses `Q_ASSERT_X` to check if `QueryPerformanceCounter` succeeded or not, but asserts are usually no-ops in release builds.

   *Lines:* 98-100
   
   *Solution:* Instead of relying on assertions which can be removed in production code, you should handle the error gracefully. If the query fails, you can fallback to a safer or less accurate timer, or raise an appropriate error.

3. **Potential Division by Zero**

   The functions `ticksToNanoseconds` and `nanosecondsToTicks` use `counterFrequency` for division. If `counterFrequency` is 0, you might get a division by zero error.
   
   *Lines:* 72, 84
   
   *Solution:* The code does seem to check for `counterFrequency > 0` before performing the division, but it's a good practice to ensure that there's no way `counterFrequency` can be zero when you reach those divisions.

4. **Use of `qFatal` for Fatal Errors**

   The function `resolveCounterFrequency()` uses `qFatal` if `QueryPerformanceFrequency` fails.
   
   *Lines:* 59
   
   *Solution:* Using `qFatal` will abruptly terminate the application. While it's clear that the developer believes this function shouldn't fail, it might be better to handle such scenarios more gracefully, especially if the failure is due to reasons beyond the control of the application.

No other obvious security defects are detected in the code. However, it's important to note that a code review is just one layer in a defense-in-depth strategy. Regular testing, vulnerability assessments, and adherence to best practices are essential to ensure the security of any codebase.
