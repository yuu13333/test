After reviewing the provided code, I found no security defects. The code seems to be a part of the Qt framework, specifically related to the `QDeadlineTimer` class, which is used for managing deadlines and timers. The functions are primarily dealing with time calculations and do not involve direct network or file operations, which are common areas for security vulnerabilities.

Key observations:

1. The code uses `qint64` for time calculations, which is a safe choice for handling large time values without overflow.
2. There is proper checking for overflow and underflow in time calculations (e.g., `add_overflow` function usage in lines 106, 129, 145, 155).
3. The use of `constexpr` and `static_assert` statements ensure compile-time validation of certain conditions, contributing to safer code.
4. The code is well-structured with error checks and returns appropriate boolean values indicating success or failure of operations.

In summary, no security defects are detected in the code.
