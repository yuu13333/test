After carefully reviewing the provided Qt Base code, focusing on the `QPoint` and `QPointF` classes, I found no apparent security defects. The code primarily consists of class definitions, constructors, accessors, mutators, and operator overloads for handling two-dimensional points. Here are some key observations:

1. **Use of `constexpr` and `noexcept`**: The heavy use of `constexpr` and `noexcept` suggests that the functions are intended to be used at compile time and do not throw exceptions. This is a good practice as it provides compile-time evaluation where possible and clarity on exception behavior.

2. **Data Encapsulation**: The private members `xp` and `yp` in both classes are well-encapsulated, and access to these members is controlled through public methods, which is a good object-oriented practice.

3. **Type Safety**: The code uses appropriate types for its operations. For instance, `int` is used for `QPoint` and `qreal` for `QPointF`, which is consistent with their intended usage.

4. **Mathematical Operations**: Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are implemented using operator overloading. These operations are straightforward and do not exhibit any signs of security issues like buffer overflows or integer overflows.

5. **Assertions**: The use of `Q_ASSERT` in `QPointF::operator/=(qreal divisor)` (line 415) is a good practice as it ensures that the divisor is not zero, which prevents divide-by-zero errors.

6. **Data Conversion and Stream Operations**: The functions for converting between `QPoint` and `QPointF`, and for stream operations, do not show any vulnerabilities. They are simple data transformations without any complex logic that might introduce security issues.

In conclusion, the examined code segment from Qt Base does not exhibit any obvious security defects. It is well-structured and follows good coding practices, which reduces the likelihood of common security vulnerabilities.
