After reviewing the provided Qt code, I found no security defects. The code appears to focus primarily on testing various aspects of `QFuture`, a Qt class for managing asynchronous operations. It includes various tests for features like result storage, state propagation, exception handling, signal connections, and more. Each test case seems well-defined and adheres to standard Qt practices for asynchronous operation handling and signal-slot mechanisms.

In summary, **no security defects are detected in the code**.
