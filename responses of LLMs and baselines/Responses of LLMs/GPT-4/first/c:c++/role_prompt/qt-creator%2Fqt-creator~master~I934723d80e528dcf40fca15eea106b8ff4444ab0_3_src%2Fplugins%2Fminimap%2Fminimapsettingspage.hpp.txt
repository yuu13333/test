No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code is a header file for a settings page related to a minimap feature in Qt Creator. The code defines data members and a couple of member functions for the settings page.

However, a few general notes:

1. **Memory Management**: The usage of `QScopedPointer<QWidget> m_widget;` ensures that the widget will be automatically deleted when the `MinimapSettingsPage` object is destroyed. This helps in preventing memory leaks.
2. **Data Encapsulation**: The private members ensure that the data is encapsulated and is only accessible within the class. There aren't public setters or getters that can modify these directly.
3. **Signals and Slots**: The function `void displaySettingsChanged(const TextEditor::DisplaySettings &settings);` seems to be a slot or callback that reacts to some changes. It would be beneficial to review its implementation in the corresponding `.cpp` file to ensure there are no security vulnerabilities in its logic.
4. **No Raw Pointers**: It's commendable that raw pointers (like those used for `QCheckBox` and `QSpinBox`) aren't being new'ed up directly in the header. Ensuring they are properly allocated and deallocated in the corresponding source file is crucial.

Remember, security is often context-dependent. Even though this header file doesn't present obvious security issues, the implementation in the source file might. Always ensure that the full context (i.e., both the header and source files, plus how they interact with other components) is reviewed when assessing security.
