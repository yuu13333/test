After reviewing the provided code, I've noted the following points:

1. The code uses the C++ namespace mechanism. The two nested namespaces, `Core` and `Internal`, help in organizing the code.

2. The code appears to be related to managing and controlling windows within a larger application, possibly the Qt Creator.

3. The use of static class members such as `QMenu *WindowList::m_dockMenu = 0;` is a common pattern in C++ for shared resources among instances. 

4. I don't see any direct memory allocations (`new`) without a corresponding deallocation (`delete`) in the destructor or another appropriate location. This is a good sign since memory leaks can be a common source of problems.

5. There are no direct I/O operations, database queries, or network requests, which are common sources of security defects.

6. The lambda functions used within the code are brief and do not capture more than required.

7. The use of `QTC_ASSERT` throughout the code is a good sign. Assertions can help catch unexpected conditions at runtime, which can be useful for identifying and debugging potential issues.

8. The code interacts with actions and windows but doesn't appear to be processing untrusted input directly.

With the points mentioned above in consideration:

**Result**: No security defects are detected in the code.

That being said, security analysis can be a deep field, and this review is based on the provided code snippet. If the application processes untrusted input in other parts, or if other libraries it uses have vulnerabilities, there could still be security risks. It is always advisable to conduct periodic, in-depth security audits and keep software dependencies updated.
