Upon reviewing the provided code, I've identified a potential security concern:

#### Security Defect:
- **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**: 
  - **Line number**: 96
  - **Description**: The code constructs a `QByteArray` datagram by concatenating a fixed string with a dynamically increasing number (`messageNo`). Although this specific code seems innocuous as it's an example, in a real-world application, there's no check for the maximum value of `messageNo`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `messageNo` keeps increasing beyond the expected or allocated space.
  - **Solution**: It's important to validate or limit the range of `messageNo` to ensure that the resulting `datagram` remains within expected size bounds.

#### Recommended change:
Before incrementing `messageNo`, add a check to reset or limit its value:

```cpp
if (messageNo > MAX_LIMIT) {  // Choose a suitable MAX_LIMIT
    messageNo = 0;  // or another suitable starting value
}
++messageNo;
```

It's important to note that even with this change, sending broadcast messages without authentication or encryption can be exploited by malicious actors to spoof messages or conduct denial-of-service attacks. Always ensure network communications have the necessary security checks, especially in production applications.
