The provided code is from Qt Creator, specifically for updating a C++ project. Let's review it for potential security defects.

1. The code uses asynchronous operations, which can be prone to race conditions or deadlocks if not handled properly. The use of `QFutureWatcher` and `QFutureInterface` from the Qt library usually helps manage async tasks effectively, but it's crucial to ensure that you handle all related callbacks and cancellation correctly.

2. The `update` method (lines 53-74) schedules a background task to generate project info. This method uses a lambda (lines 66-72) that captures the `projectUpdateInfo` by value, which is a good practice to prevent accessing potentially deleted or modified objects. 

3. In the `cancel` method (lines 76-81), any ongoing asynchronous tasks are cancelled. It's important to ensure that these tasks are genuinely terminated and that no race conditions can arise.

4. The `cancelAndWaitForFinished` method (lines 83-90) cancels ongoing tasks and then waits for them to finish. This method can potentially block the calling thread if the tasks don't finish quickly. However, this behavior might be desired in some situations, like a destructor.

5. The `onToolChainRemoved` method (lines 92-97) listens for the removal of a toolchain. If the toolchain being removed matches the toolchains stored in `m_projectUpdateInfo`, then ongoing updates are canceled. This is a precautionary step to ensure no operations continue on a removed or potentially invalid toolchain.

Upon reviewing the provided code:
- I did not find explicit security defects like buffer overflows, SQL injections, or use-after-frees.
- The use of Qt's mechanisms for async operations and connections is consistent with good practices, though there's always a need to be cautious about race conditions when dealing with async operations.

However, it's worth noting:
- This is a relatively small part of the Qt Creator codebase. A comprehensive security review would require examining the entire project, especially the parts dealing with external input or potentially malicious files.
- Depending on the external methods or classes that interact with this class, there might be vulnerabilities or misuses outside of the provided code.

Given the above analysis:  
'''No security defects are detected in the code'''.
