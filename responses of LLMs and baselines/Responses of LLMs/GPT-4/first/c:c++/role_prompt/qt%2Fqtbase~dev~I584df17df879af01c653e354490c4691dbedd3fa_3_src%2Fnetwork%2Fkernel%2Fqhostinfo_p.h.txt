Based on the provided code:

No security defects are detected in the code.

However, a few points to consider:

1. **Memory Management**: While it's hard to ascertain from this snippet alone, proper management of allocated memory is crucial. If there are places elsewhere in the codebase where instances of these classes are being dynamically allocated (using `new`), then ensuring they are properly deleted will prevent memory leaks. This is especially important in classes that hold pointers to other objects.

2. **Concurrency**: The code appears to be multithreaded, using `QThreadPool` for concurrent execution. Ensuring that all multithreaded operations, especially those that might share or modify state, are thread-safe is essential. This involves making sure all shared resources (like `QCache`, `QMutex`, etc.) are accessed in a thread-safe manner.

3. **Error Handling**: The provided code doesn't seem to handle possible errors in depth (e.g., what happens if the DNS lookup fails? Is this handled elsewhere?). Robust error handling is an integral part of secure coding.

4. **Use of `private` classes and methods**: The usage of `private` headers and methods indicates that these aren't meant to be directly accessed outside of the Qt library. While not a security issue per se, it's important for developers using Qt to avoid relying on these, as they might change without notice.

5. **Potential DOS attacks**: If this service is exposed externally without any rate limiting, an attacker might be able to DOS it by making rapid and repeated calls.

While the code does not seem to have overt security vulnerabilities, it's essential to approach this review with the understanding that a single file's context does not provide a full picture of the entire system's security. Full application security reviews consider the application as a whole, its deployment environment, data flows, and more.
