After reviewing the provided Qt Base code, I did not detect any explicit security defects. The code primarily involves time manipulation and deadline checking, which generally don't raise direct security concerns unless they are part of a larger context where time calculations could lead to security-sensitive operations.

Here are some key observations:

1. **Overflow Protection**: The code employs overflow checks (e.g., `add_overflow` and `mul_overflow`), which is a good practice to avoid integer overflows that could potentially be exploited.

2. **Type Safety and Encapsulation**: The use of member functions and type-safe operations reduces the risk of memory corruption or type confusion vulnerabilities.

3. **No External Inputs**: The code does not seem to process or handle any external input directly, which is a common source of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or injection attacks.

4. **Error Handling**: The functions appear to handle error conditions gracefully, such as deadlines in the past, which indicates good programming practice.

However, it's important to note that this review is based on a standalone examination of the provided snippet. Security defects often depend on the broader context in which the code is used, including how it interacts with other components, how it handles user input, and the specific environment in which it's deployed. 

Moreover, a thorough security review usually involves more than just a static analysis of the code. It should also include dynamic analysis, testing (including fuzz testing), and consideration of the specific use case and deployment environment. If this code is part of a larger system, especially one that handles sensitive data or has significant security requirements, I would recommend a more comprehensive security audit conducted by professionals specialized in software security.
