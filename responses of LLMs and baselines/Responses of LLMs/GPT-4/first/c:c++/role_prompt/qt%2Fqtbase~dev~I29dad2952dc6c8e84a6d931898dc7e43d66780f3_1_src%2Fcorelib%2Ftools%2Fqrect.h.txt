After reviewing the provided Qt Base code, which defines the `QRect` and `QRectF` classes, I found no security defects. The code primarily consists of class definitions, constructors, getters, setters, and operations for rectangle manipulation. It handles geometric calculations and property management for rectangles.

Key Points:
- The methods use basic arithmetic operations and simple condition checks. There is no complex logic that could lead to security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or injection attacks.
- The use of `Q_DECL_CONSTEXPR` and `Q_DECL_RELAXED_CONSTEXPR` suggests that the functions are intended to be optimized at compile time where possible, reducing the runtime complexity.
- There are no indications of unsafe memory operations, such as manual memory allocation or array access, which are common sources of vulnerabilities in C++.
- The operations performed are arithmetic in nature and do not involve any operations that typically lead to security issues, such as network or file I/O, or handling user input in an insecure way.

Therefore, based on the given code snippet, **no security defects are detected in the code**.
