After reviewing the code, I have found no direct security defects in the provided code. The class handles the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy, which is a security feature itself, helping to ensure that connections are made over HTTPS.

However, I have a few recommendations and observations:

1. The destructor (`QHstsPolicy::~QHstsPolicy()`) appears to be empty. If `QHstsPolicyPrivate` has any dynamic allocations or resources that need to be released, they should be handled in the destructor. If the use of a smart pointer (like `QSharedPointer` or `QScopedPointer`) is considered for `d`, then the memory management would be automated.

2. There is no direct validation or sanitization of the `host` when setting it (in the constructor or the `setHost` method). Depending on how this class is used elsewhere in the application, you might want to validate the `host` to ensure it adheres to expected formats.

3. When dealing with dates and times, as in the `isExpired()` function, it's always a good idea to ensure the system's time can be trusted. If an attacker can manipulate the system's clock, they could potentially invalidate HSTS policies. However, this is more of a system-level concern than a code-level one.

4. Finally, while not a security issue, using direct member initialization in the `QHstsPolicyPrivate` class (as in `bool includeSubDomains = false;`) is a good practice. This ensures that members have default values without relying on constructors to set them.

To conclude, the provided code snippet does not contain direct security defects. However, ensuring the secure usage of this class would also depend on how it interacts with other components in the system and how it's utilized by the caller.
