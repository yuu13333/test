Upon review of the provided code, a few concerns and potential security issues stand out:

1. **Sensitive Data Clearing**:
    - `QSslKeyPrivate::clear(bool deep)` (lines 57-84): 
        - When security-sensitive structures like RSA, DSA, or EC keys are freed, merely setting the pointer to zero (e.g., `rsa = 0;`) doesn't ensure that the memory they occupied has been sanitized. For attackers who manage to access memory, remnants of these keys might still exist. 
        - **Solution**: Consider explicitly zeroing out memory regions holding security-sensitive data using functions like `memset()` before freeing them. However, be careful of compiler optimizations that might optimize away a "dead store."

2. **Direct Memory Manipulation**:
    - Lines 101-102 & 113-114: 
        - The `memcpy()` function is used to directly copy data structures, which can introduce potential security vulnerabilities if not carefully managed. For instance, if there's a mismatch between the size of the source and destination structures, it could lead to buffer overflows.
        - **Solution**: Ensure that the sizes of the structures being copied are indeed what you expect. Consider using safer alternatives to `memcpy()`, like copying structure fields individually.

3. **Password-Handling**:
    - Various functions handle passwords (e.g., `decodePem` in lines 147-187). The passphrase is passed around as a plain `QByteArray`, which means that it can be read from the memory if an attacker gets access.
        - **Solution**: Store sensitive information, like passwords, in a structure designed for secure storage that ensures data is cleared from memory after use.

4. **Cipher Mode Selection**:
    - Lines 230, 243, 257: It's hardcoded to use `q_EVP_des_ede3_cbc()`, which means Triple DES in CBC mode. While Triple DES isn't necessarily insecure, it's seen as deprecated in many cryptographic circles due to its block size.
        - **Solution**: Consider migrating to more modern algorithms like AES. Also, if possible, allow for a more flexible selection of encryption methods.

5. **Error Handling**:
    - Various functions (e.g., `decodePem` or `toPem`) invoke OpenSSL functions but don't seem to consistently handle potential errors. This can lead to undefined behavior or vulnerabilities.
        - **Solution**: Add thorough error handling and checks for all OpenSSL calls. Ensure that in case of an error, resources are properly freed, and operations are safely terminated.

6. **Memory Leak Considerations**:
    - There's a potential memory leak in `fromEVP_PKEY` (line 86-139) if the given `pkey` type is unknown. 
        - **Solution**: Ensure that you free any memory associated with `pkey` or handle unknown types properly.

7. **Potential Misuse of Crypto Primitives**:
    - The `doCrypt` function (starting at line 295) sets up cryptographic operations but is cut off in the provided snippet. This function is a potential hotspot for issues like incorrect initialization vector (IV) handling, cipher misuse, etc. 
        - **Solution**: The remainder of this function should be carefully reviewed to ensure it's using cryptographic primitives safely and correctly.

In summary, while many of the concerns listed might not be direct vulnerabilities, they can still pose security risks depending on the broader context in which this code is used. Improving error handling, being cautious with memory management, and updating cryptographic practices can help strengthen this code's security posture.
