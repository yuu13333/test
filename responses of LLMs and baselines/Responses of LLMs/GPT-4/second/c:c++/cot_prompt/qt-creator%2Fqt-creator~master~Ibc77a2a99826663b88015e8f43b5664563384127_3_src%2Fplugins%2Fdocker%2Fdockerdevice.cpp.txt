Analyzing the supplementary shell scripts you've asked to generate for security defects, here are the findings:

### 1. **`docker_search.sh`**
**Security Defects:**
- **Unsanitized Input (Command Injection Vulnerability):** The script uses user-supplied input directly in the `find` command without any sanitization or validation. This can lead to command injection if special characters or shell metacharacters are included in the input.

**Code Sample:**
```bash
find $search_dir \( -type f -o -type d \) \
  \( -readable -o -writable -o -executable \) -mindepth 1
```

**Line Number:** 12-14

**Solution:**
To mitigate this issue, you should sanitize the input by escaping special characters or by validating that the input matches an expected pattern (e.g., only alphanumeric characters, slashes for directory paths, etc.). This can be achieved by adding a validation step before executing the `find` command:

```bash
# Sanitize input for directory path
search_dir=$(echo "$1" | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9_/]//g')
```

### 2. **`update_docker_config.sh` and `test_docker_commands.sh`**
**Security Defects:**
- **Generic Scripts without Specific Defects:** These scripts currently contain placeholders or generic commands that do not interact with external input or perform critical operations based on such input. Therefore, they are not subject to command injection or other common shell script vulnerabilities in their current state.

**Conclusion:**
No specific security defects are detected in the `update_docker_config.sh` and `test_docker_commands.sh` scripts due to the lack of detailed implementation provided. However, when further developing these scripts, care should be taken to validate and sanitize any user or external inputs, handle errors gracefully, and manage permissions appropriately to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.

For `docker_search.sh`, implement the suggested solution to handle potential command injection vulnerabilities effectively.
