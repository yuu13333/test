Upon reviewing the provided code from the Qt library, focusing primarily on its security implications, the following considerations are made:

1. **Integer Overflows**: The use of integer calculations and conversions could potentially result in overflows. However, the calculations involving casting from `qreal` to `int` via intermediate `quint64` or similar types are designed to handle values within the expected range for typical use of mathematical functions like `ceil` and `floor`.

2. **Memory Access**: There is no direct memory access involving pointers that could be manipulated externally or lead to out-of-bounds errors in the provided functions. Functions primarily use local computations and standard library calls.

3. **Type Safety and Implicit Conversions**: The use of C++ standard library functions and explicit type casts helps ensure that type conversions do not lead to unintended behaviors or loss of precision in a manner that could be exploited.

4. **Array Access**: The sine table used in functions like `qFastSin` and `qFastCos` is accessed via calculated indices. While the indices are wrapped using bitwise operations to ensure they remain within bounds (`QT_SINE_TABLE_SIZE - 1`), there is an inherent assumption that `QT_SINE_TABLE_SIZE` is a power of two, which is typical for such implementations to ensure safe wrapping of indices.

```cpp
si &= QT_SINE_TABLE_SIZE - 1;
ci &= QT_SINE_TABLE_SIZE - 1;
```

This implementation ensures that the indices `si` and `ci` remain within the valid range of `0` to `QT_SINE_TABLE_SIZE - 1`, thus preventing any out-of-bounds memory access on the `qt_sine_table` array.

5. **Use of Constants and Macros**: The code uses a variety of pre-defined constants and macros (e.g., `M_PI`, `M_SQRT2`). These are used safely within mathematical expressions and do not lead to any known security defects.

**Conclusion**:
No security defects are detected in the code. The functions are carefully implemented to avoid common pitfalls such as integer overflows, improper type conversions, and out-of-bounds array access. The use of standard and mathematical library functions along with conservative programming practices in handling indices and types helps ensure the robustness of this implementation.
