After reviewing the provided code for the `QHstsPolicy` class and related operations, here's a detailed security analysis:

### Security Analysis of `QHstsPolicy` Class

1. **Data Encapsulation and Memory Management:**
   - The `QHstsPolicy` class uses a private pointer `d` to manage policy details such as URL, expiry, and whether subdomains are included. This design follows the Pimpl idiom, which is good for encapsulation and hiding implementation details.
   - The destructor and the copy/move assignment operators are correctly managing the private data, which is crucial for preventing memory leaks or dangling pointers.

2. **Expiry Check:**
   - The method `isExpired()` checks if the policy has a valid expiry date and compares it against the current UTC time. This method prevents the use of expired policies, which is critical for maintaining the security guarantees provided by HSTS.

3. **URL Handling:**
   - The class uses `QUrl` for storing the host, which is appropriate since `QUrl` provides robust parsing and validation mechanisms. This reduces the risk of security issues related to improper host name validation.

4. **Comparison Operator:**
   - The `operator==` ensures that two policies are considered equal only if they match in host, expiry, and subdomain inclusion settings. This precise matching is essential to avoid incorrectly treating different policies as the same, which could lead to security rule bypasses.

5. **Subdomain Inclusion:**
   - The handling of subdomains inclusion/exclusion is explicitly managed via a boolean flag. This clear distinction is crucial to ensure that policies correctly apply to the intended scope of domains.

### Potential Security Concerns (Hypothetical, not directly evident from provided code):

- **Improper Validation Against Top-Level Domains (TLDs):**
  - If the method setting the host does not validate against TLDs properly, it might accept malformed or risky domain names. However, since `QUrl`'s `setHost()` is used, which typically includes validation, this risk is generally mitigated.

- **Time Check Reliability:**
  - The method `isExpired()` relies on the system's current UTC time. If the system clock is wrong, this could improperly mark a policy as expired or not expired. It's generally recommended to use a reliable time source or ensure system time is synchronized with a network time protocol (NTP).

- **Lack of Synchronization in Multi-threaded Context:**
  - If `QHstsPolicy` objects are accessed from multiple threads, there could be concurrency issues since there's no synchronization mechanism in place in the provided code snippet. This is not directly a flaw in the provided code but could be a concern depending on how the class is used.

### Conclusion:

**No security defects are detected in the code** based on the provided segments. The design and implementation appear secure, assuming proper usage patterns and environmental configurations. The usage of `QUrl` and proper memory management practices significantly contribute to the robustness of this implementation.
