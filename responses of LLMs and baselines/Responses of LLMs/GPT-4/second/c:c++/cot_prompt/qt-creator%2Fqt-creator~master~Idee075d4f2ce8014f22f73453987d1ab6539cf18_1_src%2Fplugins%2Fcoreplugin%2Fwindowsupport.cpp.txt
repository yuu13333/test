After reviewing the provided code, there are no immediately apparent security defects specifically related to typical security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, SQL injections, or improper access controls within the context of the code. The code primarily handles user interface elements, actions, and window management within a Qt environment.

### Key Points Considered:

1. **Memory Management and Pointers**:
   - The code includes dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `new QAction(this)`). Memory management appears to be correctly handled through parent-child relationships inherent in Qt, where parent objects manage the lifetime of their children. There are also explicit deletions in destructors where needed (e.g., `delete m_contextObject;`), which is crucial to avoid memory leaks that could be exploited to exhaust system resources.

2. **Signal-Slot Connections**:
   - Qt's signal-slot mechanism is used for event handling (e.g., `connect(m_toggleFullScreenAction, &QAction::triggered, this, &WindowSupport::toggleFullScreen);`). Since signals and slots are type-safe and the connections are made using function pointers, typical vulnerabilities related to callbacks are mitigated.

3. **Use of Assertions**:
   - The use of assertions (e.g., `QTC_ASSERT`) helps in maintaining invariants and can prevent unexpected behavior in debug builds. However, assertions are usually compiled out in release builds, which means these checks should not be relied upon for runtime error handling or security enforcement.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The code does not directly handle external input that could be manipulated for injection attacks. Most functionality is related to internal state management and UI interactions within the application.

5. **Threading and Concurrency**:
   - There are no explicit manipulations of threads or concurrent operations that could lead to race conditions or deadlocks in the provided code snippets.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - The provided code snippets do not show extensive error handling logic, particularly related to the failure of window or action operations. However, this typically does not lead to security defects unless the errors relate to security-sensitive operations, which they do not appear to in this context.

### Conclusion:

**No security defects are detected in the code** based on the information available in the provided snippets. The code seems to manage UI-related operations with good practices in memory management and encapsulation, typical of well-written Qt applications. However, a deeper analysis including the full application context, especially components that interact with external systems or handle user data, would be required for a comprehensive security audit.
