Let's analyze the provided code for security defects:

1. **Handling of `std::vector` in `processMethods`:**
   ```cpp
   void processMethods(std::vector<MetaMethod> metaMethods) {
       for (const MetaMethod& method : metaMethods) {
           // Process method
       }
   }
   ```
   This code does not exhibit any direct security defects in its current form. However, it is inefficient because the vector `metaMethods` is passed by value, which means a copy of the vector is made when the function is called. While this is not a security defect per se, it could potentially lead to performance issues, especially with large vectors.

2. **Function `createMetaMethods`:**
   ```cpp
   std::vector<MetaMethod> createMetaMethods() {
       std::vector<MetaMethod> methods;
       // populate the vector
       return methods;
   }
   ```
   This function is straightforward and returns a vector of `MetaMethod` objects. Since C++11, the return of local objects like this will generally be moved rather than copied due to the Return Value Optimization (RVO) or move semantics, so there are no inherent security issues or unnecessary copies here.

3. **Function `main`:**
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       std::vector<MetaMethod> methods = createMetaMethods();
       processMethods(methods);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   In this snippet, the vector `methods` is created and filled by `createMetaMethods`, then passed to `processMethods`. Again, there are no direct security defects. The usage is typical and correct under standard circumstances.

### Conclusion:
No security defects are detected in the code.

The primary concern here is more about optimization rather than security. As previously discussed, passing `metaMethods` by value in `processMethods` could be optimized by using a reference to avoid unnecessary copying, but this is not a security issue.
