After thoroughly analyzing the provided code, which predominantly deals with the definitions and implementations of the `QPoint` and `QPointF` classes in the Qt library, here are the findings regarding security defects:

1. **Use of `qRound` and Divisions**: The use of `qRound` and division operations in methods that involve scaling or converting points and sizes is prevalent. While these operations are generally safe, there are concerns if the divisor could be zero, which would lead to undefined behavior.

    For example:
    - Line 300: `Q_ASSERT(divisor < 0 || divisor > 0);` is used to ensure the divisor is not zero before division, which is a proactive check.
    
    This use of `Q_ASSERT` is crucial for debug builds to catch errors early. However, in release builds where `Q_ASSERT` might be disabled, it's essential to ensure that such checks still prevent undefined behavior or exceptions.

2. **Floating-Point Comparisons**: The comparison operations for floating-point numbers use `qFuzzyCompare` and `qFuzzyIsNull` to avoid issues with floating-point precision.
    
    For example:
    - Lines 277-278: The implementation ensures that floating-point comparisons account for precision issues, which is a good practice to avoid erroneous behavior due to floating-point arithmetic peculiarities.

No other direct security defects, such as buffer overflows, uncontrolled format strings, use of uninitialized variables, or out-of-bound accesses, are observed in the code provided. The code handles type safety well and uses modern C++ practices such as constexpr and noexcept, which enhance both performance and safety by enforcing immutability and exception safety where appropriate.

**Conclusion**: No security defects are detected in the code.

This analysis is based on the provided snippet and assumes that the surrounding infrastructure and other code segments adhere to similar standards of quality and safety. If the code interacts with external systems or data, additional considerations regarding input validation and error handling should be examined.
