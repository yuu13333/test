Upon reviewing the provided code that implements custom `QtPrivate::mutex` and `QtPrivate::condition_variable` for the Qt framework, particularly for the Integrity operating system, let's examine potential security and safety concerns.

### Code Analysis

The code snippet primarily involves wrapping `QMutex` and `QWaitCondition` to mimic `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable` behavior. Here are key points of concern typically checked in such contexts:

1. **Deadlock Potential**: Ensuring that the lock and unlock operations are correctly implemented to avoid deadlocks. The `mutex` class correctly delegates `lock()`, `unlock()`, and `try_lock()` operations to its private `QMutex` base class, ensuring that the locking behavior is preserved and consistent with `QMutex`.

2. **Exception Safety**: Custom wait functions (`wait`, `wait_for`, `wait_until`) in the `condition_variable` class must handle exceptions correctly, especially since they are involved in loop and conditional wait scenarios. It's important that the lock state is correctly managed across exceptions.

3. **Correctness of Condition Checking**: The loop used in the `wait_for` and `wait_until` functions with predicates needs to correctly re-check the predicate upon waking and before exiting, ensuring that spurious wake-ups are correctly handled.

4. **Concurrency and Race Conditions**: As the implementation wraps existing Qt concurrency primitives (`QMutex` and `QWaitCondition`), the inherent thread-safety of these classes is largely dependent on their correct usage and the underlying implementation in Qt.

5. **Resource Leaks and Lifetime Management**: There is no dynamic allocation directly in the provided code; resource management is handled by the `QMutex` and `QWaitCondition` objects according to Qt's lifetime management practices.

### Specific Observations

Upon detailed inspection, here are specific observations related to security and robustness:

- **Locking Protocol**: The mutex is used in a straightforward manner without recursive locks or complex locking schemes that could lead to deadlocks. The functions do not use lock acquisition in a manner that could lead to inversion or priority issues.
  
- **Exception Safety and Error Handling**: There is no explicit error handling or exception throwing in the provided methods, but since the Qt classes (like `QMutex` and `QWaitCondition`) are used internally, any exceptions thrown by these classes need to be properly documented or handled if they are to propagate out of the QtPrivate classes.

- **Resource Management**: The use of `std::unique_lock` in the wait functions suggests correct management of lock scope and exception safety regarding the lock state during wait operations.

### Conclusion

**No security defects are detected in the code.**

The implementation correctly delegates functionality to existing Qt classes, which should handle their respective concurrency primitives appropriately. As long as `QMutex` and `QWaitCondition` are free from defects and are used as intended, the custom `QtPrivate::mutex` and `QtPrivate::condition_variable` classes should also be secure and behave correctly under concurrent conditions. The reliance on the Qt framework's own implementation details encapsulates most potential issues within the tried and tested Qt codebase, rather than in this new layer of abstraction.
