Upon reviewing the provided Qt C++ code, which is primarily focused on managing calendar systems with various backends, the main areas of scrutiny for security defects would include:

1. **Memory Management**: The code largely relies on manual memory management for calendar backend objects, which can lead to security vulnerabilities related to memory leaks, double free errors, and dangling pointers if not handled carefully. However, the code provided does not show explicit deletion of objects, suggesting a potential shift towards smart pointers as mentioned in the commit message but not fully implemented in the provided code segment.

2. **Resource Access and Concurrency**: The code uses `QReadWriteLock` for synchronization, which is appropriate for preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety when accessing shared resources. This is crucial in a multi-threaded environment to prevent data corruption and inconsistency.

3. **Pointer and Object Validity**: Assertions (`Q_ASSERT`) are used extensively to check the validity of backend objects before performing operations on them. This is a good practice as it helps in identifying issues early in the development phase but does not prevent issues in a production environment since assertions are typically disabled in release builds.

4. **Error Handling and Logging**: The code includes logging warnings (`qWarning()`) for duplicate names during backend registration. Proper handling of such conditions is vital to prevent unexpected behavior.

Specifically, there are no glaring security defects such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other common vulnerabilities directly observable in the provided segments. However, the transition to `QSharedPointer` for managing backend objects, as suggested in the commit message, would improve the security and robustness of the code by automatically handling memory deallocation and preventing common memory management errors.

**Solution Suggestion:**
- Fully implement the use of `QSharedPointer` for all backend pointers to prevent potential memory management issues. Ensure all functions that deal with raw pointers are refactored to use smart pointers, which would provide automatic, exception-safe memory management, reducing the risk of memory leaks and dangling pointers.

**Conclusion:**
No explicit security defects are detected in the provided code based on the review. The major recommendation is to complete the implementation of `QSharedPointer` for memory safety improvements, which aligns with the intent of the commit message to enhance resource management upon program exit.
