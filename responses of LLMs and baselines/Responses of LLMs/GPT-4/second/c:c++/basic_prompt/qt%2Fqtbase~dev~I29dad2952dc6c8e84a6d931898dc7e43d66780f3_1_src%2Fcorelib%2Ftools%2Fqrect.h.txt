After reviewing the provided code thoroughly, I have not identified any explicit security defects. The code consists primarily of definitions and implementations for geometric rectangle manipulation using the `QRect` and `QRectF` classes within the Qt framework. These include various operations such as setting and modifying rectangle dimensions, translation, and checking properties like containment, intersection, and size adjustments.

The implementation adheres to C++ best practices for type safety and ensures strong type checking with `noexcept` and `constexpr` specifiers to optimize and safeguard against exceptions. The use of inlining and constant expressions ensures both efficiency and correctness without unnecessary runtime overhead or mutable state that could introduce security risks.

The use of pointers in functions like `getRect()` and `setCoords()` (lines 379-401 and 395-406 respectively) could be scrutinized for potential issues, but these functions are used correctly within the context of the class's design, assuming that the caller adheres to appropriate memory management practices.

Overall, **no security defects are detected in the code**. The design appears to be focused on performance and correctness, leveraging C++ language features effectively to maintain both safety and efficiency. If you have specific security concerns or scenarios in mind, I could look further into those aspects.
