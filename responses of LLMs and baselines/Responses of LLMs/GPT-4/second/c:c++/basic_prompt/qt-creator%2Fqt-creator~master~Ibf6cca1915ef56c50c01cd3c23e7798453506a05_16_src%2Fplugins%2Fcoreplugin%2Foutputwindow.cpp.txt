The code provided for review, which pertains to the `OutputWindow` class managing a text display area in a Qt-based application, seems generally robust but exhibits a potential issue related to the dynamic management of memory. The issue detected is with the handling of the destruction of an `OutputWindow` instance:

1. **Potential Use-After-Free Vulnerability (Lines 56-58):**
   - When an `OutputWindow` instance is destructed, the destructor of `OutputWindowPrivate` deletes `outputWindowContext` which had been previously removed from a context management mechanism in `ICore::removeContextObject(outputWindowContext)`.
   - Although the deletion itself is valid, there is a potential use-after-free issue if other parts of the program attempt to access `outputWindowContext` after it has been removed but before the destruction of `OutputWindowPrivate`. This might occur if asynchronous events or other threads still hold references to this object.
   - **Solution:**
     - Ensure the safety of the deletion by potentially using a smart pointer (like `std::shared_ptr` or `QSharedPointer`) for `outputWindowContext` to manage its lifetime automatically. With smart pointers, the object will only be deleted once all references to it are out of scope.
     - It's also important to ensure that no other parts of the application can access `outputWindowContext` after it's removed from `ICore`. This can be managed by documenting ownership and access guidelines or by implementing additional checks before accessing it.

These considerations would help improve the robustness of memory management in the code and avoid potential crashes or undefined behaviors due to dangling pointers.
