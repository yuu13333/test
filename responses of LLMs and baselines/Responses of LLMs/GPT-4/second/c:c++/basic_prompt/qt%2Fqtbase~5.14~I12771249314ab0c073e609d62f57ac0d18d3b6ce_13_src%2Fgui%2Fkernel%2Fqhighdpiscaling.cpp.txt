No security defects are detected in the code provided.

The code primarily deals with handling high DPI scaling configurations within a Qt application environment, focusing on scaling factors and environment variables related to display properties. It correctly uses environment variables for configuration without exposing sensitive system details or modifying system settings directly. The implementation methods such as `qEnvironmentVariableIntValue` and checks for validity (`ok`) ensure that the input handling is safely managed, preventing typical errors such as buffer overflows or uncontrolled format strings.

Furthermore, the code does not involve network operations, file system access, or other common areas where security vulnerabilities like injection or resource leaks often arise. The provided code functions internally within defined Qt interfaces and adheres to proper handling of external input (environment variables) by validating them before use.

In summary, based on the provided excerpt, the code handles its specific operations securely with respect to its scope of configuration and display settings manipulation within a Qt application context.
