No security defects are detected in the code. 

The code primarily deals with file system operations such as permissions management, file metadata handling, and symbolic link behaviors across different operating systems. It appropriately handles permissions and utilizes secure system calls like `QT_OPEN`, `QT_CLOSE`, and `chmod`. It checks for the existence of files and directories before performing operations, effectively preventing actions on invalid paths.

The tests and functions are well-contained, with error handling mechanisms in place to manage and report failures appropriately using the `QSystemError` class, ensuring that exceptions or errors during file operations are caught and handled, thus maintaining the robustness and security of the application.

There are no explicit or clear security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, unchecked user inputs, or inappropriate error handling that would typically be flagged in a security review of such code.
