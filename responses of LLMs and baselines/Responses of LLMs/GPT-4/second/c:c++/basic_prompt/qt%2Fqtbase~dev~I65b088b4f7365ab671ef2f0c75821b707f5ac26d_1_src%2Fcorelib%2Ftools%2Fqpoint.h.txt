Upon reviewing the provided code, there is one security defect related to improper validation of divisor values in division operations, which can lead to undefined behavior or crashes due to division by zero. This is found in the following line:

- **Line 107**: The division operation for `QPoint` does not include any checks to ensure the divisor is not zero before performing the division. The absence of such a check can result in a division by zero, which is undefined behavior in C++ and may crash the program or lead to unexpected results.

**Solution**:
To address this issue, it's advisable to add a precondition check to ensure the divisor is not zero before performing the division. Here is how you can modify the code:

```cpp
friend constexpr inline QPoint operator/(const QPoint &p, qreal c)
{
    Q_ASSERT(c != 0);  // Ensure the divisor is not zero
    return QPoint(qRound(p.xp / c), qRound(p.yp / c));
}
```

This uses `Q_ASSERT` to ensure that `c` is not zero. If `c` is zero, `Q_ASSERT` will terminate the program (in debug builds) or at least flag the issue prominently. For release builds, you might consider more robust error handling to ensure the program can gracefully handle attempts to divide by zero.
