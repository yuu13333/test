After reviewing the code provided, I have identified a potential security defect in the implementation of the length calculation for a character string, which could result in incorrect behavior or possibly undefined behavior. Here's the issue:

**Security Defect:**
- **File:** QStringView.h
- **Function:** length
- **Code Lines:** 90-97

**Description of the Issue:**
- The `length` function is intended to calculate the length of a null-terminated string by iterating through each character until it finds the null terminator. However, there is a critical mistake in the loop condition at line 94. The expression `!str--` is intended to be a null check, but due to the post-decrement operator `--`, it decreases the pointer before the check is performed. This not only results in skipping the null character check for the first character of the string, but also may access memory out of the bounds of the string data, leading to undefined behavior.

**Correct Implementation:**
- The correct implementation should involve iterating through the string without modifying the original pointer until the null terminator is found. A typical and safer approach would be to use `while (*str) { str++; result++; }` which checks the value pointed by `str` before incrementing the pointer and the counter.

**Suggested Solution:**
```cpp
template <typename Char>
Q_DECL_RELAXED_CONSTEXPR size_t length(const Char *str) Q_DECL_NOTHROW
{
    size_t result = 0;
    if (str) {
        while (*str) { // Correct check for null terminator before incrementing
            str++;
            result++;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

By applying this fix, you ensure that the function correctly calculates the length of a string up to the null terminator, without risking out-of-bounds memory access.
