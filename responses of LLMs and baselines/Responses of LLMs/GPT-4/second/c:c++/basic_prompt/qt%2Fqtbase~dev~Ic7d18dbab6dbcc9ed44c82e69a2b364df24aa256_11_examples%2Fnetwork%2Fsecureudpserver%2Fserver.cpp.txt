The code snippet you provided appears to configure and manage a DTLS server using the Qt network library. I have identified a significant security issue related to the handling of DTLS connections:

### Security Issue

**Improper Certificate Verification**:
- **Location**: Line 95
- **Description**: The server is configured to not verify peer certificates (`serverConfiguration.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyNone);`). This means that the server does not validate the authenticity of the DTLS client, which makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. By not validating certificates, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate client using a forged or invalid certificate.
- **Risk**: High. This configuration allows any client, regardless of the authenticity of its certificate, to establish a connection, which could potentially compromise the security of the communication.
- **Solution**: It is recommended to set the peer verification mode to `QSslSocket::VerifyPeer` or `QSslSocket::QueryPeer`, depending on whether the application requires mandatory client authentication or should request but not necessarily require it. This change will enforce certificate validation and increase the security of the DTLS sessions.

### Recommended Code Adjustment

To enhance security, consider modifying line 95 from:
```cpp
serverConfiguration.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyNone);
```
to:
```cpp
serverConfiguration.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyPeer);
```

This change ensures that the server verifies the certificates presented by clients, which is crucial for securing communications in a DTLS session.
