No security defects are detected in the code.

The code provided primarily defines the `QHstsPolicy` class and its operations within a Qt-based framework. The class manages HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policies, which help to secure HTTP connections by enforcing them to be conducted over HTTPS. Here are some security-related observations:

1. **Data Privacy and Integrity**: The use of HSTS as indicated by the `QHstsPolicy` class (lines 57-61) is a good practice for enhancing security by ensuring that connections to specific hosts occur over HTTPS only. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. **URL Parsing**: The `QHstsPolicy` constructor and `setHost` method (lines 96 and 144) use `QUrl::setHost()` which involves URL parsing. The passing of `QUrl::ParsingMode` as a parameter allows for some control over how URLs are parsed, which is essential to handle user input correctly and avoid security issues such as improper input handling.

3. **Expiration Check**: The method `isExpired` (lines 214-216) checks if the policy's expiry date is valid and if it has passed. This is crucial for ensuring that expired policies are not erroneously considered valid, which could potentially allow connections that should be secure to occur over insecure channels.

4. **Proper Memory Management**: The use of smart pointers or equivalent mechanisms is not explicitly shown but can be inferred from the syntax (e.g., `d(new QHstsPolicyPrivate)` in lines 85, 98, 109), which suggests proper management of dynamic memory. This helps prevent memory leaks, which can lead to denial of service.

5. **Comparison Operations**: The equality operator (lines 203-206) correctly checks for the equivalence of host, expiry, and subdomains inclusion settings between two policy instances. This ensures that policy comparisons are thorough and accurate, preventing logical errors in handling HSTS policies.

Overall, the implementation seems secure based on the provided snippet. However, without the complete code, especially how the `QHstsPolicy` interacts with network connections in `QNetworkAccessManager`, a comprehensive security audit cannot be entirely conclusive. It would be advisable to review all points where user input might interact with this class and ensure that external inputs are validated appropriately.
