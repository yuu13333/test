No security defects are detected in the code provided. The code is primarily focused on geometrical calculations and data structure manipulations specific to triangulation processes, without involving typical security-sensitive operations such as file I/O, network communications, or handling user input that might be vulnerable to injection attacks. It correctly handles memory and data within its defined structures without exposing raw pointers or allowing buffer overflows. Additionally, all arithmetic operations involving indices and sizes are bounded by the structures' limits, thus preventing out-of-bounds errors.
