After thoroughly reviewing the provided code snippet, I found no security defects. The code primarily consists of definitions and implementations for classes `QLine` and `QLineF`, handling basic geometric line operations. These include constructors, accessors, mutators, and operators. The methods deal with simple mathematical operations and property manipulations, without engaging in any external system interactions, network communications, file operations, or handling of untrusted input that could typically pose security risks.

Furthermore, there are no apparent buffer overflows, use of uninitialized variables, or unsafe type conversions that might otherwise introduce vulnerabilities like memory corruption. All operations remain confined within the scope of their respective class and data structures, with type safety being maintained through the use of C++ classes and methods.

Therefore, I conclude that no security defects are detected in the code.
