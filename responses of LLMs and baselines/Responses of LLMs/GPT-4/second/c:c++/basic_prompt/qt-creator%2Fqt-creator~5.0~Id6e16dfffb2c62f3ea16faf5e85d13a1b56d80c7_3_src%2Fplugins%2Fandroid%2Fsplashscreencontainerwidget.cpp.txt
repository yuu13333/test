The code provided is a complex and extensive Qt-based implementation for handling different aspects of splash screen configurations for various screen densities in an application. While the code covers many functionalities related to UI components, scaling, and file handling, I identified a potential security defect concerning file path handling that could pose a risk:

**Security Defect:**
- **Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability (Line 410):** The function `loadSplashscreenDrawParams` constructs a file path using string concatenation, which incorporates user input from the function `manifestDir`. This method retrieves the directory path from a `TextEditorWidget` object's document path, which could potentially be manipulated. If an attacker can influence the output of `manifestDir()`, they could potentially construct a path that points to arbitrary files on the system. This would allow the application to read from any file accessible to the application's process, leading to information disclosure.

**Proposed Solution:**
- **Sanitize and Validate Paths:** Ensure that the directory path obtained from the `TextEditorWidget` is within expected bounds or directories. Implement checks to validate that the resulting paths from concatenations strictly refer to intended directories or files related to the application.
- **Use Secure APIs:** Utilize Qt's more secure file and path handling APIs, like `QDir::cleanPath` to normalize paths and prevent path traversal issues.
- **Access Control:** Implement proper access control checks to ensure that the paths being accessed are permitted for the user and context in which the application is running.

Implementing these improvements can help mitigate the risk of arbitrary file access and protect against potential information disclosure vulnerabilities in the application.
