No security defects are detected in the code provided.

The code is well-structured with appropriate usage of mutexes for thread safety, and exception handling is in place for operations that might throw exceptions (lines 96-108). The implementation also appropriately checks and manages the state of runnables and threads, properly cleaning up resources where necessary.

The implementation of `QThreadPool` and related classes seems robust without obvious security flaws like race conditions, buffer overflows, or unhandled exceptional cases that would typically manifest as security defects in such context.
