No security defects are detected in the code.

The code provided primarily deals with handling screen and window properties for a WebAssembly module using Qt. The functions involve getting and setting screen properties, handling canvas sizes, and integrating with WebGL via Emscripten bindings. There are no explicit security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, unchecked user input, or insecure data handling that can typically be identified in a code review without the context of how these functions are used within the larger application.

The use of Emscripten and WebAssembly requires careful consideration regarding memory safety and access permissions, but these aspects are generally handled by the Emscripten framework itself and the design of the WebAssembly sandbox. 

Therefore, unless there's more context on how the data is used or what kind of external data might interact with these functions, the provided snippet does not show typical security issues.
