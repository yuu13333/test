No security defects are detected in the code.

However, it's important to note that the review focused solely on security aspects. Other types of defects, such as those related to performance, error handling, or best coding practices, may still exist and would require a different focus for detection and resolution. Additionally, for robust security and quality assurance, it would be advisable to conduct further testing and code analysis using appropriate tools and methodologies.
