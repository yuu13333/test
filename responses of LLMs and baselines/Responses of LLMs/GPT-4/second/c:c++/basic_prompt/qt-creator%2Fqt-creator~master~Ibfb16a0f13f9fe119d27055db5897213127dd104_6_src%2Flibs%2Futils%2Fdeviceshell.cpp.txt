The provided code, while comprehensive and handling threading and process control meticulously, does contain security vulnerabilities related to command injection. Here's a breakdown of the security defect found:

### Security Defect: Command Injection Vulnerability

**Lines: 97, 169**

The code constructs shell commands by directly incorporating user-controlled data (`stdInData`) without adequate sanitization. Specifically, it attempts to safely encode this data by converting it to Base64 and then decoding it within the shell command. However, Base64 encoding is not a safe mechanism to prevent shell command injection, as it only encodes data but does not remove or escape potentially harmful shell metacharacters. This can lead to situations where an attacker might control the content of `stdInData` to execute arbitrary commands.

**Vulnerable Code**:
```cpp
97         prefix = "echo '" + QString::fromUtf8(stdInData.toBase64()) + "' | base64 -d | ";
169        prefix = "echo '" + QString::fromUtf8(stdInData.toBase64()) + "' | base64 -d | ";
```

### Solution
To mitigate this vulnerability, any data incorporated into shell commands should be properly sanitized or escaped to prevent command injection. Here are possible solutions:

1. **Use Safer APIs**: Avoid constructing shell commands with direct string concatenations. Instead, use APIs that can execute commands and handle inputs safely without passing through a shell, or ensure that any command-line interfaces used provide strong sanitization.
   
2. **Proper Escaping**: If you must pass user input to shell commands, ensure that any potentially dangerous characters are escaped. For C++ and shell interaction, using a library designed to handle such cases safely or applying strict whitelisting on allowed characters can be effective.

3. **Restrict Input**: Limit the type of data that can be sent via `stdInData` to reduce the risk of injection. This can include strict type constraints, character set limitations, and length restrictions.

4. **Security Review and Testing**: Regularly review and test the code for security vulnerabilities, considering dynamic data handling and potential external inputs.

By addressing these issues, the code can be made more secure against command injection threats.
