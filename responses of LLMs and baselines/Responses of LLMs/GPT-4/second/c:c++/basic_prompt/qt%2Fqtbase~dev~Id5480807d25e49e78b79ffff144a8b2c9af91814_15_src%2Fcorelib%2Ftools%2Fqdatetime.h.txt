No security defects are detected in the code provided.

The code is a header file from the Qt library, defining classes `QDate`, `QTime`, and `QDateTime` to handle date and time operations. The implementation mainly involves constructors, setters, getters, and methods for date-time manipulation and comparison. It uses constants, inline functions, and conditional compilation to tailor functionality for different operating systems and Qt configurations.

From the provided code snippet, no direct security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, uncontrolled format strings, or insecure data handling are evident. The methods primarily handle date-time values safely, with checks for validity and boundaries where necessary, such as in the `isValid()` methods for date and time.

This analysis assumes that the external methods and operators not defined within this snippet, like `QDataStream` operations, are implemented securely in their respective modules.
