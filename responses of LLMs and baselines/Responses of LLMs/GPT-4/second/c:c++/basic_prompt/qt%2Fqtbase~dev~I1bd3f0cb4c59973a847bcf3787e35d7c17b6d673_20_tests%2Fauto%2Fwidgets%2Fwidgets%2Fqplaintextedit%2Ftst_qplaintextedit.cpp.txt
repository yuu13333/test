No security defects are detected in the code.

The code appears to be well-formed with proper handling of memory allocation, object management, and UI interaction without exposing any apparent vulnerabilities or security risks. The use of features like undo/redo functionality, clipboard management, and text editing operations are safely encapsulated within the Qt framework's APIs, which generally follow best practices to ensure security. There are also appropriate checks and guards, such as conditions that skip tests under certain environments, ensuring that operations do not proceed under unsupported conditions.
