Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a potential security defect related to the launching of processes using system commands. Here is the detail of the security concern:

### Security Defect

**Use of `system()` function:**  
- **Line number:** 163
- **Description:** The use of `system()` to launch commands introduces a risk of command injection, where an attacker could potentially manipulate the input to execute arbitrary commands on the system. This occurs if the `command` string, which includes user input from the URL, is manipulated maliciously.
- **Solution:** To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to replace the `system()` call with more secure alternatives such as `QProcess::startDetached()`, which is already used in the code under a different configuration directive. `QProcess` ensures that the command and its arguments are properly separated and handled, reducing the risk of injection.

### Suggested Code Modification

Replace the usage of `system()` with `QProcess::startDetached()` consistently, irrespective of the QT configuration. Here's the suggested change:

**Original line:**
```cpp
const bool ok = ::system(qPrintable(command + QLatin1String(" &")));
```

**Revised line:**
```cpp
const bool ok = QProcess::startDetached(command);
```

This change ensures that the command execution pathway is consistent and secure across different configurations and does not depend on conditional compilation flags, which might lead to the unsafe `system()` being used.

By making this adjustment, the code would be safer against potential exploitation via command injection vulnerabilities.
