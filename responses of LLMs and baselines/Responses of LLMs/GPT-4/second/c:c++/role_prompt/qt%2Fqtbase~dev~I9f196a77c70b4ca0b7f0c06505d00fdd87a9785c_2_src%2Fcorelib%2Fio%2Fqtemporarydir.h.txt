No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided code snippet is a header file from the Qt framework, specifically for the `QTemporaryDir` class, which manages temporary directories. The header file mainly includes class declarations, constructors, destructors, method declarations, and private member declarations. There are no implementations of methods in this snippet where typical vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or improper input validations can occur.

Furthermore, the use of modern C++ practices such as `QScopedPointer` and move semantics (`std::exchange` in the move constructor and assignment operator) suggests that the management of resources is handled correctly, reducing the likelihood of memory leaks or dangling pointers, which are common issues in C++.

However, it's essential to review the corresponding source file (`*.cpp`) where these methods are implemented to ensure that no security defects exist in the actual handling of file system operations, error handling, or data processing.
