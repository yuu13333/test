The provided code snippet is well-structured and implements several functionalities related to window management in a Qt application. However, I have identified a potential security defect related to how signals and slots are connected, which could lead to security risks if not handled properly. Here's the detail:

### Potential Security Defect:
**Signal-Slot Connections with Lambda Captures (Line 85):** The connection made on line 85 uses a lambda function that captures `this` pointer to handle the signal `coreAboutToClose`. Capturing `this` in a lambda that is connected to a signal can be risky if the object that `this` refers to is destroyed before the signal is disconnected or emitted, leading to undefined behavior or crashes. This is particularly critical in applications where object lifetime can vary dynamically, and signals might be emitted from different threads or during object destruction phases.

### Solution:
To mitigate the risk, ensure that all signals connected using lambdas that capture `this` are properly disconnected in the destructor or before the object is potentially destroyed. Additionally, using Qt's `QPointer` to manage the lifetime within lambda captures or checking for nullity (if `QPointer` is used) before accessing object methods or properties can help prevent accessing invalid memory. Here's how you can modify the code to include such a check:

```cpp
connect(ICore::instance(), &ICore::coreAboutToClose, this, [this]() {
    if (!this) return;  // Checks if the object still exists
    m_shutdown = true;
});
```

By incorporating these changes, you can enhance the robustness of the code against potential crashes or undefined behavior resulting from improper signal-slot connections involving object pointers.
