No security defects are detected in the code.

The code provided is part of the Qt Base implementation, specifically for managing calendar backends and their registration within the Qt framework. The class structures, methods, and usage of synchronization mechanisms (like read-write locks) are correctly implemented to ensure thread safety and data consistency across calendar backend operations. The operations handling calendar backend registration, querying, and basic calendar functions follow good coding practices, utilize assertions to maintain invariants, and handle potential concurrency issues appropriately.
