No security defects are detected in the code provided.

The code largely defines a `QStringView` class which serves as a non-owning view into a string. The methods provided are mostly constructors, comparison operators, and conversion functions. It is well-structured and adheres to good C++ practices, like using `std::enable_if` for SFINAE and `Q_DECL_NOTHROW` to mark no-throw methods, which are typical in robust, type-safe template code.

Key aspects considered include:
- **Memory Safety**: There appears to be no direct memory management by `QStringView`, as it does not own the data it points to. Thus, there are no apparent risks of memory leaks or double deletion in the provided code.
- **Buffer Overflows**: The methods use safe operations on pointers and lengths passed to them. Constructors and conversion functions that involve pointers are correctly calculating sizes and do not perform any risky operations that might lead to buffer overflow.
- **Type Safety**: The use of templates and type traits helps ensure that operations are performed on compatible types, preventing type-related errors or undefined behavior.

This analysis assumes that external code interacting with `QStringView` handles memory ownership and bounds correctly, as `QStringView` itself does not manage the data it represents. If there are defects related to how `QStringView` is used (e.g., passing a dangling pointer), those would need to be addressed in the code that creates and manages the original data, not within `QStringView` itself.
