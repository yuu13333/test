No security defects are detected in the code provided. The code follows good practices for memory management, input validation, and use of Qt APIs for UI and settings management. However, it's always recommended to ensure that all external input, especially those involving IDs or keys, is validated against expected formats or ranges to prevent logical errors that might lead to security vulnerabilities. Also, ongoing code audits and testing (especially dynamic testing) are crucial to maintaining security over time as the codebase evolves.
