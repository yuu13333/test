After reviewing the provided Qt Base code focusing on the `QPoint` and `QPointF` classes, no security defects related to common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, or race conditions are detected in this code. The code mostly consists of class definitions with inline member functions for basic arithmetic and comparison operations, which are implemented safely within the bounds of modern C++ best practices.

Here are some observations on safety aspects:
- The use of `constexpr` and `noexcept` suggests that functions are intended to be evaluated at compile time when possible and do not throw exceptions. This use is consistent and correct across the code.
- The operations on internal class members (`xp` and `yp`) are basic arithmetic operations without any complex logic that could lead to undefined behavior.
- The code includes assertions (e.g., `Q_ASSERT` in line 415) to ensure that certain conditions (like non-zero divisors in division operations) are met before proceeding, which helps avoid runtime errors like division by zero.

Overall, the implementation adheres to good coding standards and safety practices suitable for the operations it performs. There are no security defects detected in this code based on the provided segment.
