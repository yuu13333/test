No security defects are detected in the code. The implementation uses appropriate concurrency mechanisms, such as mutexes and atomic operations, to ensure thread safety in accessing and modifying shared data structures. Additionally, it properly handles memory management by deallocating memory in the destructor and checking for successful registrations to prevent memory leaks. The code also includes necessary error checks and assertions to validate input and state assumptions.
