After reviewing the provided code, I have identified a potential security defect related to memory handling:

### Security Defect: Potential Memory Leak
#### Description:
The code potentially exhibits a memory leak issue due to manual memory management of dynamically allocated memory. The use of raw pointers and manual deallocation can be error-prone and might lead to memory not being freed if exceptions are thrown or if certain conditions are not met.

#### Relevant Code:
Lines 432 and 437 (`releaseKey` and `clear` functions) deal with releasing keys and clearing the cache, respectively. These functions manually manage memory (using `delete` and `free`), which can lead to memory leaks, particularly if these functions fail to execute fully due to earlier returns or exceptions.

#### Suggested Solution:
Switch to smart pointers, such as `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`, for automatic memory management. This change would ensure that memory is automatically managed and released when the pointer goes out of scope or is no longer needed, thereby preventing memory leaks.

#### Code Suggestion:
- Replace raw pointer usage with smart pointers.
- Modify the memory allocation and deallocation logic to accommodate smart pointers.

By implementing these changes, the code will become more robust against memory leaks and easier to maintain, especially in a complex environment like Qt where object lifecycles can be difficult to manage manually.
