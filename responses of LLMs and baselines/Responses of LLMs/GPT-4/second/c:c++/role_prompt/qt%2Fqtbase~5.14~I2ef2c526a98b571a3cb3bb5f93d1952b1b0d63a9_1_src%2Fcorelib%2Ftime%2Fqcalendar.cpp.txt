No security defects are detected in the code.

This code provides an implementation for a calendar system in Qt, including backend operations for various calendar calculations and registrations. The code primarily handles calendar registration, name handling, and basic calendar functionalities like determining leap years, the number of days or months, and other date-related calculations. There are no apparent security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, improper memory management, or insecure data handling in this particular portion of code. The destructors and memory management routines, like those seen in the `Registry` class, use safe Qt practices, such as `qDeleteAll` for cleaning up pointers. Additionally, the code properly uses assertions and checks to prevent out-of-bounds access or invalid operations on data structures, such as calendars and date calculations.
