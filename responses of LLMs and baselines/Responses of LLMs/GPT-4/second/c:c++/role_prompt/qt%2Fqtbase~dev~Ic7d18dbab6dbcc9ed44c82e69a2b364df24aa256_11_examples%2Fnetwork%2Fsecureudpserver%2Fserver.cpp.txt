The provided code implements a DTLS server using Qt's networking capabilities. After reviewing the code, there is one notable security defect related to the DTLS configuration, specifically:

### Security Defect:
1. **Insecure SSL Configuration**:
   - **Location**: Line 95
   - **Description**: The server's SSL configuration sets the peer verification mode to `QSslSocket::VerifyNone`, which means the server does not attempt to verify the SSL certificates presented by clients during the SSL handshake. This lack of verification can expose the server to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker could present a fake certificate, and the server would accept it without any validation.
   - **Solution**: To address this security defect, the server should be configured to validate client certificates unless there's a specific requirement or scenario where clients cannot provide valid certificates. A more secure default setting would be `QSslSocket::VerifyPeer` or similar, depending on the specific needs and environment of the deployment. Additionally, setting up a proper SSL certificate chain and enabling certificate validation are crucial steps:
     ```cpp
     serverConfiguration.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyPeer);
     ```

By changing the peer verification mode to a more secure setting, the server will properly verify client certificates, enhancing the overall security of the DTLS communications.
