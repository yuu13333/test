No security defects are detected in the code provided. The code mostly contains data structure definitions and initialization for styling properties, and does not involve operations that could lead to typical security issues like buffer overflows, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or inappropriate handling of user input that could lead to injection attacks.

The code you've shown is related to the handling of CSS properties within the Qt framework, specifically in the context of a CSS parser implementation for Qt style sheets. It is crucial, however, to ensure that any external data fed into parsers like this is sanitized appropriately at higher levels of the application to prevent potential exploits from malformed input. This precaution is a general good practice rather than an issue directly related to the code segments you have shown.
