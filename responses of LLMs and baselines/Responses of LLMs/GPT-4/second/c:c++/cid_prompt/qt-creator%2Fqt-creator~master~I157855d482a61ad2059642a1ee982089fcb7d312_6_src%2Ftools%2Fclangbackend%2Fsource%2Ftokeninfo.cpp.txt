The provided code is an implementation of a highlighting system for a programming language in a tool like Qt Creator, involving various cursor interactions and token management within a translation unit. Upon examining the code for potential security defects related to the mentioned Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories, here are my observations:

### Detected Security Defects

1. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
   - **Line 224-225**: The method `isArgumentInCurrentOutputArgumentLocations` uses integer comparisons (`int_data`) to check if a cursor's location falls within a range. This comparison may not robustly handle all cases where the `int_data` might overflow or behave unexpectedly, especially if it's manipulated or comes from an untrusted source.
   - **Solution**: Implement safer boundary checking and consider the possibility of `int_data`
