After reviewing the provided code for potential security defects based on the CWE categories you've mentioned, here are some observations and concerns:

1. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
   - The implementation of memory management functions such as `reallocData` (lines 453 and 518) could potentially expose issues related to the improper control of the lifecycle of resources. If not correctly handled, there might be issues such as memory leaks or premature deallocation.

2. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**:
   - The usage of `qstrlen` and other string manipulation functions without strict checks for null terminators or proper length could lead to incorrect calculations that impact buffer sizes and string lengths. This is a typical concern in C/C++ environments where manual string and memory management is required.

3. **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** - Not initially listed but relevant:
