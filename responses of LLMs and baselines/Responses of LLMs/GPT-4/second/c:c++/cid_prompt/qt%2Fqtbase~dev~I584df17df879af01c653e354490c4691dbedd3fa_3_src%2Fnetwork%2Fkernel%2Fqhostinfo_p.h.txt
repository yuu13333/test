The provided code does not exhibit any of the specific security defects categorized under the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types you've asked to be reviewed for. Below is a summary of the review based on the CWE types you listed:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** - There are no explicit indications of improper access control mechanisms within the provided code snippets. The classes and methods seem to use appropriate access specifiers (public, private, etc.).

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)** - The code handles interactions between objects and threads, but there are no clear violations or improper interactions that could lead to security issues.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)** - The code responsibly handles object lifetimes, particularly with the connection of `QObject::deleteLater` in the `QHostInfoResult` constructor to clean up on application quit, which shows a proper control of resource lifetime.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)** - There are no calculations in the provided code that suggest any incorrect operations.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)** - The flow control in the methods appears standard without evidence of issues like race conditions or deadlocks within the provided snippets.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)** - The code does not show any failures in implementing or utilizing protection mechanisms. 

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)** - There are no comparisons made in the code that could be classified as incorrect or risky.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)** - The code does handle exceptional conditions, particularly with thread safety and conditional checks for object existence and state.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)** - This category often involves input/output handling which could lead to issues like SQL injection, script injection etc., none of which are applicable to the provided code since it primarily handles network information retrieval and caching without direct user input handling.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)** - The code adheres to apparent internal coding standards and best practices for Qt and C++ development, including the use of `QT_CONFIG` for compile-time configuration checks.

In conclusion, no security defects are detected in the code based on the specified CWE categories. The code generally adheres to good practices in C++ and Qt programming, focusing on network information handling and multi-threading without exposing noticeable security flaws.
