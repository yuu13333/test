The provided code is a comprehensive implementation of the `QRect` and `QRectF` classes, which are used to manage rectangular areas defined by their coordinates in the Qt framework. After carefully reviewing the code, there are no obvious security defects related to the specified CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration). The functions are well encapsulated, and there are consistent checks for conditions like nullity, emptiness, and validity of the rectangles.

The use of `noexcept` in most of the function declarations ensures that the methods do not throw exceptions, which aligns with the robust handling of operations under different conditions. Moreover, the arithmetic operations and adjustments on rectangle dimensions are properly managed to avoid potential overflows and underflows (e.g., the use of `Q_DECL_RELAXED_CONSTEXPR` for methods adjusting coordinates).

Overall, the methods and operations appear to be well-defined and adhere to safe coding standards. The code also handles interactions between entities like points, sizes, and rectangles consistently without improper access or mismanagement of resources.

Thus, based on the provided code segments, **no security defects are detected** in relation to the listed CWE categories. The code effectively maintains integrity and correctness in managing graphical rectangle objects.
