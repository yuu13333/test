The provided code, which seems to be part of a larger library handling HTTP requests and responses, does not exhibit clear security defects associated with the specific CWEs mentioned. Here is a breakdown of the areas that were particularly scrutinized, considering your list of common weakness enumerations (CWEs):

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: The code does not reveal any improper access control mechanisms directly; it primarily handles network communication details. Access control, if relevant, would typically be implemented at a higher layer.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: The code manages interactions between network elements such as connections and replies. However, there aren't any apparent mismanagements or insecure interactions that could lead to unintended behavior as per the provided snippet.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: Resource management in the code includes proper cleanup in destructors and handling of network states, without any obvious mismanagement issues like memory leaks or dangling pointers in the parts of the code provided.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: There are numerous calculations related to handling HTTP protocols, such as calculating content length or managing buffer sizes. None of these calculations appear to be incorrect or mishandled based on the code provided.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: The control flow within the code, especially in terms of handling different network reply states, appears adequately managed with clear transitions and state checks.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: The code includes conditional checks for SSL and compression, which are adequately guarded by preprocessor directives, ensuring that the absence of these features does not lead to a fallback to insecure defaults.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: The comparisons within the code, such as HTTP status code checks or header comparisons, are executed in a case-insensitive manner which is appropriate for HTTP headers, suggesting proper handling.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: Exceptional conditions, especially related to network errors or state inconsistencies, are checked and handled using appropriate error codes and state changes.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: The code's context does not appear to involve inputs where neutralization (e.g., of special or SQL characters) would be applicable, as it deals mostly with data transmission and protocol handling.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The coding standard adherence cannot be fully determined from a snippet, but the given code follows typical practices for C++ network handling with Qt libraries.

Therefore, based on the available code, no security defects directly related to the specified CWEs are detected. However, a full security review would require broader context including how the functions are used, additional parts of the codebase, and the overall architecture.
