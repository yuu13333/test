After reviewing the provided code, which is a C++ class for a Qt-based output window, I have identified a potential security defect corresponding to **CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**.

### Security Defect: Improper Resource Management

#### Description:
The defect involves the destructor of the `OutputWindowPrivate` class (lines 54-58) where both the context object `outputWindowContext` is removed and then deleted. This sequence can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. Specifically, the method `ICore::removeContextObject` (line 56) is designed to remove the context object from a certain registry or context. The subsequent deletion of `outputWindowContext` (line 57) makes further use of the removed context object within other parts of the program dangerous if they access the context object after it has been deleted but before the destructor has completed execution.

#### Solution:
To ensure safe resource management and avoid use-after-free errors, it is better to check if the object is still registered or used anywhere else in the application before deleting it. One approach could be to use smart pointers (e.g., `std::shared_ptr` in C++) for managing the lifetime of shared resources like `outputWindowContext`. This would ensure that the object is only deleted once all references to it are out of scope. Alternatively, ensure that all references or uses of `outputWindowContext` are completed before entering the destructor of `OutputWindowPrivate`.

```cpp
OutputWindowPrivate::~OutputWindowPrivate()
{
    if (outputWindowContext) {
        ICore::removeContextObject(outputWindowContext);
        delete outputWindowContext;
        outputWindowContext = nullptr;  // Nullify pointer after deletion for safety.
    }
}
```

This amendment prevents the deleted pointer from being used accidentally post-deletion, thus mitigating the risk of use-after-free vulnerabilities.
