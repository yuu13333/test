After reviewing the provided code, no security defects directly related to the specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories you mentioned are detected in the code. The code mainly involves mathematical functions and preprocessor directives to manage inclusion and definitions of mathematical constants and functions. Here's a brief analysis with respect to the mentioned CWEs:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: The code does not involve access control mechanisms.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: The code doesn't interact with external entities in a manner that involves data exchange or control flow that could lead to vulnerabilities.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: There is no manipulation of resources like file handles or network sockets that would be improperly controlled.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: The mathematical functions appear to be implemented correctly or use standard library functions. There's no evident incorrect calculation.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: The control flow in the code is straightforward, involving mainly function definitions and macro expansions.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: The code does not implement or rely on a security protection mechanism whose failure could be exploited.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: There are no incorrect comparisons. Where comparisons occur (e.g., checking processor word size), they are used to determine the appropriate computation method.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: The code lacks exception handling, but this is typical in a C/C++ header file context where exceptions are not universally applicable.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: The functions provided do not process external input in a way that requires neutralization (e.g., escaping or sanitizing data).

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The code adheres to common coding practices for C++ within the context of Qt framework development.

Therefore, the code is free from the specific security defects categorized under the CWEs you're concerned with.
