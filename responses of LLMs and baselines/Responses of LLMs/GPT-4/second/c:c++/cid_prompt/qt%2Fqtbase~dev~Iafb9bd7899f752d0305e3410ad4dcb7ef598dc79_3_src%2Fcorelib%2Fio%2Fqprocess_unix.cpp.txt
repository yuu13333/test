After reviewing the provided code, I've identified some potential security defects related to the specified CWEs:

1. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
   - The use of `qt_poll_msecs` in functions like `waitForStarted` (line 713) might lead to incorrect timeout calculations under certain conditions if the elapsed time isn't properly accounted for, leading to premature or delayed polling actions.

2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - In the function `waitForDeadChild` (line 884), `forkfd_wait` is called within a loop controlled by `EINTR_LOOP`. If the system call is interrupted, it retries without verifying that the underlying process handling logic (e.g., clean up or status checking) is still valid, potentially leading to the mishandling of process status updates.

3. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
   - The function `qt_prettyDebug` (line 53) provides a conversion to a human-readable format of binary data without adequately handling all potential non-printable characters. While it handles common control characters, the implementation might not cover all edge cases, such as null bytes, which could be utilized in data processing in ways that disrupt logic expecting fully sanitized strings.

4. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
   - The handling of the `fork()` system call and subsequent process creation and management in `startDetached` (line 927) lacks robust error handling and process state validation throughout the flow. This insufficient management could lead to scenarios where system resources are not adequately cleaned up or where the system is left in an inconsistent state after an error.

5. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
   - Error handling in `execChild` (lines 561-592), specifically the failure of `chdir`, uses `goto` for flow control, which might lead to scenarios where not all resources are adequately cleaned up, particularly in complex error states. This pattern could be improved by structured exception handling mechanisms to ensure resource integrity.

For mitigation:
- For CWE-682, ensuring accurate timeout calculations by adjusting the timeout value based on the elapsed time before each polling attempt.
- For CWE-664, adding checks after interruptions to ensure the continued validity of process-related operations.
- For CWE-707, extend the range of handled characters in `qt_prettyDebug` or explicitly document the function's limitations regarding input sanitization.
- For CWE-691 and CWE-703, refactoring the control flow to include more comprehensive error handling and state validation steps, potentially employing more modern C++ resource management techniques (like RAII) to handle system resources more safely.

These issues point to the need for careful review and testing, particularly in environments where robustness and security are critical.
