After a thorough review of the provided code, which defines and manages `QPoint` and `QPointF` classes, the following security defects were identified:

1. **CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation**
   - The multiplication and division operations on `QPoint` and `QPointF` use the `qRound` function for converting the float or double results back into integers (e.g., lines 91-93, 107). Using `qRound` might not always be the correct approach depending on the specific application's requirements because it could introduce rounding errors in some contexts. For instance, in graphics or high-precision calculations, rounding might lead to inaccurate rendering or calculations.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the rounding behavior is adequately documented and aligns with the intended precision and accuracy requirements of the application. Consider providing a way to configure the rounding behavior or use a more precise method of conversion when needed.

2. **CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**
   - The division operations (lines 107, 299, 413) use `qRound` and a divisor check via `Q_ASSERT` to ensure that the divisor is not zero. While this serves as a debug-time check, it does not provide protection in release builds where `Q_ASSERT` might be disabled.
   - **Solution**: Add proper runtime error handling for division by zero that remains active in release builds. This might include throwing an exception, returning a special value, or other error-handling strategies appropriate for the library's users.

No issues related to improper access control (CWE-284), improper interaction between multiple entities (CWE-435), improper control of a resource through its lifetime (CWE-664), insufficient control flow management (CWE-691), protection mechanism failure (CWE-693), incorrect comparison (CWE-697), improper neutralization (CWE-707), or improper adherence to coding standards (CWE-710) were detected in the code snippet. 

Overall, the primary concerns relate to precision handling and runtime checks in arithmetic operations, which should be addressed to avoid potential bugs and application crashes in consumer software using these classes.
