After reviewing the code provided, there are a couple of security defects observed that relate to the CWE categories mentioned:

### CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime

**Defect Description:**
The code has a potential resource management issue where the OpenGL context (`m_context`) and other OpenGL resources such as `m_blitter` are not consistently checked for validity before usage. This can lead to accessing uninitialized or already destroyed resources, resulting in undefined behavior or crashes.

**Code Locations:**
- **Lines 756-758:** The function `makeCurrent` is called on `m_context` without prior validation that the context has been successfully created. If `m_context` failed to create, calling `makeCurrent` could lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Lines 760-761:** The `isCreated` method is called on `m_blitter` without checking if `m_blitter` has been successfully reset or created. This might lead to operations on an invalid object.

**Solution:**
Ensure that `m_context` and `m_blitter` are valid before calling any methods on them. This could be done by checking if the `create()` method succeeded immediately after it's called and handling any failures appropriately.

### CWE-707: Improper Neutralization

**Defect Description:**
The code may suffer from improper neutralization of input before it's used in a file path or for file operations. This is a common vulnerability in cases where external input is used directly without validation or sanitation.

**Code Locations:**
- Although there are no direct file operations shown in the provided snippet that include external input, the function `cachedPixmapFromXPM` indirectly suggests that pixmap caching and retrieval mechanisms could be vulnerable to path traversal or similar attacks if not properly sanitized elsewhere.

**Solution:**
If any part of the application uses external inputs to access file paths or system resources, ensure these inputs are properly sanitized to prevent path traversal or command injection vulnerabilities. This typically involves checking and sanitizing inputs to conform to expected and safe formats.

### Observations on Other CWEs:

For the other CWE categories listed (e.g., CWE-284, CWE-435, CWE-682, CWE-691, CWE-693, CWE-697, CWE-703, CWE-710), the provided code does not exhibit explicit defects related to these without more context on how functions like `requestActivate`, `isWindowBlocked`, or OpenGL texture management are implemented internally within the Qt framework. These implementations could potentially introduce issues not visible in this snippet alone.

**Recommendation:**
Review the implementation details and error handling around the mentioned functions and resource management patterns, and ensure consistent validation and error checking to mitigate potential security risks.
