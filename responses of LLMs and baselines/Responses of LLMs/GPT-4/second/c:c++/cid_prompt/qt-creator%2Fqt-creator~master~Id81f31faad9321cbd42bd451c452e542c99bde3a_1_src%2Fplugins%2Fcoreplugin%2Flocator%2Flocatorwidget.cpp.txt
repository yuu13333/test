After reviewing the provided code, I found no security defects related to the listed Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). The code primarily involves UI component interactions and event handling for a widget in a software development environment. It follows common practices for managing UI elements, event filtering, and asynchronous tasks without clear indications of security vulnerabilities like improper access control, improper interaction between multiple entities, or incorrect comparison issues.

It's important to keep in mind that without the context of how these components interact with the rest of the system or external systems, and without visibility into the implementation details of methods used from external libraries, a comprehensive security assessment is limited. However, from the given information and the code's scope, no security defects are detected in the code.
