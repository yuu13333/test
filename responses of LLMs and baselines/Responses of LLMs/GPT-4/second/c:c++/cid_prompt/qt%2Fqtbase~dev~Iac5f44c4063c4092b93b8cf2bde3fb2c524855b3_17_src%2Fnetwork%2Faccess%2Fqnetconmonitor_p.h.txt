The code you provided primarily consists of declarations for classes related to network monitoring within a Qt application. Based on the information available in the code, here's an assessment regarding potential security defects:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: No specific instances of improper access control are visible within the code provided. Access controls would typically manifest in the implementation rather than the declaration of methods and classes.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: There's no evidence in the provided code snippet to suggest improper interactions between multiple entities. The methods and signals appear standard for network monitoring purposes.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: The code snippet does not provide enough detail to evaluate the control of resources through their lifetime as it primarily contains declarations and no implementation details.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: The code does not contain any calculations, so this category is not applicable.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: The structure and declarations in the code do not reveal issues related to control flow management.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: The snippet does not reveal details on any protection mechanisms or their potential failures.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: There are no comparisons made in the provided code that could be evaluated for correctness.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: The code lacks any explicit exception handling or checks, which is typical for class declarations. It's essential to review the implementation to assess this further.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: The snippet does not involve data input handling or operations that would require neutralization techniques.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The code follows typical conventions for Qt and C++ development, including proper usage of the `Q_DECLARE_PRIVATE` and `Q_DISABLE_COPY_MOVE` macros to handle private data and disable unwanted copy/move operations. Thus, no adherence issues are visible.

In summary, **no security defects are detected in the code based on the criteria provided**. The code seems to be well-structured for class declarations within the Qt framework. However, it is important to review the actual implementation of these methods to ensure they handle data safely, manage resources correctly, and implement robust error handling.
