After reviewing the provided code, here are the security defects identified along with their CWE classification:

1. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
   - **Lines 99-111**: This segment deals with exception handling within a thread execution context. The problem arises because it rethrows exceptions caught from worker threads without any specific handling or cleanup, which could lead to resource leaks or incomplete state if resources are not adequately managed before rethrowing.
   - **Potential Solution**: Implement thorough cleanup and state management before rethrowing exceptions or consider custom exception types that carry state information to handle them more appropriately.

2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
   - **Lines 110-112**: There is potential for resource leaks if `delete r;` is executed without ensuring that all resources in `r` are properly released or managed. Since `r` is a `QRunnable` pointer that could have a complex object graph, simply deleting it might not suffice for proper cleanup.
   - **Potential Solution**: Ensure `QRunnable` objects manage their resources correctly, possibly using smart pointers or implementing a cleanup method that is called before deletion.

3. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**:
   - **Lines 139-141**: There is an improper check after waiting for a condition variable (`runnableReady.wait(...)`). The code increments `manager->activeThreads` without ensuring that the thread is actually needed or should be active. This could lead to inaccuracies in the management of active threads, particularly under race conditions or spurious wakeups.
   - **Potential Solution**: Verify the state of the thread pool and the necessity of activating another thread after the wait condition resolves and before incrementing the active thread counter.

4. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**:
   - **Lines 355-360**: Describes the ABA problem, where the deletion and subsequent reallocation of memory for a `QRunnable` might lead to the wrong object being removed from the queue. This issue occurs because the system does not properly neutralize or handle the identifiers of runnables that might be reused.
   - **Potential Solution**: Implement a robust mechanism to track and verify the uniqueness of runnables, perhaps by using unique identifiers or reference counting, rather than relying on pointer values alone.

5. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)** and **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**:
   - **Lines 338-341**: Deleting a `QRunnable` (`r`) outside of a locked mutex can lead to race conditions where the state of `r` is modified by another thread. This could lead to double deletion or accessing a dangling pointer.
   - **Potential Solution**: Ensure all operations related to resource deletion are adequately synchronized or consider deferring deletion to a safe point where race conditions are unlikely.

Each defect pertains to crucial aspects of resource management and thread synchronization, which are critical for ensuring the stability and security of multi-threaded applications.
