Upon reviewing the code provided, several security defects were identified, specifically related to CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) and CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions). Here are the details:

1. **Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime (CWE-664)**:
   - **Memory Allocation Without Deallocation (lines 270-271)**: The code allocates memory for `pattern` and `reversePattern` using `malloc`, but there is no corresponding `free` observed in the code for these memory allocations. This can lead to memory leaks if the memory is not properly released when no longer needed.
   
   **Solution**: Ensure that the allocated memory for `pattern` and `reversePattern` is properly freed when they are no longer needed or before the object containing them is destroyed.

2. **Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-703)**:
   - **No Handling of `malloc` Failure (lines 270-271)**: The memory allocation with `malloc` is not checked for failure (i.e., it does not check if `malloc` returns `nullptr`). This can lead to dereferencing a null pointer if the memory allocation fails, resulting in crashes or other undefined behaviors.
   
   **Solution**: Add checks after each `malloc` call to ensure the pointer is not `nullptr`. If it is, handle the error appropriately, perhaps by cleaning up and terminating the operation or by using an alternative memory allocation strategy.

Addressing these issues will enhance the stability and security of the code by preventing potential memory leaks and ensuring robust error handling.
