After reviewing the provided code for potential security defects related to the specified CWE categories, here are the observations and recommendations:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - The function `emrunCommand` constructs a command line to run an application (line 43). This function pulls executable paths and parameters from potentially modifiable project and build configurations without apparent restriction or validation. This could potentially allow a user to inject malicious paths or commands if the project settings are compromised. To mitigate this, implement validation checks on the paths and parameters extracted from configurations.

2. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
   - Similar to the above, the function `emrunCommand` uses input directly from the build configuration and user inputs to form a command line (lines 49-55). This includes appending file paths and parameters which could be manipulated. Special characters in file names or browser paths might not be handled correctly, leading to command injection vulnerabilities. It's essential to sanitize and escape these inputs properly before constructing the command line.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - In `EmrunRunWorker`, a new `PortsGatherer` instance is created and stored in `m_portsGatherer` (lines 94-110). There is no explicit management of the lifecycle of this object regarding its creation and destruction, potentially leading to resource leaks if not handled properly elsewhere in the codebase. To address this, ensure that resources are managed consistently, possibly using smart pointers or similar mechanisms in C++ to handle object lifetimes automatically.

These points primarily concern potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited if additional context or misuse scenarios are considered. Proper handling and validation of external inputs and careful management of resources are critical to avoiding these common security pitfalls.
