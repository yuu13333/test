The provided code does not contain any security defects related to the specific CWEs (Common Weakness Enumerations) that you've mentioned. The code mainly deals with file and filesystem operations, managing permissions, and handling of metadata, with appropriate checks and error handling consistently applied throughout. Here's a brief analysis based on the mentioned CWE categories:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: The code properly checks permissions before performing operations, particularly in functions like `setPermissions` and when confirming the existence of files or directories. It doesn't exhibit improper access control.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: There are no evident interactions between multiple entities that could lead to security issues.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: Resources such as file descriptors are properly managed using structures like `FileDescriptorCloser` to ensure that file descriptors are closed after use.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: There are no mathematical calculations related to security aspects that could be incorrectly implemented.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: The control flow, especially around error handling and conditional checks, is adequately managed with assertions and error checks.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: The code does not show any signs of protection mechanism failure; it implements various checks and conditions to safeguard file operations.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: The comparisons, particularly those involving file permissions and metadata flags, are correctly implemented.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: The code adequately checks for exceptional conditions, such as the existence of files or permissions, and reacts appropriately.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: This category mainly deals with issues like SQL injection or command injection, which are not applicable in this context.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: The code adheres to coding standards, particularly in terms of syntax, semantic structure, and use of language features, and there's no evidence of deviation that could lead to security issues.

Overall, the provided code is well-structured with appropriate security measures for the operations it performs. No security defects are detected in the code regarding the specified CWEs.
