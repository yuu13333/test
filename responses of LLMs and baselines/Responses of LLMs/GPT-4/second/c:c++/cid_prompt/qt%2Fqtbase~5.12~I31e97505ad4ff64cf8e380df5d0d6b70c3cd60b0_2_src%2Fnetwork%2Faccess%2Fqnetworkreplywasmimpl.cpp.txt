After reviewing the provided code, there are no apparent security defects related to the specific CWE categories you listed (CWE-284, CWE-435, CWE-664, etc.). The code primarily deals with the network communication specifics for Qt-based applications using WebAssembly, focusing on handling network requests, responses, error handling, and progress updates.

However, there are several general observations and areas that could potentially lead to issues, though not directly categorized under the mentioned CWEs:

1. **Resource Management (Potential CWE-664):** The code utilizes multiple reinterpret casts and direct memory management operations, such as managing byte arrays and buffers (lines 170, 173, 175). These operations must ensure that the resources are correctly handled throughout their lifecycle to prevent memory leaks or buffer overflows.

2. **Error Handling (Potential CWE-703):** The error handling primarily relies on checking the HTTP status codes (lines 104-105, 130-131). It is crucial that these checks are comprehensive and that there are fallback mechanisms if unexpected or undefined status codes are encountered, which could be refined to better manage unusual or erroneous network conditions.

3. **Data Handling (General Security Practice):** The method of reading and processing incoming data (lines 255-271, 509-551) should ensure that there is no opportunity for data corruption or improper handling, which could potentially lead to issues like data leakage or incorrect data processing.

4. **Use of External Libraries (General Security Practice):** The code interacts with external JavaScript libraries and WebAssembly components (lines 40-51, 52-54). It is essential to ensure that these libraries are up-to-date and have been checked for vulnerabilities, as they could potentially introduce security risks if compromised.

While these observations do not directly fall under the specific CWE categories mentioned, they represent good security practices and areas where attention should be paid to mitigate potential risks in a production environment. Additionally, the use of assertions (e.g., `Q_ASSERT`) for error handling (lines 66, 87, 102, 148, 161, 309) is typically discouraged in production code as it may lead to crashes if the assertion fails. It's better to handle such conditions more gracefully.
