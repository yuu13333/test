The provided code, implementing a DTLS server using Qt, shows a potential security defect related to CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) which is not in the initial list, but relevant nonetheless, given the context of secure connections.

### Identified Security Issue:
In the constructor of the `DtlsServer` class, the following line is problematic:
```cpp
94     serverConfiguration.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyNone);
```
This line of code (line 95) sets the peer verification mode to `VerifyNone`, meaning that the server does not verify the authenticity of the SSL/TLS certificates presented by the client during the SSL/TLS handshake. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker can impersonate a legitimate client without being detected.

### Recommendation:
To rectify this security issue, the server configuration should enforce certificate verification unless there is a specific, controlled scenario where such verification is intentionally omitted (e.g., for a closed, secure network or for testing purposes with known clients). Typically, the server should use `QSslSocket::VerifyPeer` or a similarly strict mode to ensure that the clients are verified properly:
```cpp
serverConfiguration.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyPeer);
```
This change ensures that the server checks the client's certificates against known Certificate Authorities (CAs), enhancing the security of the communications.

### Conclusion:
Although the initial list of CWEs did not include certificate verification issues, the above adjustment addresses a significant security risk in the context of secure communications facilitated by DTLS/TLS, aligning with best practices for network security.
