Upon reviewing the provided code, I identified a few security issues related to improper handling of command execution and process management, corresponding to CWE entries:

1. **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**
   - **Location**: Lines 101-111 and Lines 119-166.
   - **Description**: The functions `sdkManagerCommand` allow for command execution using external input (`args` parameter), which may potentially include special or control characters manipulated by an attacker. Since the arguments (`args`) are directly passed to a process execution function without any clear sanitization or validation, this can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the `args` parameter is properly sanitized to escape or remove special characters that could be interpreted in a harmful way by the shell. Alternatively, use parameterized APIs or safe system calls that prevent command injection by treating input parameters as data rather than executable code.

2. **CWE-200: Information Exposure**
   - **Location**: Line 145.
   - **Description**: The `output.commandOutput` variable is populated with the standard output of a command execution, which may include sensitive information depending on what the `sdkmanger` command outputs. This can be problematic if this output is logged, displayed, or transmitted in a manner accessible to unauthorized actors.
   - **Solution**: Implement strict output handling policies to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed. This could involve masking or omitting sensitive details from the output before it is used or stored.

3. **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')**
   - **Location**: Lines 125-165.
   - **Description**: The function `sdkManagerCommand` uses a `QProcess` to execute potentially long-running operations without adequate controls against excessive consumption of system resources. For instance, an attacker could provide inputs or trigger conditions that cause the command to run indefinitely or excessively long, consuming CPU and memory resources.
   - **Solution**: Implement additional controls and checks to limit the amount of system resources that can be consumed by these processes. This could include setting stricter timeout values, monitoring resource usage, and implementing rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse.

The issues above are especially critical in contexts where the application has access to system-level resources or operates in an environment where security is paramount. Proper mitigations should be applied to reduce potential vulnerabilities.
