After analyzing the provided code snippet, I did not find any explicit security defects based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. The code primarily involves signal-slot connections, project updating logic, and the handling of asynchronous tasks in the context of a Qt C++ application. However, I'll highlight potential concerns that could become security-related, dependent on further context:

1. **Line 66-72 (Capture of local by reference in a lambda)**: Capturing the local variable `projectUpdateInfo` by reference in the lambda function could potentially lead to undefined behavior if the `projectUpdateInfo` object is destroyed or modified outside the lambda before it is executed. However, this is technically safe here as the lambda is executed synchronously within the function and the object remains valid. CWE potentially related could be CWE-562 (Return of Stack Variable Address), but this does not directly apply here.

2. **Line 67 (Use of external function call)**: The lambda function calls `fullProjectUpdateInfo.rppGenerator()`. If this function call results in side effects or modifications to global or static data without proper synchronization, it could lead to data races or inconsistent states. However, without knowing the implementation of `rppGenerator()`, it is hard to determine if this indeed poses a risk. Relevant CWE could be CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization).

3. **Line 95-96 (Checking for null and canceling updates)**: This portion of the code properly checks for a null pointer before proceeding, which is good practice to avoid CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference).

The code generally follows good programming practices for asynchronous operations and signal handling in Qt. The use of `QTC_ASSERT` for defensive programming (line 94) and checks before accessing results of asynchronous operations (line 106) demonstrate attention to avoiding crashes and undefined behavior.

Overall, the code appears well-structured and does not exhibit any straightforward security defects as per the CWE standards. Without more specific context, particularly on the implementation details of functions like `rppGenerator()`, it is challenging to conclusively identify security issues.
