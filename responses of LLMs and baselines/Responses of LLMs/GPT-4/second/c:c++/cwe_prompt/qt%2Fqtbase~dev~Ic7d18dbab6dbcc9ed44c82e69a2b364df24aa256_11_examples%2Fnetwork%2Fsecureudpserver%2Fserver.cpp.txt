After reviewing the provided code, one significant security defect was identified:

### Issue:
The server is configured to accept DTLS connections without verifying the peer's identity. This is evident from line 95 where the server's SSL configuration is set to `QSslSocket::VerifyNone`. This setting disables SSL certificate verification, making the server vulnerable to various types of attacks including Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), where an attacker could intercept or alter the communications between the client and the server.

### CWE Reference:
This vulnerability is associated with CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation. According to CWE, failure to validate the certificate makes the software susceptible to an attacker impersonating a trusted entity by using a forged certificate, among other attacks.

### Solution:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the server should be configured to validate the peer's certificate. This involves changing the peer verification mode from `QSslSocket::VerifyNone` to `QSslSocket::VerifyPeer` or `QSslSocket::VerifyRequired`, depending on the security requirements. Additionally, ensure the server has a proper list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) to validate the certificates against. This can be done by modifying line 95:

```cpp
serverConfiguration.setPeerVerifyMode(QSslSocket::VerifyPeer);
```
Also, appropriate error handling should be added to manage cases where certificate verification fails, ensuring that the connection is securely established or properly terminated if validation does not succeed.
