The code provided for the Android SDK downloader in Qt shows some potential security vulnerabilities and best practice concerns. Here are the issues identified using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) as a reference:

1. **Use of Insufficiently Random Values** - CWE-330:
   - **Description**: The method for generating a new filename if the desired one already exists uses a simple incremental integer (lines 145-149). This predictable naming could potentially be exploited in a race condition scenario where an attacker could guess the filename.
   - **Solution**: Use more robust and less predictable methods for generating temporary filenames, such as incorporating cryptographically secure random numbers or UUIDs.

2. **Improper Error Handling** - CWE-391:
   - **Description**: The function `extractSdk` attempts to create a directory if it does not exist (lines 111-114), but there is no error handling if the process cannot be executed correctly beyond logging the failure. This could lead to further failures not being handled properly, such as attempting to use a directory that does not exist.
   - **Solution**: Improve error handling by verifying the success of the directory creation and handling failures appropriately, possibly by aborting the operation and notifying the user.

3. **Permission Issues** - CWE-276:
   - **Description**: The method `setSdkFilesExecPermission` automatically sets execute permissions on files within the SDK without checking if these files should be executable (lines 57-68). This could potentially lead to executing malicious files if the directory contains any unintended executable files.
   - **Solution**: Include a more thorough validation to ensure that only legitimate and necessary files are given execute permissions. This could include a whitelist of expected executable file names or types.

4. **Uncontrolled Format String** - CWE-134:
   - **Description**: The logging uses `qCDebug` with format specifiers directly fed by variables (line 113), which might lead to format string vulnerabilities if the input is controlled by an attacker.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that logging statements do not allow format string vulnerabilities by properly escaping any user-controlled input or by using safer logging methods that do not interpret format specifiers.

5. **SSL Certificate Verification Issues** - CWE-295:
   - **Description**: The `sslErrors` slot simply logs SSL errors and does not seem to enforce any certificate verification (lines 47-55). This could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks if SSL errors are not properly addressed.
   - **Solution**: Modify the `sslErrors` method to handle SSL errors more strictly. This might involve aborting connections when encountering SSL certificate issues, depending on the security requirements.

6. **Download Redirection without Validation** - CWE-601:
   - **Description**: The method `downloadFinished` handles HTTP redirections but does not validate the new URL to which it is being redirected (lines 190-202). This might lead to downloading potentially malicious content from untrusted sources.
   - **Solution**: Implement URL validation after redirection to ensure that the new URL is still within a trusted domain or matches specific criteria to prevent untrusted downloads.

These vulnerabilities should be addressed to enhance the security and robustness of the Android SDK downloader implemented in this Qt application.
