The code provided does not reveal any explicit security defects as it primarily handles data assignment and retrieval for HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policies. However, it is worth highlighting a couple of potential areas where improvements could be considered, although they do not necessarily represent direct security vulnerabilities per the CWE:

1. **URL Parsing and Validation**:
    - **Potential Issue**: The method `setHost` uses `QUrl::setHost`, which might allow malformed or invalid URLs if not properly validated depending on the `QUrl::ParsingMode` used. If `QUrl::TolerantMode` is employed, it might accept URLs that are technically incorrect, which could lead to incorrect HSTS policy enforcement.
    - **Line Numbers**: 146
    - **Recommendation**: It would be prudent to ensure that the URLs are fully validated before they are set. This can be done by checking the result of `QUrl::setHost` or by adding additional URL validation logic before setting the host.

2. **Memory Management**:
    - **Potential Issue**: Although not a direct security concern, the use of raw pointers (`QHstsPolicyPrivate* d`) for managing dynamic memory can potentially lead to memory leaks or dangling pointers if not handled correctly. This is a general safety concern which could impact the reliability and stability of the software.
    - **Line Numbers**: Throughout the class `QHstsPolicy`
    - **Recommendation**: Consider using smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr` or `QScopedPointer`) to manage memory automatically. This would prevent potential memory management errors and make the code safer and easier to maintain.

In summary, while there are no explicit CWE-listed security defects detected in the provided code, it is advised to enhance URL validation and improve memory management practices. These improvements, although not directly tied to a specific CWE category, would contribute to the overall robustness and security of the code.
