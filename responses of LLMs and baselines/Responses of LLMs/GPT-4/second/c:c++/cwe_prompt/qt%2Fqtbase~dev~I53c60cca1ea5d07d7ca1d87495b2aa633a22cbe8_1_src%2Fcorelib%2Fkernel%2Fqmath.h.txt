After reviewing the code provided, a potential security vulnerability can be identified in the implementation of the `qCeil` and `qFloor` functions, specifically related to the way floating-point values are converted and manipulated:

### Security Defect

**Vulnerability**: Potential Integer Overflow
**CWE**: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Affected Lines**: Lines 73 and 85

### Description

- **qCeil Function (Line 73)**: The expression `quint64(v - INT32_MAX) + INT32_MAX` could result in an integer overflow if the value of `v` is sufficiently large. This type of manipulation risks exceeding the maximum value representable by an `int`, which is then cast back to an `int`.
  
- **qFloor Function (Line 85)**: Similarly, the expression `quint64(v - INT32_MIN) + INT32_MIN` also risks integer overflow under similar circumstances with large negative values.

These overflows occur because the code subtracts and then adds back large constants (`INT32_MAX` and `INT32_MIN`), which could lead to values that are outside the range representable by an `int`.

### Solution

To mitigate this potential vulnerability:

1. **Bounds Checking**: Implement checks to ensure that the input value `v` is within a range that is safe for the operations performed. For example, confirm that `v` does not exceed a threshold where subtracting `INT32_MAX` or adding `INT32_MIN` could cause wrapping or overflow.
2. **Type Casting**: Ensure that the types used in operations are capable of handling the range of expected values without overflow. It may be beneficial to use larger data types if necessary.
3. **Using Built-in Functions**: Leverage built-in functions that are designed to handle edge cases and extreme values more safely. For instance, the standard `ceil` and `floor` functions from the C++ `<cmath>` library are typically optimized for safety and performance across a range of compilers and architectures.

Implementing these safeguards will help ensure that the functions `qCeil` and `qFloor` handle all possible input values safely and prevent integer overflow vulnerabilities.
