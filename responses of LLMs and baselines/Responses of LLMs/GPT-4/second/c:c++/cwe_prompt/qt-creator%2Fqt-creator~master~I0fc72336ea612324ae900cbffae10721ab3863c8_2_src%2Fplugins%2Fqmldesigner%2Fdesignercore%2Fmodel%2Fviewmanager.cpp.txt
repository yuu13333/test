Upon reviewing the provided C++ code, primarily intended for managing views within a Qt Designer-like environment, I have identified a potential security defect related to improper input validation, specifically CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.

### Security Defect Description:
The code in question involves dynamically determining the `NodeInstanceView` object to be used based on command-line arguments (line 68). This object decides whether to use a capturing connection manager or a regular connection manager based on the presence of the `-capture-puppet-stream` argument in the application's command-line input.

### Issue:
Allowing command-line input to influence the behavior of the application without proper validation can lead to the execution of unexpected or security-sensitive operations if an attacker can manipulate the command-line arguments. In scenarios where an application is exposed to untrusted environments or users, this can pose a significant security risk.

### Solution:
Implement stringent validation of all command-line arguments to ensure they are within expected parameters and do not allow any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities. This might include:

- Ensuring only expected arguments are processed.
- Sanitizing input to eliminate unexpected characters or patterns.
- Using a whitelist approach, where only specifically allowed arguments trigger any changes in behavior.

This validation should be implemented before the arguments are used within the application logic, ideally as soon as the application starts and processes its command-line inputs. This helps ensure that only valid and secure operations are performed based on the input provided.
