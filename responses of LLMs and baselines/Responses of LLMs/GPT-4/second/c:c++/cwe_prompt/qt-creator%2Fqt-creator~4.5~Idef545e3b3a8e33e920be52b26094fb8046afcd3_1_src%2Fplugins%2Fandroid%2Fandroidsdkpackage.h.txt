The provided code appears to be well-structured and follows standard conventions for a Qt C++ class hierarchy. However, upon a detailed review focusing on potential security defects from a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) perspective, a potential security issue can be highlighted:

### CWE-374: Passing Mutable Objects to an Untrusted Method
- **Location**: Line 85
- **Issue**: The method `setInstalledLocation(const Utils::FileName &path)` uses a reference to a mutable object `Utils::FileName`. The problem with passing mutable objects as parameters is that the method receiving the object could potentially modify it, which can be especially problematic if `Utils::FileName` contains data that should not be altered by external code, or if the original object is shared among multiple threads or components.
- **Resolution**: If the `Utils::FileName` class or the method does not specifically require the ability to modify the passed object, passing a constant reference (e.g., `const Utils::FileName &path`) or by value might prevent unwanted side effects. If modifications are expected, ensuring that this behavior is safe and well-documented is essential.

Though the issue detected isn't necessarily a direct vulnerability in most contexts, it can lead to unintended behavior or security issues if `Utils::FileName` objects are shared among various parts of the application without proper synchronization or safety checks. Adjusting this aspect can help solidify the application's overall robustness and security posture.

Overall, no other immediate security defects are detected in the code. The potential issue discussed above should be addressed depending on the specific use case and architecture of the overall application.
