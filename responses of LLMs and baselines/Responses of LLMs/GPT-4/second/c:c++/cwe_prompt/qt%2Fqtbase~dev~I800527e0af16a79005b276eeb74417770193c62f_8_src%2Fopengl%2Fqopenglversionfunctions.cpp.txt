After thoroughly reviewing the provided code for security defects based on the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards, I have identified a security defect associated with the use of potentially unsafe dynamic memory management, specifically:

1. **Improper Cleanup on Thrown Exception (CWE-460)**

In the `QOpenGLContextVersionData::forContext` function (line 69), there is a memory allocation (`new QOpenGLContextVersionData;` on line 73) which is followed by a signal-slot connection (line 77). If the `QObject::connect` call fails and throws an exception, the newly created `data` object would not be deleted, leading to a memory leak.

**Solution**: To handle this, you should ensure that memory allocated is properly managed and deallocated even in the case of an exception. This can be achieved by using smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` in C++ which automatically deallocate memory when the owning object goes out of scope. Modify the code by wrapping the `data` pointer with `std::unique_ptr` and release it after successful connection or handle it in a catch block if exceptions are expected.

Here's how you can refactor the code snippet to handle the exception scenario properly:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<QOpenGLContextVersionData> data(new QOpenGLContextVersionData);
QObject::connect(context, &QObject::destroyed, context, [data = data.get()](){ delete data; }, Qt::DirectConnection);
contextData[context] = data.release();
```

This refactoring uses `std::unique_ptr` for automatic memory management. The `data.get()` method is used to pass the raw pointer to the lambda, and `data.release()` is used to release ownership of the pointer once it's safely stored and connected, preventing double deletion.
