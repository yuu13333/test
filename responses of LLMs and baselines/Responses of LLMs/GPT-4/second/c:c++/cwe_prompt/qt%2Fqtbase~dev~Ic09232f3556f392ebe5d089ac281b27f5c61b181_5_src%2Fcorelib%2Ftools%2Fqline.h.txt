No security defects are detected in the code.

The code provided is a header file defining classes for 2D line geometry, specifically `QLine` and `QLineF`, within the Qt framework. It includes method definitions for basic geometric operations such as translations, setters for points, and equality checks. There are no operations involving untrusted input, external file handling, network communications, or other typical sources of vulnerabilities. The use of `constexpr` and `inline` ensures that these methods are evaluated at compile time whenever possible, limiting the potential for runtime errors.

All operations and transformations are confined to the properties of lines and points, involving no external mutable state or system-level operations that could introduce vulnerabilities. Thus, the code primarily deals with internal state changes within the bounds of the objects it manipulates.

The code seems well-encapsulated with private member variables and does not expose sensitive data. There are no signs of buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other common security issues directly associated with the functions defined here. The usage of Qt's own types (like `QPoint` and `QPointF`) and methods (`translate`, `setLine`, etc.) suggests reliance on Qt's well-tested internal libraries, which are out of scope for this review but generally trusted to handle data safely and efficiently.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the snippet and the nature of the operations within the classes, no specific Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) related vulnerabilities are detected.
