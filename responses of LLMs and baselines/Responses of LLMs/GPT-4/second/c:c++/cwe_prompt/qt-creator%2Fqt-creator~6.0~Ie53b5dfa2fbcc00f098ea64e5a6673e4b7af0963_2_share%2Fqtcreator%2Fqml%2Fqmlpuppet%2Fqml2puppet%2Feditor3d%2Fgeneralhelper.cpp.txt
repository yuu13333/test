After reviewing the provided code snippet, here are the security defects identified, categorized by CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration):

1. **CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference**
   - **Lines: 587-589** - The method `isMacOS()` uses a conditional compilation directive to return a boolean value. However, the use of `#ifdef` could result in undefined behavior or null pointer dereferences if not handled correctly elsewhere in environments not defined as `Q_OS_MACOS`.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that all possible operating system conditions are accounted for, or provide a default case to handle other environments safely.

2. **CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**
   - **Lines: 361-381** - The method `storeToolState` modifies shared resources (`m_toolStatesPending` and `m_toolStates`) which can be accessed concurrently by multiple threads without proper synchronization mechanisms.
   - **Solution**: Use mutexes or other synchronization techniques to protect the access and modification of shared resources.

3. **CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')**
   - **Lines: 610-623** - The method `eventFilter` dynamically casts the `QObject` to `QQuick3DNode`. If `obj` is not of type `QQuick3DNode`, this could lead to type confusion issues.
   - **Solution**: Validate the result of `qobject_cast` before using it. If the cast fails (i.e., returns nullptr), handle the error appropriately.

These issues need careful handling to ensure the robustness and security of the software. Adding explicit checks, handling all potential conditions, and using synchronization where needed are essential steps to mitigate these risks.
