The provided code snippet primarily consists of a class definition within C++ and does not contain enough functional details to evaluate for specific security weaknesses related to code execution. The code outlines the structure of a class and its member declarations without including method implementations or any direct data handling processes. Hence, it's challenging to identify security vulnerabilities based on this snippet alone, as it lacks context on how data is processed or manipulated.

**No security defects are detected in the code** based on the current provided code, as there are no operations or manipulations detailed that could be evaluated against CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards.

To effectively review this code snippet for security defects, it would be necessary to examine the implementations of the methods, particularly how the class handles input, manages memory, and interacts with other system components. Security reviews are most effective when the actual logic, data handling, and interaction with external systems or APIs are visible.
