No security defects are detected in the code.

The code provided primarily focuses on a custom data structure implementation used within the Qt framework, leveraging either a `QSet` or a polymorphic memory resource (`std::pmr::unordered_set`) depending on the availability of C++17 library features. It handles memory and hashing securely, employing system-specific optimizations and practices suitable for a generic container.

It carefully handles potential issues with memory and hash calculations, ensuring the application does not suffer from hash collision vulnerabilities or inefficient memory usage, thus avoiding problems like CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-915 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes).

Moreover, it uses `constexpr` functions and conditions to ensure compile-time evaluation where possible, which also contributes to safer and more predictable runtime behavior.

The code appears to handle edge cases and potential fallback scenarios (like ensuring a minimum bucket list size through a prime number sequence), thereby maintaining stability and performance. Furthermore, `Q_DISABLE_COPY_MOVE` is utilized to prevent unintended copy or move operations, adhering to best practices in modern C++ for managing resources within custom types (which mitigates issues related to CWE-401: Memory Leak). This approach ensures that the container does not inadvertently perform operations that could lead to resource leaks or invalid state.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, it adheres well to secure coding standards.
