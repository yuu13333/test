The provided code contains a security vulnerability related to the handling of data received over a network, specifically a form of CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (also known as a Denial of Service vulnerability). Here are the details:

**Vulnerability Description:**
The `QLocalSocket` class instances in the code are set to read and immediately write back the same amount of data they receive from clients without any form of rate limiting or checks on the size of incoming data. This lack of validation can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition where a malicious client sends large amounts of data to the server, which the server attempts to process all at once, potentially exhausting system resources (memory and CPU).

**Affected Lines:**
- Lines 68-69: In the `ServerThread`'s `run` method, `socket->read` and `socket->write` are called with the size of the data available (`bytesAvailable`), which is directly controlled by the client.
- Lines 104-110: Similarly, in the `SocketFactory` class, there is a call to `socket->read` and `socket->write` using `bytesAvailable`, without checks on the size of the data.

**Solution:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing the following security measures:
1. **Rate Limiting:** Implement a mechanism to control the rate of data that a client can send to prevent resource exhaustion.
2. **Input Validation:** Add checks to ensure that the size of incoming data is within expected limits. This could involve setting a maximum buffer size and rejecting or truncating data that exceeds this size.
3. **Resource Management:** Implement timeouts and more robust error handling around socket operations to manage resource utilization more effectively, including closing connections that appear to be abusive or malfunctioning.

By addressing these points, the application will be more resistant to DoS attacks and better manage its resource utilization under high load conditions.
