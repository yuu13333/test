After analyzing the provided code, I found several potential security concerns related to the command injection and unsafe handling of external input. Here are the details:

1. **Command Injection (CWE-77)**:
   - **Location**: Line 100-102.
   - **Description**: The function `emrunCommand` constructs a command line for executing a Python script with parameters that include user-controllable input such as the browser type and a port number. The function directly appends the browser type and port number to the command line without proper sanitization or escaping. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject additional command line parameters or commands if they can control the input, particularly through the browser type.
   - **Solution**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs used in command line operations. Ensure that inputs that will be used as part of commands are strictly alphanumeric or match a specific allowed pattern using regular expressions. Alternatively, use parameterized APIs that can handle command line parameters securely.

2. **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-259)**:
   - **Location**: Implicit at lines 50-54.
   - **Description**: The `emrunCommand` function uses the `--no_emrun_detect` flag, which is a default setting that could potentially disable security features of the `emrun` tool designed to detect misuse. While not directly related to hard-coded credentials, this kind of hardcoded configuration can lead to insecure defaults that might be exploited.
   - **Solution**: Avoid using hardcoded flags or settings that disable security features. Instead, configure these through user settings or environment configurations that can be securely managed.

These issues are based on the code snippet provided and the context in which inputs are handled. It's essential to review these areas closely and apply secure coding practices, especially when dealing with external input and command execution.
