After reviewing the provided code, no security defects are detected in the code according to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. The code consists primarily of declarations and structure setups for various dialog helpers in a Qt environment, including color, font, file, and message dialogs. There are no operations involving direct memory management, unsafe input handling, or network operations that could typically lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injections, or remote code execution.

The main actions taken by the code involve setting up enums, classes, and method prototypes for handling dialog options and configurations. Since these are primarily declarations and straightforward method definitions without implementing risky operations, there are no apparent security flaws.

No security defects are detected in the code.
