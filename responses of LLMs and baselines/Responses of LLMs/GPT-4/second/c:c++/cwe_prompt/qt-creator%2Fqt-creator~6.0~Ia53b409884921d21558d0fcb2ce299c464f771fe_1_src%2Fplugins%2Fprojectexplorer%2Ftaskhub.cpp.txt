No security defects are detected in the code based on the provided excerpt and a review against the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. The code appears to be primarily focused on task management functionality within a development environment, with functions to add, update, and display tasks, but does not include operations typically associated with higher security risks such as handling sensitive data, executing external commands, or network operations. Additionally, the code uses assertions to enforce state conditions and check preconditions which is a good practice to prevent unexpected behavior in software applications.
