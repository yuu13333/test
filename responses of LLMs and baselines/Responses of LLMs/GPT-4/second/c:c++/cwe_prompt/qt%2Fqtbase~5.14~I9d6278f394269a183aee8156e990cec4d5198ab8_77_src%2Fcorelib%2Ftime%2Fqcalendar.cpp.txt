After reviewing the provided code, one potential security issue stands out related to the handling of global static storage, specifically the `QMap<QString, QCalendarBackend *> QCalendarBackend::s_calendars;` declaration (line 39). Here are the details:

### Issue Identified
- **Concurrency Issue with Global Static Storage**: The code utilizes a global static `QMap` to store instances of `QCalendarBackend`. This global map is accessed and modified without any form of synchronization mechanism to handle concurrent access from multiple threads. This could lead to race conditions, where multiple threads access and modify the map concurrently, potentially leading to data corruption or unpredictable behavior.

### CWE Reference
- The issue corresponds to **CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**.

### Affected Lines
- **Declaration**: Line 39 `QMap<QString, QCalendarBackend *> QCalendarBackend::s_calendars;`
- **Access and Modification**: Lines 89-96 (destructor), 454-462 (registering a calendar), 480-484, 493-496 (lookup operations).

### Suggested Solution
To address this potential concurrency issue, consider implementing thread-safety mechanisms for accessing and modifying the global static `QMap`. Possible solutions include:
1. **Mutex Locks**: Introduce mutex locks to synchronize access to the `s_calendars` map. Lock the mutex before accessing or modifying the map and unlock it afterward.
2. **QMutex or QReadWriteLock**: Qt provides `QMutex` and `QReadWriteLock` for handling thread synchronization. `QReadWriteLock` could be particularly beneficial as it allows multiple read accesses concurrently but ensures exclusive access for write operations.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might modify the registration and deregistration methods to use `QMutex`:

```cpp
QMutex mutex;

bool QCalendarBackend::registerCalendar(const QString &name) {
    QMutexLocker locker(&mutex);  // Locks mutex upon construction and releases upon destruction
    if (s_calendars.contains(name)) {
        qDebug() << "Calendar name" << name << "is already taken";
        return false;
    }
    s_calendars.insert(name, this);
    return true;
}

QCalendarBackend::~QCalendarBackend() {
    QMutexLocker locker(&mutex);
    auto dead = std::remove_if(s_calendars.begin(), s_calendars.end(),
                        [this] (QCalendarBackend *it) -> bool {
                            return it == this;
                        });
    while (dead != s_calendars.end())
        dead = s_calendars.erase(dead);
}
```

This solution ensures that any thread trying to register or deregister calendars must first acquire the mutex, thus preventing concurrent access and modification issues.
