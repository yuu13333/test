After reviewing the provided code, I identified several potential security issues aligned with the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. Here are the details of each issue:

### CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
The code enables command-line arguments to be passed and processed without sufficient input validation, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary system commands. This is particularly relevant in functions that handle command line parsing and execution based on environment variables and user inputs.

**Solution:** Ensure all inputs are properly sanitized and validated before they are used in command execution. Implement strict input validation routines that reject suspicious or unexpected inputs.

### CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
The code prints sensitive data directly to the console, which can be intercepted by unauthorized parties if the data is transmitted over an insecure channel or logged inappropriately.

**Solution:** Sensitive information should be handled using secure methods that encrypt data before transmission or avoid transmitting sensitive data in cleartext.

### CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
The code uses environment variables and outputs errors and other system data that might expose sensitive information to an unauthorized user, particularly through debugging or error messages.

**Solution:** Restrict the amount of information exposed through error messages and logs. Ensure that sensitive data is not included in debugging or error output unless absolutely necessary and that access to such outputs is secured.

### General Recommendations:
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows, memory corruption, and other potential exploits.
- **Regular Code Audits:** Perform regular security audits and static code analysis to detect and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
- **Security Training:** Ensure that developers are trained in security best practices and understand how to write secure code.

These issues need thorough analysis and testing to confirm their exploitability in the context of your application. Implementing the recommended solutions will help in mitigating potential risks associated with these security weaknesses.
