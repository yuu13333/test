After a thorough review of the provided code, I found a potential security issue that corresponds to CWE-367 (Time-of-check to time-of-use, or TOCTOU) in the handling of the `syncHandle` event object. Here are the details:

### Issue Description:
The code uses the `syncHandle` event object for signaling and waiting mechanisms within multiple contexts and operations (e.g., `cancelAsyncRead`, `waitForNotification`, `consumePendingAndEmit`). This event object is used to coordinate state between different parts of the system that run asynchronously. However, the time gap between checking the event's state and using the event's state could lead to a
