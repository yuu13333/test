The provided code snippet, which is part of a Qt-based application, mostly focuses on handling processes and local server interactions. Reviewing the code with an emphasis on security, particularly with reference to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards, reveals a potential security issue:

### Security Issue: Use of Hard-coded Credentials

#### Line Number:
- **76-77**: The function `launcherSocketName()` constructs a socket name using a predictable format based on the master directory path and the application's PID.

#### Description:
This part of the code constructs a socket name that could be predictable, which might allow an attacker to guess the name of the socket. By knowing or predicting the socket name, an attacker might be able to interact with the socket if other security controls do not prevent it. This could potentially lead to unauthorized actions being triggered or sensitive information being leaked.

#### CWE Reference:
This issue corresponds to **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials**, in the sense that it involves using predictable resource names (like credentials) that an attacker could exploit.

#### Recommended Solution:
To mitigate this security issue, consider generating a more unpredictable and secure socket name. This can be achieved by incorporating random or cryptographic components into the name to make it less predictable. For example, you could use a strong random number generator to include a random string in the socket name, or utilize UUIDs.

Here's an example modification to the code:
```cpp
#include <QUuid>

static QString launcherSocketName()
{
    return Utils::TemporaryDirectory::masterDirectoryPath()
           + QStringLiteral("/launcher-%1-%2").arg(QString::number(qApp->applicationPid()))
           .arg(QUuid::createUuid().toString());
}
```
This change incorporates a UUID into the socket name, significantly increasing its unpredictability and reducing the risk of an attacker successfully guessing it.
