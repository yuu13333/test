The provided code is a detailed C++ implementation of the `QRect` and `QRectF` classes, which define rectangle objects with integer and floating-point coordinates respectively. These classes are part of the Qt framework and provide methods for handling rectangle geometry, such as checking containment, adjusting dimensions, and performing geometric transformations.

Upon reviewing the code for potential security defects according to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards, no explicit security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, or integer overflows are evident in the code provided. The methods mainly deal with simple arithmetic operations on member variables that represent the rectangle's coordinates and size. Moreover, these operations are marked `noexcept`, which suggests that they are not expected to throw exceptions under normal conditions, a practice that can help in avoiding exceptions as a source of runtime errors.

However, one area that might be worth noting, although not a security defect per se in this context, relates to the handling of integer operations, particularly in methods that adjust rectangle dimensions or positions (e.g., `adjust()`, `setRect()`, etc.). There is no explicit check for overflow or underflow conditions when performing these operations. While typically not a security concern in this specific kind of software component, it's a good practice in general to consider the potential for arithmetic operations to exceed the limits of the data types being used.

Overall, based on the information available in the provided code snippet:

**Conclusion**: No security defects are detected in the code.
