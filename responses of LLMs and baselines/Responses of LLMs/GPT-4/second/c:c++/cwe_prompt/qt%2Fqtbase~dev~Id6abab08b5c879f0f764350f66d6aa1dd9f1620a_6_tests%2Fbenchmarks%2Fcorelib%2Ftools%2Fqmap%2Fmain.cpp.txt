After carefully reviewing the provided code, I've identified a potential security issue related to the implementation of the `XString` class and its usage in the `QMap` container. The issue is related to CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator.

**Security Defect: Use of Incorrect Operator (CWE-480)**

- **Description**: The `XString` class, which extends `QString`, defines an overloaded `<` operator (lines 253-257). This operator is used by `QMap` to determine the order of keys. However, the operator uses the `toInt()` function to convert the string representation to an integer for comparison. This can lead to incorrect behavior or security vulnerabilities in the following scenarios:
  - If the `XString` does not represent an integer (e.g., "abc"), the `toInt()` method returns `0` which could lead to unexpected behavior as different strings might be considered equal.
  - If the string representation leads to integer overflows or underflows during conversion, it could cause unexpected results that might be exploited for denial-of-service attacks or incorrect data processing.

- **Affected Code**:
  - The operator definition on lines 253-257.
  - The use of `XString` in the `QMap` for insertion operations (lines 259-280).

**Solution**:
- Implement more robust validation and parsing logic in the `<` operator of the `XString` class to handle non-integer strings and potential integer overflow/underflow scenarios securely.
- Consider using standard data types for keys in `QMap` that do not require complex conversions, or ensure that `XString` instances always contain valid integer-representable strings before they are used as keys.

This specific issue involves a logic flaw that can affect the performance and correctness of the program, potentially leading to security weaknesses, particularly in applications where the correctness of sorting and key management is crucial.
