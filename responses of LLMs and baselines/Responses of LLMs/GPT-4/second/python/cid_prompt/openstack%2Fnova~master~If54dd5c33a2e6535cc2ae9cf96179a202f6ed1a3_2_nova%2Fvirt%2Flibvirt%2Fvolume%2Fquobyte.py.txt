After reviewing the provided code, here are the identified security defects and their corresponding solutions:

1. **CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**
   - **Location:** Line 172
   - **Description:** The code checks for a specific exception (errno.ENOTCONN) to detect a mount that was not properly unmounted. However, other critical filesystem-related errors could occur, which are not being handled here.
   - **Solution:** Extend the exception handling to cover other potential filesystem-related errors such as `errno.EBUSY` or `errno.EIO`, and handle each appropriately based on the situation. Consider logging these errors or taking corrective actions as necessary.

2. **CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**
   - **Location:** Lines 76, 179
   - **Description:** The code assumes that if a volume is not mounted (as determined by the `is_mounted` function), it should proceed to mount it without checking whether the target directory (`mnt_base`) is already in use by another process or mount, potentially leading to resource conflicts or overwriting.
   - **Solution:** Before attempting to mount a volume, verify that the target mount point is not occupied by another resource. If it is occupied, log an appropriate error and avoid proceeding with the mount.

3. **CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management**
   - **Location:** Lines 165-178
   - **Description:** If the `os.stat` call in line 170 fails due to `errno.ENOTCONN`, the volume is unmounted, but the function continues to attempt to mount the volume immediately afterward. There's a lack of control flow management to ensure that operations like unmounting have completed successfully before reattempting a mount.
   - **Solution:** After unmounting the volume due to an unsuccessful mount, ensure that the unmount was successful before proceeding to mount the volume again. This might involve checking that the mount point is fully released or adding a delay if needed.

4. **CWE-707: Improper Neutralization**
   - **Location:** Lines 163, 189
   - **Description:** The `_normalize_export` function is used to manipulate the volume export path but does not adequately validate the input, potentially leading to incorrect file paths or misuse in certain contexts.
   - **Solution:** Enhance the `_normalize_export` function to validate that the resulting path is within expected boundaries and does not lead to directory traversal or other file system attacks.

These points address specific vulnerabilities in the code related to resource management, error handling, and input validation. It's recommended to apply these solutions to prevent potential runtime failures and security risks.
