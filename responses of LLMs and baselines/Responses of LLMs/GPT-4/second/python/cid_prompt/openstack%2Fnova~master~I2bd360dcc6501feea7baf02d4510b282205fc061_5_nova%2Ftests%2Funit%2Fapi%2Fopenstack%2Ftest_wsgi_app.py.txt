No security defects are detected in the code related to the provided CWE categories.

The code sample is generally well structured and follows good practices such as:
- Managing environment variables to control test behavior (line 36).
- Using temporary files safely with context management to ensure proper cleanup (lines 39, 48).
- Isolating configurations in tests to avoid side effects between them (line 45).
- Properly mocking external dependencies to ensure tests do not interact with real services or state (lines 51-77).

However, it's worth noting that while no direct security defects related to the listed CWE categories are detected, always ensure that the use of temporary files (like the configuration file created on line 39) adheres to security best practices, such as avoiding predictable file names and ensuring permissions are appropriately restrictive to avoid unauthorized access. This is not a direct finding from the given code but is a general recommendation for handling file operations in security-sensitive applications.
