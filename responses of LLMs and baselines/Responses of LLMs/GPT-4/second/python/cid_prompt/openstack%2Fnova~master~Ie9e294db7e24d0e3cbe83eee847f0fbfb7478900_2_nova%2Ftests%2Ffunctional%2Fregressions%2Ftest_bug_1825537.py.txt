Upon reviewing the code, it appears that there is a specific security defect related to CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions.

**Explanation:**
The defect is linked to how exceptions are handled during the resize operation, particularly when an error occurs and the system needs to revert resource provider allocations. The code in question aims to handle a failed resize operation by cleaning up resource allocations. However, the comment on lines 69-73 indicates a known bug (`bug 1825537`) where the allocations are not correctly reverted, leaving the system in an inconsistent state where the instance allocations reflect the old flavor on the source node even though the instance is neither running on the source host nor pointed at the source host in the database.

**Specific Location and Description of the Issue:**
- **Lines 69-74**: The comment `FIXME` highlights an area where the expected behavior during an exception (failure in `finish_resize`) does not occur as intended. The cleanup of the destination node's resource provider allocations fails, resulting in incorrect system state or resource leaks.

**Proposed Solution:**
To address this security issue, you need to ensure that when `finish_resize` fails, the system reliably reverts the allocations to reflect the actual state of the instance. This can involve adding an exception handling mechanism that ensures the allocation on the destination node is cleared if the migration or resize process does not complete successfully. Code to properly handle exceptions and clean up resources could look something like this:

```python
try:
    self._resize_and_assert_error(server, 'host2')
except Exception as e:
    # Log the exception here
    print(f"Error during resize: {str(e)}")
    # Attempt to revert allocations
    self.api.revert_allocations(dest_rp_uuid)
    raise
```

Additionally, proper unit testing should be performed to verify that allocations are reverted as expected under failure conditions. This may require mocking the failure conditions and asserting that the cleanup code executes correctly.
