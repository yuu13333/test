Upon reviewing the provided code, I found potential issues related to two CWE categories:

### CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
The following code sections lack proper exception handling mechanisms:

1. **Line 65:** In the `require_tenant_aggregate` function, there's a call to `objects.AggregateList.get_by_metadata(ctxt, value=request_spec.project_id)`, which fetches aggregates based on metadata. If this operation fails due to database connection issues or data inconsistency, the exception is not caught, which can lead to unhandled exceptions crashing the application.
   
   **Solution:** Wrap this database call in a try-except block and handle potential exceptions appropriately, either by logging the error, retrying the operation, or propagating the exception with additional context to the caller.

2. **Line 107:** Similar to the previous point, in `map_az_to_placement_aggregate`, there's a call to `objects.AggregateList.get_by_metadata(ctxt, key='availability_zone', value=az_hint)` without exception handling.

   **Solution:** Implement a try-except structure around the database call to manage exceptions effectively.

### CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
There are points in the code where the functions are expected to return a boolean value based on certain conditions but may continue execution without ensuring these conditions are met, potentially leading to logic errors:

1. **Line 65-89:** In the `require_tenant_aggregate` function, the logic proceeds to filter and modify the `request_spec` based on the presence of tenant-specific aggregates. However, if no aggregates are found and aggregates are required (`agg_required`), it logs a warning and raises an exception, but the function's prior checks and modifications might proceed regardless of whether it makes sense to continue.

   **Solution:** Review the control flow to ensure that the function exits early or redirects flow appropriately when aggregates are required but not found, prior to attempting any modifications on `request_spec`.

Both issues could impact the robustness and reliability of the application, and addressing them would improve error handling and control flow management, leading to a more stable and predictable system behavior.
