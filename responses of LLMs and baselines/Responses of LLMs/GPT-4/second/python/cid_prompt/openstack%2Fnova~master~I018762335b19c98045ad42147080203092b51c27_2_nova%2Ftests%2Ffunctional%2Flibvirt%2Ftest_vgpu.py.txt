Upon reviewing the provided code for security defects, I identified potential issues related to the following Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entries:

1. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
   - In line 95, the code references `self.computes[self.current_host].driver._host.get_connection()`. This access assumes that the `current_host` key always exists within the `computes` dictionary, potentially leading to a KeyError if the dictionary does not have an entry for `current_host`. This could be problematic if dynamic host assignments or changes occur during runtime without proper checks.
   - Solution: Add a check
