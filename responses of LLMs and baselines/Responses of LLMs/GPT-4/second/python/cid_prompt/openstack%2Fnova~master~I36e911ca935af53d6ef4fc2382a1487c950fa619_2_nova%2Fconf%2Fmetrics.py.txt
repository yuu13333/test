After reviewing the provided code, I identified a potential security defect corresponding to CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation). The issue is related to the handling of the configuration for the `collection_interval` option.

### Problem Detail:
In the configuration option `collection_interval` (lines 28-38), the minimum allowed value is set to `-1`. According to the provided help text, setting this value to `-1` disables the metrics collection feature. However, there is no explicit code shown that handles this special case differently in the subsequent use of this configuration setting. This can lead to incorrect behavior or calculation where the system might still attempt to use this value in scheduling tasks or calculations, effectively causing logical errors or misconfigurations.

### Potential Impact:
If the `collection_interval` is set to `-1` and used in scheduling or timer configurations without proper handling, it could result in unexpected behavior, such as attempting to schedule an event with a negative interval, which typically results in errors or undefined behavior depending on the system's handling of such values.

### Solution:
Implement explicit checks in the areas of the code where `collection_interval` is utilized. Ensure that if the value is `-1`, the system either skips the corresponding operations or handles this case appropriately, such as by not scheduling any collection tasks.

```python
def schedule_collection(conf):
    interval = conf.metrics.collection_interval
    if interval == -1:
        print("Metrics collection disabled.")
    else:
        # Schedule the metrics collection using the specified interval
        schedule.every(interval).seconds.do(collect_metrics)
```

This change ensures that when the `collection_interval` is set to disable the operation (i.e., `-1`), it is explicitly handled, thus preventing any incorrect scheduling or calculation.
