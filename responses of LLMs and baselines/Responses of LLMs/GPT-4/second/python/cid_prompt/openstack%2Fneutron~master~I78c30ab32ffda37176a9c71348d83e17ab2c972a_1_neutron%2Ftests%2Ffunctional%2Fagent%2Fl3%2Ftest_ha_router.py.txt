After reviewing the code, there do not appear to be any security defects related to the specified CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration) categories. The code primarily involves testing functions and does not expose any noticeable security vulnerabilities regarding access control, interaction between entities, resource management, calculations, control flow management, protection mechanisms, comparisons, exception handling, neutralization, or coding standards. It effectively simulates various router states and configurations, managing the lifecycle of high availability (HA) routers without evident mismanagement of system resources or controls. 

No security defects are detected in the code based on the given CWE categories.
