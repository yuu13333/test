After reviewing the provided code, a couple of security defects corresponding to CWE categories were identified. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

1. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: The way cookies are handled and parsed in lines 91-104 is potentially insecure. There's a risk of improperly neutralized input leading to issues like malformed cookies being processed. While there is an attempt to handle malformed cookies, this approach does not completely eliminate the risks associated with the handling of user input through cookies. 

   **Solution**: It's recommended to use more robust error handling and validation mechanisms for cookies. Proper sanitization and validation of all parts of the cookie should be ensured before processing.

2. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: Exception handling around the verification and processing of WebSocket messages in lines 130-139 and 164-172 might not cover all potential error conditions effectively. Specifically, while the code does handle some errors (like validation errors and general exceptions), it doesn't handle specific exceptions that could occur during network operations, potentially leading to unmanaged states when exceptions occur outside of the expected types.

   **Solution**: Implement more comprehensive error handling that includes specific exceptions that could arise during network operations, such as `socket.error` or other relevant network exceptions, to ensure all potential issues are appropriately managed.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: In lines 164-172, the resource (socket) management is conditional upon an exception occurring. If no exception occurs but the connection needs to be closed (for example, if the proxying completes successfully), the socket might not be explicitly closed, which could lead to resource leaks.

   **Solution**: Ensure that the socket is always closed properly by using a `finally` block that handles the closing of the socket regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.

These are the primary concerns with respect to the specific CWE categories mentioned. Implementing the suggested solutions would help in mitigating the identified risks.
