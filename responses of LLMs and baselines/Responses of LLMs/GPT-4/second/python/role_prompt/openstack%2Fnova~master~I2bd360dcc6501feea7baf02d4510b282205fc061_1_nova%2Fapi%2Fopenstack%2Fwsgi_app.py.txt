The code provided appears to be a part of the initialization and setup logic for an OpenStack Nova API service. Based on the provided snippet, the following security concern is detected:

### Security Concern:
**Potential Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data** (Lines 37 and 75-79): The function `_get_config_files()` constructs file paths based on the `OS_NOVA_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable, defaulting to `/etc/nova` if the variable isn't set. These paths are used to load configuration files with potentially sensitive information. While the environment variable usage itself isn't directly a vulnerability, the method and context in which these configurations are handled can lead to security risks if the configurations contain sensitive information and are not properly secured.

### Solution:
To mitigate the potential risk of exposure:
1. **Access Control**: Ensure that the permissions on the configuration directory (`/etc/nova`) and its files are correctly set so that only authorized users can read these files.
2. **Environment Variable Security**: Ensure that environment variables are not exposed to unauthorized processes or logged unintentionally.
3. **Secure Configuration Management**: Use secure means to manage and deploy configuration files, such as encrypted storage or a secure configuration management system.

### Additional Best Practice Recommendations:
- **Audit and Logging**: Ensure that attempts to access these configuration files are audited and logged to detect unauthorized access attempts.
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to the configuration files.
- **Environment Isolation**: Ensure that development, testing, and production environments are isolated from one another to prevent accidental leaks of sensitive information from one environment to another.

This review focuses primarily on potential issues and best practices for handling configuration data securely. It's important to conduct a comprehensive security audit for a deeper analysis, especially considering the entirety of the application's codebase and deployment environment.
