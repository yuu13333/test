After reviewing the provided code, which appears to be part of an OpenStack Nova server group API implementation, I identified one potential security issue related to improper authorization checks:

### Potential Security Issue

1. **Improper Authorization Checks**:
    - **Location**: Line 52 in the `_get_not_deleted` function.
    - **Description**: This function retrieves a list of instances that have not been deleted based on their UUIDs. The issue arises in the way the function uses the provided `context` without performing any checks to ensure that the caller has the appropriate permissions to view the data of the instances. This could potentially allow an authenticated user to retrieve details about instances they should not have access to by knowing or guessing their UUIDs.
    - **Solution**: Implement proper authorization checks inside the `_get_not_deleted` function to verify that the requesting user has the necessary permissions to access the information of the specified instances. This could involve checking the user's role, their association with the project to which the instances belong, or specific policies that govern access to instance data.

No other explicit security defects like SQL injections, command injections, buffer overflows, or explicit misuse of sensitive data (such as credentials) are visible in the given code snippet. The use of `nova.context` and its methods across various function calls appear to be a standard practice within the Nova framework for context and authorization management, assuming that the context handling is correctly implemented elsewhere in the system. However, the detailed analysis of the entire Nova codebase would be necessary to fully ensure that there are no additional security issues related to context handling or any other aspect of the system.
