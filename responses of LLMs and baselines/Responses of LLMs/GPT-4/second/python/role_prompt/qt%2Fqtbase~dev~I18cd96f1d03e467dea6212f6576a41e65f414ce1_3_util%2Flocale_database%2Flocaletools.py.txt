No security defects are detected in the code provided. The code implements several utility functions and classes for file handling and data manipulation, and it follows good practices such as using context managers for file operations to ensure files are closed properly. It also correctly handles exceptions to clean up temporary files in case of failures, which is crucial in avoiding leaving behind temporary files that could potentially be used for exploits if not properly handled.

Moreover, the use of the `NamedTemporaryFile` in the context manager pattern ensures that the temporary file is securely handled. The usage of `Path.rename` for atomic file operations (line 94) is also a good choice for ensuring that file operations do not leave the system in an inconsistent state. The overall structure and error handling mechanisms in place are well designed to prevent typical file handling vulnerabilities like race conditions or resource leaks.
