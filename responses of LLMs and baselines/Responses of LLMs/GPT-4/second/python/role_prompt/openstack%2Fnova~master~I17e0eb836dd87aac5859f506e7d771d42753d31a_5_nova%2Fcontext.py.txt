After carefully reviewing the provided code for the OpenStack Nova RequestContext and related utilities, here are the security assessments and concerns:

1. **Improper Token Handling (Lines 51-65):** The `_ContextAuthPlugin` class manages authentication tokens and service catalog URLs. It stores and returns the `auth_token` directly (line 58), which could potentially expose sensitive token information if not handled securely. Furthermore, the method `get_endpoint` uses this token to retrieve service endpoints. Best practice in token management involves careful handling, such as token masking or encrypting the token while in memory.

   **Solution:** To enhance security, the token should not be stored directly in class attributes or should be encrypted. Additionally, use secure token lifecycle management practices such as token expiration and rotation.

2. **Potential Exposure of Deleted Records (Lines 75-184):** The `read_deleted` attribute controls the visibility of deleted records. It is a string that directs whether to hide or display deleted records, based on the values 'no', 'yes', 'only' (lines 141-148). Improper handling or setting of this attribute could lead to unauthorized access to deleted or sensitive data.

   **Solution:** Review the logic and access controls that manage how this attribute is set and used across the application to ensure that deleted records are not inadvertently exposed. Ensure that modifications to this attribute are logged and auditable.

3. **Usage of Deprecated Library `six` (Line 30):** The code uses `six`, a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library. Continued reliance on deprecated libraries can pose long-term maintenance and security risks, as these libraries may no longer receive security updates or support.

   **Solution:** Since Python 2 has reached end-of-life, it would be beneficial to migrate all code to Python 3 and remove dependencies on `six`.

4. **Global Mutable State (Line 40, 378-396):** The `CELL_CACHE` is a global dictionary that caches database and message queue connections. Mutable global state is problematic in multi-threaded environments as it may lead to race conditions or inconsistent state across threads.

   **Solution:** Consider encapsulating this cache within a class or using thread-safe programming constructs to manage access to this global state, ensuring thread safety.

5. **Error Handling and Logging (Lines 277-282):** The method `can()` performs authorization checks and can suppress exceptions based on the `fatal` flag. However, it does not log failures or unauthorized attempts, which is critical for security auditing and monitoring.

   **Solution:** Implement comprehensive logging within exception handling blocks, particularly where authorization checks fail. This would help in identifying potential security breaches or misconfigurations promptly.

Overall, while the code does establish a robust framework for handling request contexts and permissions in Nova, the above points highlight areas where security and reliability can be enhanced.
