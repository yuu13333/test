The provided code snippet appears to be a configuration module for Nova in OpenStack, specifying metrics collection options. There are two areas in the provided code that could potentially lead to security defects:

1. **Negative Values for `collection_interval` (Line 30-31)**:
   - The `collection_interval` configuration option allows negative values. While `-1` is intended to disable the metric collection, other negative values are not explicitly handled. This could lead to undefined behavior or system instability if the timer handling the interval does not properly account for negative values.
   - **Security Impact**: Improper handling of these values could be exploited to cause service disruption.
   - **Solution**: Modify the configuration to reject all negative values except `-1`. Ensure that all negative values are checked during the processing of the timer interval.

2. **Hardcoded Default in `push_gateway` (Line 40)**:
   - The default value for `push_gateway` is set to 'localhost:9091'. This default configuration could inadvertently expose metrics to unauthorized users if the service is accessible over the network and not properly secured.
   - **Security Impact**: If Prometheus pushgateway is incorrectly exposed to a network, unauthorized access could occur, leading to potential data leakage or manipulation of metrics data.
   - **Solution**: Remove the hardcoded default and require explicit configuration by the administrator. Additionally, provide clear documentation on how to secure the pushgateway service.

Addressing these potential security defects can help ensure that the system remains stable and secure from unauthorized access and exploitation.
