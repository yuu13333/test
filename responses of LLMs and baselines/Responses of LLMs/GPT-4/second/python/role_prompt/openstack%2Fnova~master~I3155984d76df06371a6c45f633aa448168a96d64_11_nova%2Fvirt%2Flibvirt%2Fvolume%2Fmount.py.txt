Upon reviewing the provided code, I've identified a potential security issue related to how the file system mount points are managed in the `MountManager` class. The specific issue is in the way directory structures are handled, which might allow for directory traversal attacks if external inputs are not adequately sanitized.

### Security Issue:

**Directory Traversal (Path Traversal):**
- **Location:** Lines 109-136 (`mount` method)
- **Description:** This vulnerability occurs when user input is used to access files and directories on the server's file system without sufficient validation or sanitization. In the `mount` function, the `mountpoint` parameter derived from the disk's source path is used in filesystem operations like `mkdir`, `mount`, and `umount` without explicit checks against directory traversal patterns (e.g., "../"). An attacker could potentially manipulate the `mountpoint` to access or manipulate files outside of the intended directories.
- **Impact:** This could allow an attacker to mount or unmount directories they should not have access to, potentially leading to unauthorized information disclosure, data loss, or data corruption.
- **Solution:** Implement rigorous input validation for `mountpoint` and other user-controlled parameters to ensure they do not contain relative paths that could escape the intended directory tree. This can be done using regular expressions or other methods to reject inputs containing sequences like "../". Additionally, using absolute path checks to ensure the path resolves within the expected directory tree could mitigate this risk.

### Proposed Code Adjustment:
```python
import os

def secure_path(path):
    # Normalize the path to remove any relative path exploits
    normalized_path = os.path.normpath(path)
    # Implement further checks to ensure path is within an allowed directory
    if '..' in normalized_path or normalized_path.startswith('/'):
        raise ValueError("Invalid path")
    return normalized_path

# Example usage in mount:
mountpoint = secure_path(mountpoint)
```

Implementing this or a similar safeguard at each point where file paths are handled would significantly enhance the security of the system.
