Upon reviewing the provided code from the OpenStack Nova component, I identified a few potential security defects related to how passwords are handled and stored:

### 1. Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data (Lines 41-54)
The function `convert_password` breaks down a password into chunks and stores it as system metadata items. However, the password data is stored without any form of encryption or hashing. This method of storage could potentially expose the password to unauthorized access if the metadata storage is compromised.

#### Solution
Encrypt the password before storing it, or at least use a secure hashing algorithm if the password is not needed in its original form later. For example:
```python
from nova import encryption_utils

def convert_password(context, password):
    password = password or ''
    if six.PY3 and isinstance(password, bytes):
        password = password.decode('utf-8')
    
    encrypted_password = encryption_utils.encrypt(password)
    meta = {}
    for i in range(CHUNKS):
        meta['password_%d' % i] = encrypted_password[i * CHUNK_LENGTH:(i + 1) * CHUNK_LENGTH]
    return meta
```
*You would need to implement `encryption_utils.encrypt` appropriately or use an existing library.*

### 2. Improper Input Validation (Lines 67-69)
The code does a simple length check on the request content to prevent overly large requests. However, it fails to adequately sanitize the content of the request, particularly for the `req.body` that is used directly to update instance metadata.

#### Solution
Sanitize `req.body` to ensure it doesn't contain malicious content. Specifically, ensure that it is properly validated as a legitimate password string that meets the system's security requirements (e.g., length, complexity).

```python
def sanitize_input(input_data):
    # Implement sanitization rules based on the expected format
    if not isinstance(input_data, str) or not input_data.isprintable():
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    return input_data

# Usage in handle_password function
try:
    sanitized_body = sanitize_input(req.body)
except ValueError as ve:
    raise exc.HTTPBadRequest(explanation=str(ve))
```

### 3. Potential Information Disclosure (Lines 57-81)
The `handle_password` function seems to directly return the stored password metadata (`meta_data.password`) when handling a GET request. Returning passwords directly can be risky, especially over network communications.

#### Solution
Instead of directly returning passwords, the system should either not support direct retrieval of passwords, or it should do so in a secure manner, possibly using secure session tokens or similar methods.

```python
if req.method == 'GET':
    raise exc.HTTPForbidden("Direct retrieval of password is not allowed.")
```

Overall, the code needs careful handling of sensitive data such as passwords to adhere to best practices in security, including encryption, input validation, and secure data handling policies.
