After reviewing the provided code snippet, there is a notable security defect related to hard-coded credentials in a test case. Here's the detail:

### Security Defect
**Location:** Line 66  
**Problem:** The test case `test_change_paassword_policy` includes a hard-coded password `'1234pass'` used in the body of a password change request. While this is within a test context and might seem benign, hard-coded passwords are a risky practice as they can be inadvertently copied or exposed, leading to security vulnerabilities. Moreover, typographical errors like the method name `test_change_paassword_policy` (incorrectly spelled "paassword") suggest potential carelessness that could lead to other security oversights.

### Solution
**Refactor to Remove Hard-coded Values:** The password should be dynamically generated or sourced from a secure configuration management tool or environment variable. This prevents the risks associated with hard-coded values. The test case method name should also be corrected to `test_change_password_policy`.

**Example Change:**
```python
import secrets

# Example modification inside the test method
def test_change_password_policy(self, mock_password):
    generated_password = secrets.token_urlsafe(16)  # Generates a secure, random password
    rule_name = "os_compute_api:os-admin-password"
    self.common_policy_check(self.admin_authorized_contexts,
                             self.admin_unauthorized_contexts,
                             rule_name, self.controller.change_password,
                             self.req, self.instance.uuid,
                             body={'changePassword': {'adminPass': generated_password}})
```

By making these changes, the code avoids the risk associated with hard-coded credentials and improves overall security hygiene in the testing practices.
