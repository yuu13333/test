Upon reviewing the provided code snippet, several potential security defects have been identified. These are primarily related to the handling of tokens and headers, which can pose security risks if mishandled. Here's a breakdown of the identified issues:

1. **Token Transmission Over URL (Line 86):**
   - **Defect Description**: Tokens are extracted from the URL query parameters, which can be a security risk. URLs might be logged in server logs or browser history, exposing sensitive token information.
   - **Solution**: Tokens should be transmitted via headers or within the body of a POST request, rather than URL parameters. Modify the code to expect the token in the HTTP header or body for enhanced security.

2. **Logging of Potentially Sensitive Information (Lines 100-101):**
   - **Defect Description**: While the logging of a malformed cookie is noted, logging practices here might inadvertently lead to logging other headers or sensitive information when debugging is enabled. 
   - **Solution**: Ensure that logging does not capture sensitive information. Mask any potential sensitive data before logging, or use context-aware logging that adjusts the verbosity based on the sensitivity of the data.

3. **Token Validation Method (Line 108):**
   - **Defect Description**: The code proceeds to check the token without any prior validation of its format or content, relying solely on the `check_token` method of `consoleauth_rpcapi`.
   - **Solution**: Implement additional checks to verify the format and integrity of the token before passing it to `check_token`. This might include regex checks to validate the structure or cryptographic checks to ensure the token hasn't been tampered with.

4. **Improper Handling of Exception for Non-Standard Schemes (Lines 79-83):**
   - **Defect Description**: The application explicitly fails if a non-standard URL scheme is used, which is documented as a bug in Python versions less than 2.7.4. This might result in unhandled exceptions in certain environments.
   - **Solution**: Update the Python environment to a more recent version that handles these schemes correctly, or implement a more robust fallback mechanism that does not crash the application.

5. **Insecure Default Error Handling (Lines 112, 132, 135, 137):**
   - **Defect Description**: Errors such as invalid tokens or mismatched origins throw exceptions that might reveal sensitive information or lead to denial of service.
   - **Solution**: Implement standardized error handling that logs the issue internally while returning non-descriptive error messages to the user. Ensure that the application handles these errors gracefully without crashing or revealing too much information.

Here is a brief code snippet demonstrating how to enhance token transmission security (related to defect 1):

```python
# Adjusted method to receive token via headers for security
def new_websocket_client(self):
    token = self.headers.get('Authorization')
    if token:
        token = token.split().pop()  # Assuming 'Bearer <token>' format
        secret = strutils.mask_password(token)
        # Further processing with masked and validated token
```

By addressing these defects, the application can significantly enhance its security posture, particularly in how it handles sensitive data like access tokens.
