Let's begin by examining the provided code for potential security defects:

```python
def get_password_strength(password):
    strength = 0
    if len(password) >= 8:
        strength += 1
    if any(c.isdigit() for c in password):
        strength += 1
    if any(c.islower() for c in password):
        strength += 1
    if any(c.isupper() for c in password):
        strength += 1
    if any(not c.isalnum() for c in password):
        strength += 1
    return strength
```

### Security Analysis:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `get_password_strength` evaluates the strength of a password based on certain criteria: length, inclusion of digits, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and non-alphanumeric characters.

2. **Password Length Check**: The code checks if the password is at least 8 characters long. This is a basic and effective requirement for password strength.

3. **Character Type Checks**: It verifies the presence of digits, lowercase and uppercase letters, and non-alphanumeric characters. These checks promote the creation of a complex password, which is generally secure against simple brute-force attacks.

4. **Use of Generators**: The function uses generator expressions to check for character types (`any()` function with generator expressions). This approach is efficient because it stops processing as soon as it finds a match.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns an integer from 0 to 5, representing the number of criteria met by the password. This method is clear and allows for easy interpretation of password strength.

### Security Defects:
After thorough analysis, no overt security defects such as susceptibility to injection attacks, improper error handling, or exposure of sensitive information are apparent in the code.

### Conclusion:
**No security defects are detected in the code.**

The function is simple and focuses solely on checking password characteristics without performing any operations that might compromise security, such as external calls, database queries, or unsecured data handling.
