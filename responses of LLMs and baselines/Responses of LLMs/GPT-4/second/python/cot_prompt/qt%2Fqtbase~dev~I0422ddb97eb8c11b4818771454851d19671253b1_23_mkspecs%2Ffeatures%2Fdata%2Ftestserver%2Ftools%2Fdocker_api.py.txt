Upon analyzing the original Python code provided, I identified a few potential security defects related to the handling of subprocesses and file handling. Here's the detailed analysis:

### 1. Command Injection Vulnerability
The code constructs command strings using variable input and executes them through `subprocess.Popen`. This can lead to command injection if the input is not properly sanitized.

#### Affected Line:
- **Line 155**: Here, the code constructs a command for building Docker images. If the `config.image_name` is derived from untrusted input, it could be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands.

#### Solution:
Use lists to pass parameters to `Popen`, ensuring that arguments are properly separated and not executed as part of a shell command:

```python
docker_pipe = Popen(["docker", "build", "-", "--quiet", "-t", config.image_name], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
```

### 2. Potential Exposure of Sensitive Information
The use of `str_encode_hex` for encoding file contents and directly inserting them into a Dockerfile run command could expose sensitive information if the logs or Dockerfiles are not properly secured.

#### Affected Line:
- **Line 113**: The use of sensitive content directly within a Dockerfile constructed from script inputs could leak sensitive data if an attacker gains access to Docker build contexts or logs.

#### Solution:
Instead of embedding file contents directly into Dockerfile commands, consider copying files into the Docker image and managing access permissions and contents through Docker's layer security model.

```python
copy_cmd.append('COPY {src} {dst}'.format(src=copy_file.src, dst=copy_file.dst))
copy_cmd.append('RUN chmod {mode} {dst}'.format(mode=copy_file.mode, dst=copy_file.dst))
```

### 3. Improper Error Handling
Error messages from subprocesses are directly printed and may contain sensitive information, potentially leading to information disclosure if logs are not properly handled.

#### Affected Lines:
- **Lines 161**, **Line 180**: These lines print stderr directly, which might include sensitive debugging information about the Docker environment or infrastructure.

#### Solution:
Handle errors more gracefully by logging them appropriately without exposing potentially sensitive information to unauthorized users.

```python
if stderr:
    logging.error("Error during Docker operation: %s", stderr.decode())
    exit(-1)
```

### 4. Use of Deprecated or Unsafe Functions
The method `os.environ.has_key()` is deprecated and should be replaced with the `in` keyword.

#### Affected Line:
- **Line 99**: Using `has_key()` which is deprecated in Python 3.

#### Solution:
Replace with the modern Python `in` keyword:

```python
if "TESTSERVER_BIND_LOCAL" in os.environ:
```

These issues primarily revolve around secure handling of external inputs and system commands, and improving these aspects can significantly enhance the security posture of the application.
