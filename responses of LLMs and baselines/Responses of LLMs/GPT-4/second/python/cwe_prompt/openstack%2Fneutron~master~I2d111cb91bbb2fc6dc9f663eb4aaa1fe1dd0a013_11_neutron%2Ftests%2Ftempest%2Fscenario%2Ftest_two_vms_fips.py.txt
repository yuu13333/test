Upon reviewing the provided code, I identified a potential security issue related to the exposure of sensitive data, corresponding to CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information).

**Issue:**
The keypair, which includes the private key, is stored or handled insecurely in the method `create_vms`. The private key of the keypair (`self.keypair['private_key']`) is used in line 91 to instantiate an SSH client. This suggests that the private key might be stored or transmitted in cleartext within the application, which poses a significant security risk.

**Location:**
The issue occurs at line 91 of the code where the private key is utilized:
```python
server_ssh_clients.append(ssh.Client(
    fips[i]['floating_ip_address'], CONF.validation.image_ssh_user,
    pkey=self.keypair['private_key']))
```

**Solution:**
To mitigate this issue, ensure that the private key is handled securely through the use of encryption or secure storage mechanisms. Here are some recommendations:
- **Encryption:** Encrypt the private key when it is stored or before it is transmitted.
- **Secure Storage:** Use secure storage solutions like hardware security modules (HSM), secure key management services, or other secure environments.
- **Access Control:** Limit access to the private key strictly to components that need it for legitimate purposes, ensuring that access controls are in place and audited regularly.

By addressing this issue, you can better protect sensitive cryptographic material against unauthorized access and potential misuse.
