After reviewing the provided code, one potential security defect stands out related to the handling of configuration data, particularly in how the persistent memory (pmem) namespaces are managed:

### Potential Issue
**Hardcoded Sensitive Data (CWE-798):** The `fake_pmem_namespaces` variable contains sensitive data such as UUIDs in a hardcoded multi-line string (lines 39-70). While this appears to be test code (given the structure and naming conventions used, as well as the surrounding fixtures), the practice of hardcoding sensitive data, even in test environments, could lead to security vulnerabilities if this approach is mirrored in production environments. Hardcoded sensitive data can be inadvertently exposed or misused, leading to information leakage or other security issues.

### Recommended Solution
To mitigate this issue:
- **Externalize Configuration Data:** Refrain from hardcoding sensitive data directly in the source code. Instead, use external configuration files, environment variables, or secure vault solutions to manage sensitive information, even in test configurations.
- **Use Mocking Frameworks Appropriately:** Ensure that test data does not mirror real-world sensitive information closely. If UUIDs or other identifiers need to be used, ensure they are generated dynamically where possible or use clearly dummy and non-reusable identifiers.

This approach will help in maintaining security best practices and reducing potential risks, even within test scenarios.
