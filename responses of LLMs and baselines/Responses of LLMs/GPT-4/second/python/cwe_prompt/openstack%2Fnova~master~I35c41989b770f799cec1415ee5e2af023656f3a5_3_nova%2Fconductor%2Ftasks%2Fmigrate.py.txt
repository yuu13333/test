After reviewing the provided code for potential security defects against the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards, one possible area of concern is identified:

**Potential Logging of Sensitive Information (CWE-532)**

Logging sensitive information can lead to information disclosure if the logs are improperly protected or exposed. 

- **Affected Line:** The code at lines 73-78 and 103-107 logs error messages that include host and node details. While instance UUID, host, and node information might not be directly sensitive, depending on the deployment and what additional information is associated with these identifiers, these logs could potentially be used to infer system architecture or operational patterns, which should generally be controlled.

**Solution:**
To mitigate this, ensure that logs which contain potentially sensitive information are handled securely by:
1. Limiting log file access to authorized users.
2. Using secure storage and transmission methods for log files.
3. Regularly auditing log files and access logs.
4. Optionally, scrubbing or anonymizing certain details within logs that could be used to infer sensitive operational details.

Additionally, it is advisable to review all log entries and consider the sensitivity of information being logged in the context of your specific environment and threat model.
