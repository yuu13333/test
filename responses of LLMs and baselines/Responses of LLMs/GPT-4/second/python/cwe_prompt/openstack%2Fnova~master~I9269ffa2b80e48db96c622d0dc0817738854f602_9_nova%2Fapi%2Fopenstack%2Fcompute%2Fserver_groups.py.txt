Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified one potential security defect in line 103 related to insufficient authorization controls, which corresponds to CWE-285: Improper Authorization.

### Security Defect Explanation:
1. **Line 103 - Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key:**
   In the `index` method, the code checks if the `'all_projects'` parameter is present in the request and if the user is an admin. However, the presence of the `'all_projects'` parameter is directly taken from `req.GET`, which is controlled by the user. This can potentially allow a non-admin user or an admin to access data across all projects without proper constraints or additional validation, which could lead to unauthorized information disclosure or access.

### Recommendation:
To address this security issue, additional validation should be implemented to ensure that the `'all_projects'` parameter is not only checked for presence but also validated for the authority of the user to access such broad data. This could involve more stringent checks on user roles and the conditions under which such a parameter can be utilized.

**Modified Code Example:**
```python
102     project_id = context.project_id
103     if 'all_projects' in req.GET and context.is_admin:
104         if validate_admin_access(context.user_id):  # Assuming a function that validates if the user is permitted to access all projects.
105             sgs = objects.InstanceGroupList.get_all(context)
106         else:
107             raise webob.exc.HTTPForbidden(explanation="Not authorized to view all projects")
108     else:
109         sgs = objects.InstanceGroupList.get_by_project_id(
110                 context, project_id)
```

In this modification, `validate_admin_access` would be a function that further checks if the current user has the necessary permissions to view data across all projects, ensuring a more robust authorization mechanism is in place. This additional layer of validation helps prevent unauthorized access by ensuring only appropriately privileged users can use the 'all_projects' parameter effectively.
