After reviewing the provided code, I found no security defects related to CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards. The code, mostly function definitions and method calls, lacks operations typically vulnerable to common security issues such as buffer overflows, SQL injections, or improper error handling. The usage of standard libraries and internal methods appears safe, and there's appropriate error handling for the functionalities implemented.

Moreover, the code maintains good practices like using `mock.patch` for unit testing, which ensures that the unit tests do not alter global state or interact with external systems, and validation checks before performing operations. It is also evident that exceptions are being handled where necessary, such as in network address parsing and process execution.

Therefore, my assessment concludes with: **No security defects are detected in the code**.
