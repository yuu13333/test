The provided code has a few security defects related to exception handling and information leakage, mainly caused by improper handling of specific scenarios. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Improper Exception Handling and Error Message Information Leakage (Lines 89-93)**:
   - **CWE-209**: Information exposure through an error message. The error message includes details about what was expected versus what was actually read from the socket. This can expose internal state or sensitive information about the system's behavior or response patterns.
   - **Solution**: Modify the error message to generalize the error without detailing what was expected or what was read. For example, replace the current message with something less specific, like "Error reading from socket."

2. **Improper Handling of External Input (Line 102-104, 113-116)**:
   - **CWE-20**: Improper input validation. The function `_parse_version` is used to check the RFB protocol version, but the method itself could throw an error if the `version_str` format isn't as expected, which isn't handled, potentially leading to unhandled exceptions if the string slicing doesn't match expected indices.
   - **Solution**: Add error handling in `_parse_version` to manage unexpected formats and prevent the application from crashing. Also, ensure that the version string is validated before parsing.

3. **Information Leakage in Error Handling (Lines 159-166)**:
   - **CWE-215**: Information exposure through debugging information. When no suitable authentication scheme is found, the method logs and exposes detailed exception information which could be leveraged by an attacker to gain insights into the backend systems or logic.
   - **Solution**: Log only generic error information to the user, while detailed logs can be kept internally if necessary for debugging without exposing them to the user.

These issues primarily relate to how errors are handled and how much information is leaked through these errors. It's crucial to handle errors gracefully and ensure that the information leakage is minimized to avoid giving potential attackers insights into the system's internal workings.
