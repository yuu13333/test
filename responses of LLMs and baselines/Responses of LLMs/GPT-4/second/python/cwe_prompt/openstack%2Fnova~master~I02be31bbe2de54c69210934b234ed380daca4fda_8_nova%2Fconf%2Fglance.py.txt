After reviewing the provided code, I identified a potential security vulnerability concerning the handling of SSL connections to Glance API servers. This vulnerability corresponds to CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.

### Security Defect
**Line Number:** 39-46

**Description:** The option `api_insecure` in the configuration allows users to disable SSL certificate verification when connecting to Glance API servers. When this setting is enabled (`True`), it can expose the connection to various security risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks. SSL/TLS provides a mechanism for secure communication, but not verifying the server's certificate negates these security benefits.

### Solution
**Recommendation:** It is recommended to enforce certificate verification by default and provide clear documentation about the risks of disabling this verification. To mitigate this risk, the default value of the `api_insecure` should be kept as `False`, and users should be encouraged to use proper certificates even in development environments.

**Code Change:**
```python
cfg.BoolOpt('api_insecure',
    default=False,  # Ensure this remains False by default
    help="""
    Enable insecure SSL (https) requests to glance.

    This setting should only be used in environments where security is not a concern (such as testing environments),
    and with the clear understanding of the security risks involved. In production environments, ensure that SSL
    certificates are properly validated.
    """),
```

By making these changes, the code adheres more strictly to security best practices, particularly in terms of SSL/TLS communication.
