The code snippet provided primarily involves the configuration setup for metric collection and pushing to a Prometheus pushgateway. After reviewing the code in the context of security using the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a reference standard, the following issue can be identified:

**Security Defect: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**
- **Location**: Line 30
- **Description**: The configuration option `collection_interval` is allowed to be set to `-1`, which disables the metric collection as per the description in the comments. Allowing this value might be intended as a feature but can potentially be abused in a context where metrics collection is critical for monitoring and security. If an attacker can manipulate this setting, they might disable metric collection to hide malicious activity or degrade the system's performance monitoring capabilities.
- **Solution**: If disabling the metrics collection should be allowed, ensure that there are safeguards or additional authorization checks before such critical configurations can be altered. If it should not be allowed, consider removing `-1` as a valid input or adding validation logic that checks the environment mode (e.g., development, production) before applying such a setting.

This is a potential security vulnerability if the ability to disable metrics could be misused in a production environment. The rest of the code does not exhibit explicit security defects concerning the configuration and registration of options based on the snippet provided.
