Upon reviewing the provided code, there is a significant security defect related to improper handling of sensitive information, which could potentially lead to information exposure. Here are the details:

### Security Defect:
**CWE-200: Information Exposure** - The code implements a mechanism for excluding attributes based on authorization policies, but it fails to adequately hide sensitive information under specific conditions. The issue is rooted in how attributes are determined for exclusion and subsequently removed from API responses. If a user is unauthorized to view certain data, the code is designed to exclude those attributes from the response. However, the handling of the exclusion logic, particularly the list of attributes that should be stripped from the response, might be flawed or incomplete, potentially leading to sensitive information leakage if not all sensitive attributes are correctly identified and processed.

### Location and Suggested Solution:
**Line Numbers:** 229-238 in method `_get_filtered_item`, which is supposed to filter out attributes that a user is not authorized to view. The method `_exclude_attributes_by_policy` (lines 240-280) is tasked with determining which attributes should be excluded based on policy checks.

**Solution:** Ensure that all sensitive attributes are properly identified and included in the exclusion list. This involves:
1. Reviewing and updating the policy checks in `_exclude_attributes_by_policy` to cover all attributes that might contain sensitive information.
2. Ensuring that the policy definitions themselves are correctly specifying visibility constraints based on user roles and other security criteria.
3. Implementing comprehensive tests to verify that no sensitive information is leaked through API responses under any circumstances.

This thorough examination and updating of both the attribute exclusion logic and the associated authorization policies are crucial for preventing information exposure through the system.
