After reviewing the provided code, I found a potential security defect related to the use of insecure random number generation for operations that might require a higher degree of security.

### Description of the Security Defect:

**CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values** - The methods `generate_random_alphanumeric` (line 54) and `generate_random_numeric` (line 60) use Python's `random` module for generating random strings which are then used in operations like generating new elements with specific prefixes (line 66). The `random` module is not designed to be cryptographically secure, which means that the randomness provided by this module can be predictable in some cases. This can be a security risk if the random values are used in security-critical contexts such as generating tokens, passwords, or other sensitive identifiers.

### Recommendation:

To mitigate this issue, consider using the `secrets` module (introduced in Python 3.6), which is designed for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, tokens, or other secrets. For example, replace the `random.choice` in the `generate_random_alphanumeric` and `generate_random_numeric` methods with `secrets.choice`.

Here is an example of how you can modify the `generate_random_alphanumeric` method to use `secrets`:

```python
import secrets
import string

def generate_random_alphanumeric(length):
    """Creates a cryptographically secure random alphanumeric string of specified length."""
    alphabet = string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits
    return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _x in range(length))
```

Apply a similar change to the `generate_random_numeric` method. This change ensures that the randomness is suitable for security-sensitive applications, thus adhering to security best practices and mitigating the risks associated with predictable random values.
