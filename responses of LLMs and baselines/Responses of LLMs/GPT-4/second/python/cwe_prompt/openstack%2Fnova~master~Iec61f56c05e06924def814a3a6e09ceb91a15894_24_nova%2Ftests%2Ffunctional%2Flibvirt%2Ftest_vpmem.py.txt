The provided code has a potential security defect related to the use of hardcoded sensitive data, particularly UUIDs, which might lead to security risks such as information disclosure or misuse in a shared or public environment. This can be classified under CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials.

**Lines of Code**:
- Lines 45, 55, and 65 in the `setUp` method of the `VPMEMTestBase` class contain hardcoded UUIDs which are used to identify specific PMEM namespaces.

**Security Defect Detail**:
Hardcoding UUIDs in source code, especially in a publicly accessible or shared codebase, can expose sensitive data which should be unique and confidential. This may allow an attacker to predict or replicate the UUIDs used in other parts of an application or in different environments, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other security issues.

**Solution**:
To resolve this issue, consider generating these UUIDs dynamically at runtime or fetching them from a secure external source (e.g., a configuration file, environment variables, or a secure API) that is not exposed within the source code. This approach enhances the security by ensuring that sensitive data remains confidential and reduces the predictability of the data used within the application. Here is a conceptual example of generating UUIDs dynamically in Python:

```python
import uuid

def generate_uuid():
    return str(uuid.uuid4())

self.fake_pmem_namespaces = '''
    [{"dev":"namespace0.0",
    "mode":"devdax",
    "map":"mem",
    "size":4292870144,
    "uuid":"''' + generate_uuid() + '''",
    ...
```

This method should replace the hardcoded UUIDs and ensure that each time the application runs, it uses unique identifiers.
