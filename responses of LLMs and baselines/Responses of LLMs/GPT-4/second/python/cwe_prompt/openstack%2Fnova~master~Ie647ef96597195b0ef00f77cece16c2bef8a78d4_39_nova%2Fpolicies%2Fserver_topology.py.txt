The provided code snippet primarily deals with defining security policies for API endpoints in an OpenStack environment. After reviewing the code, there are no clear security defects directly related to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. The policy definitions and usage appear standard and appropriate for an OpenStack module. Here's a brief analysis:

1. **Lines 14, 15**: Import statements for `nova.policies` and `oslo_policy`. No security issues are directly associated with these imports in this context.

2. **Line 18**: Definition of a base policy name using string formatting. This is a pattern often used in OpenStack for dynamically generating policy names and does not itself introduce a security flaw.

3. **Lines 20-41**: Definition of security policies using `DocumentedRuleDefault`. Each policy is associated with a specific action and uses predefined rules (e.g., `RULE_ADMIN_OR_OWNER`, `RULE_ADMIN_API`) that control the permissions required to access certain API endpoints.

    - **Lines 22, 33**: Use of string formatting for policy names (`BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'index'` and `BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'host_info:index'`). This pattern is standard and secure as long as the string formatting arguments are controlled, which they are in this case.
  
    - **Lines 23, 34**: Usage of roles like `RULE_ADMIN_OR_OWNER` and `RULE_ADMIN_API` to specify who can access these endpoints. This is a common practice in OpenStack for defining access control and does not pose a security risk when properly configured.
  
    - **Lines 27, 38**: Both policies apply to a `GET` method on paths that include server-specific IDs. This is typical for RESTful APIs and does not introduce security issues by itself.
  
4. **Line 45-46**: Function `list_rules` that returns the defined policies. This function is straightforward and does not involve any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

Given this analysis, no security defects are detected in the code. The use of string formatting, policy rule assignment, and method definitions align with common secure programming practices in the context of OpenStack API policy management.
