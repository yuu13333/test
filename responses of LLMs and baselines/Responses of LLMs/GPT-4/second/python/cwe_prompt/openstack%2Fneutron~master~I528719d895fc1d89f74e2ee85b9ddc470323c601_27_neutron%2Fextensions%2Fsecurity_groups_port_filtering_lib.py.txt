No security defects are detected in the code.

The code snippet provided is primarily a configuration and metadata description for a software extension, specifically pertaining to security groups and port filtering in what appears to be a network or cloud-related application. It involves setting constants and metadata about the extension such as its name, description, and associated attributes, without including actual executable code that would introduce operational functionality or handle user input or data processing.

Therefore, based on the contents shown, there are no direct operations on external input, data processing, or dynamic execution paths that would typically be areas of concern for security vulnerabilities according to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards. The code strictly defines properties and metadata without implementing or interacting with underlying data in a way that could be exploited.
