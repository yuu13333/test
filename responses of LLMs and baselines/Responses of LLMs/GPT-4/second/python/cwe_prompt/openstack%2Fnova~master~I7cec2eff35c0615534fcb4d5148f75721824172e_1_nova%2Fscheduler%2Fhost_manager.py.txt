Upon reviewing the provided code for potential security defects and vulnerabilities, the code appears to be generally well-structured and utilizes several good programming practices. However, I've identified a potential security issue related to exception handling and information leakage:

### Potential Security Defect

**Issue:** Information Leakage through Error Messages
- **Location:** Lines 87-93
- **Description:** The error handling in the `set_update_time_on_success` decorator logs detailed error messages that include the host and the specific error message when an exception is raised. This can potentially expose sensitive information about the internal state or configuration of the system, which could be useful to an attacker.
- **CWE Reference:** CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message

### Suggested Solution

- **Mitigation:** Restrict the amount of detail provided in log messages that are generated during exception handling. Ensure that sensitive information is not logged or is properly sanitized before logging. This can help prevent information leakage.
- **Code Example:**
  ```python
  LOG.warning(_LW("Error during consumption from instance on host: %(host)s"),
                        {'host': self.host})
  ```

This change minimizes the detail in the log message to reduce the risk of sensitive information being exposed.

Additionally, it is important to review the entire logging strategy to ensure that sensitive information is not being inadvertently logged elsewhere in the system. Implementing more granular logging levels and ensuring that only necessary information is logged at each level can further enhance the security posture of the application.
