After reviewing the provided code, a security issue is present in the `_get_not_deleted` function:

**Security Defect:**
- **Issue:** Potential Log Injection Vulnerability
- **Location:** Line 76

The `LOG.debug` call formats strings directly from the input, which in this case includes the `cell_mapping.identity` and a length derived from `uuids`. If `cell_mapping.identity` is user-controlled or can be manipulated to contain special characters or malicious payloads, it might be used to perform log injection attacks, where logs can be falsified or misleading entries can be introduced.

**Solution:**
Ensure that any data logged is sanitized or validated to prevent log injection. Depending on the exact nature of `cell_mapping.identity`, ensure it does not contain newlines or other control characters that could affect the log format. You could add a sanitization step before this log statement or use structured logging to separate data and message.

For example, you might adjust the logging line to explicitly handle the potential control characters:
```python
# Sanitize or encode the identity value to ensure it is safe to log
safe_cell_identity = cell_mapping.identity.replace('\n', '\\n').replace('\r', '\\r')
LOG.debug('Querying cell %(cell)s for %(num)i instances', {'cell': safe_cell_identity, 'num': len(inst_uuids)})
```

This ensures that the data is treated purely as data and cannot interfere with the format or interpretation of the log itself.
