The provided code initializes a WSGI application for a Nova API, dealing with configuration and logging setup, service initialization, and error handling. Upon review, I found a potential security defect related to the use of environmental variables and file paths:

### Security Defect:
**Directory Traversal Vulnerability**  
The function `_get_config_files` (line 34) uses an environment variable `OS_NOVA_CONFIG_DIR` to determine the directory from which configuration files are loaded (line 37). If an attacker can manipulate the environment in which the Nova service runs, they could potentially set this environment variable to a directory of their choosing. This could lead to the application reading sensitive files or configuration files that have been tampered with from arbitrary locations on the file system.

### Code Section:
```python
34 def _get_config_files(env=None):
35     if env is None:
36         env = os.environ
37     dirname = env.get('OS_NOVA_CONFIG_DIR', '/etc/nova').strip()
38     return [os.path.join(dirname, config_file)
39             for config_file in CONFIG_FILES]
```

### Solution:
To mitigate this risk, it is advisable to add validation checks for the directory path obtained from the environment variable. Ensure that the directory path is within expected boundaries or a list of allowed directories. Additionally, you could enforce absolute path constraints and potentially sanitize the input to avoid directory traversal characters. Here's a revised version of the function with basic checks:

```python
import os

def _get_config_files(env=None):
    if env is None:
        env = os.environ
    dirname = env.get('OS_NOVA_CONFIG_DIR', '/etc/nova').strip()
    # Ensure the directory is within a safe location
    if not dirname.startswith('/etc/nova'):
        raise ValueError("Invalid configuration directory")
    return [os.path.join(dirname, config_file)
            for config_file in CONFIG_FILES]
```

This solution assumes `/etc/nova` as a safe base directory and checks that the provided directory does not deviate from this path. More sophisticated checks might be needed depending on the deployment environment and security requirements.
