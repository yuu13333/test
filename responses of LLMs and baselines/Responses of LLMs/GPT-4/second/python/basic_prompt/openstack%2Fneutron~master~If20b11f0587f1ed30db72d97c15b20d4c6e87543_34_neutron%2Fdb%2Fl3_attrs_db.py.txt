After reviewing the provided code, I have identified a potential security defect related to how the default values and transformations are handled, particularly in the context of availability zones. The issue arises from the way strings and lists are converted and could potentially expose the application to injection or manipulation attacks if not properly sanitized or validated.

**Security Defect Explanation:**
The functions `az_validator.convert_az_list_to_string` and `az_validator.convert_az_string_to_list` used in lines 35 and 36 are critical as they transform input between different formats. If these functions do not properly validate and escape their inputs and outputs, they could potentially be exploited to inject malicious data into the database or execute unintended code when the data is fetched and transformed back. This could lead to issues like SQL injection or other forms of code injection if the transformed data is dynamically interpreted or composed into queries without adequate sanitation.

**Specific Code Location and Recommendations:**
- **Lines 35-36**: The transformation functions `convert_az_list_to_string` and `convert_az_string_to_list` must ensure that any input received is strictly validated against expected formats and properly escaped. It is recommended to:
  - Implement rigorous validation checks within these functions to confirm that the input strictly adheres to the expected list or string format before processing it.
  - Use parameterized queries or equivalent safety measures when inserting or updating database records to avoid SQL injection risks.
  - Consider employing additional security measures such as regular audits of data handling functions and employing automated tools to detect injection vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, while the exact implementations of `convert_az_list_to_string` and `convert_az_string_to_list` are not shown in the code snippet, it is critical to ensure these functions handle data securely. Proper implementation of these recommendations would mitigate the identified potential security defect.
