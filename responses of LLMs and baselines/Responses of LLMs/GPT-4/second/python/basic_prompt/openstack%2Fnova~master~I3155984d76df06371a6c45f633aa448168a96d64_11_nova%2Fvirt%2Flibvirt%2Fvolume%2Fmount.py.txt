Upon reviewing the code, there is a notable security defect related to the manner in which external inputs are utilized in file system operations (specifically, the `mount` and `umount` commands). The primary issue arises from the potential lack of sanitization or validation of external inputs, which could lead to a range of security issues such as command injection or path traversal. Below, I'll detail the specific sections of the code that are problematic and propose solutions:

### Security Defect: Potential Command Injection and Path Traversal
#### Description
The commands `mkdir`, `mount`, `umount`, and `rmdir` are executed with external input, which includes `mountpoint`, `fstype`, `export`, and `options`. The code does not show any explicit sanitization or validation of these inputs before they are used in command execution.

#### Vulnerable Lines
- **Lines 112 and 152** (`mkdir` and `rmdir`): These commands use `mountpoint` directly, which if manipulated, could lead to operations in unintended directories.
- **Line 117** (`mount`): The command construction from `fstype`, `export`, and `mountpoint` can be manipulated if these variables contain unexpected characters or command sequences.
- **Line 145** (`umount`): Directly uses `mountpoint`, which is risky for similar reasons mentioned above.

### Solutions
1. **Sanitize and Validate Inputs**: Before using them in file system operations, inputs such as `mountpoint`, `fstype`, `export`, and any `options` should be rigorously validated against a whitelist of allowed characters and patterns. This helps prevent command injection and path traversal. For instance, ensure `mountpoint` does not contain sequences like `../` or `;`, and that it starts with a predefined path.
   
2. **Escaping Command Arguments**: Ensure that all command arguments are properly escaped to prevent the potential execution of unintended commands. This can be handled by the underlying utilities that execute commands if they support safe argument handling, or by using libraries designed to construct commands safely.

3. **Use Absolute Paths**: Restrict `mountpoint` and other file path operations to absolute paths within a predefined directory. This limits the scope where files can be created or modified and prevents directory traversal attacks.

4. **Logging and Error Handling**: Improve error handling by logging not just the failures but also suspicious patterns in inputs that could indicate attempted exploits. This can help in identifying and mitigating security threats proactively.

By implementing these solutions, the risk of security defects leading to exploitation can be significantly reduced.
