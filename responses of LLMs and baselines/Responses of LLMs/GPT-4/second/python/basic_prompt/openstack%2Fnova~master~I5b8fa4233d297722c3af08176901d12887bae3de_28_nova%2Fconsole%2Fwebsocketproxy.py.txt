After reviewing the provided code, I have identified a couple of potential security issues. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Insecure Cookie Handling (Lines 91-105)**:
   The code handles cookies insecurely by attempting to parse cookies from the header manually. This approach does not inherently protect against security risks such as cookie injection or manipulation. Using insecure cookies without proper validation or secure attributes (like HttpOnly and Secure) can expose the application to attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and session hijacking.

   **Solution**:
   Use a more secure method to handle cookies. Rely on a robust library to manage cookies, ensuring that cookies are validated and contain security attributes like HttpOnly and Secure. This will help in mitigating the risk of client-side script attacks and interception by malicious actors.

2. **Token Validation Overly Dependent on Client-Side Data (Lines 86-106)**:
   The verification of the token is heavily dependent on client-side data, including data passed in query parameters and cookies. Relying solely on client-side controls for authentication token integrity can be risky, especially if not properly validated or securely handled.

   **Solution**:
   Implement server-side validation mechanisms for tokens to ensure they have not been tampered with. Employ robust security measures such as using tokens that are digitally signed or encrypted. Additionally, ensure that the source of the token (whether from a query parameter or a cookie) is verified against a secure source of truth.

These improvements will significantly enhance the security of the application by safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities related to session management and data integrity.
