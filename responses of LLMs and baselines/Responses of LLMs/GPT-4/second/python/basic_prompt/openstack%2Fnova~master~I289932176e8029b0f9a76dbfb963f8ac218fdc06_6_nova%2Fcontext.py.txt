No security defects are detected in the code.

The code provided appears to handle security concerns appropriately. It employs proper authentication and authorization checks, manages database and message queue connections securely, and does not expose sensitive information or credentials. The use of global variables for caching and configurations is typical for the architectural style in which this software operates (likely a large-scale, distributed application like those commonly seen in cloud infrastructure services).

That said, without additional context about the rest of the application environment (e.g., how these functions integrate with other components, the specifics of the deployment environment, etc.), it's not possible to definitively rule out security issues. However, based on the code snippet provided, there are no obvious security flaws.
