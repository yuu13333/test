The provided code appears to be part of a proxy server implementation in Python, specifically designed to handle network metadata requests for Neutron, a project within OpenStack. Upon reviewing the code for security defects, there is one notable issue regarding how user input is handled in the configuration template for HAProxy:

### Security Defect:
**Unsanitized Input in Configuration File Generation (Line 98):**
The code uses Python's string formatting (`%`) to insert user-provided values (e.g., `port`, `unix_socket_path`, `user`, `group`) directly into the HAProxy configuration template. This approach can potentially lead to a security vulnerability known as command injection. If an attacker can control these inputs, particularly `port` and `unix_socket_path`, they might manipulate the configuration file to execute arbitrary commands or alter the behavior of the HAProxy in unintended ways.

### Solution:
To mitigate this issue, the code should implement proper input validation and sanitization before using these values in the configuration file. Here's a general approach:

1. **Validate the Inputs:**
   - Ensure that `port` is a valid integer within the expected range for network ports (usually 1-65535).
   - Validate `unix_socket_path` to ensure it points to a valid and permitted file system path, and does not contain special characters that could lead to directory traversal or other exploits.
   - Check `user` and `group` to confirm they are valid system users and groups, without allowing special characters that could be interpreted by the shell or application.

2. **Sanitize Inputs:**
   - Use appropriate libraries or functions to escape or sanitize inputs that will be inserted into configuration files or command lines to prevent command injection.

3. **Restricted Permissions:**
   - Run the process with the least privilege necessary, ensuring that it does not have permissions beyond what is required to perform its tasks. This helps mitigate the impact of any potential security breaches.

Here is an example of how you might modify the `_create_config_file` method to include input validation for `port`:

```python
def _create_config_file(self):
    # Validate port
    try:
        port_num = int(self.port)
        if not (1 <= port_num <= 65535):
            raise ValueError("Port number must be between 1 and 65535")
    except ValueError as e:
        raise exceptions.InvalidPortNumberError(str(e))

    # Existing code continues...
```

Implementing these changes would enhance the security of the application by preventing potential misuse of the configuration template to perform unintended or malicious actions.
