No security defects are detected in the code.

The code you provided is primarily configuration and metadata for an extension, including aliases, descriptions, timestamps, and empty data structures for resources, sub-resources, and actions. There are no operations on data or external systems, no input handling, and no code execution statements present. Therefore, there are no direct opportunities for security vulnerabilities such as injection, improper input validation, or insecure data handling in this specific portion of code.
