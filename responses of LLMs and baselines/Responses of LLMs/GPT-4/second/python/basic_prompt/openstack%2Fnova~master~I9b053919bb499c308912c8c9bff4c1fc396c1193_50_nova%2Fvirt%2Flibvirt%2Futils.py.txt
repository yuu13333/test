No security defects are detected in the code.

This script mostly interacts with external systems securely using appropriate libraries and methods. It leverages oslo libraries for process execution and filesystem operations, which are designed to handle various security considerations inherent to these tasks. The use of configuration management and encapsulation of functionality in methods, along with error handling, are all consistent with secure programming practices. Additionally, the use of privsep for privilege separation in operations that require elevated privileges enhances the security posture of this script.
