No security defects are detected in the code.

The provided script is a comprehensive set of unit tests for a system that handles various operations related to server instances, particularly focusing on cross-cell migration and resizing in a cloud environment. These tests cover a range of scenarios, including setup, teardown, volume handling, and various state transitions, ensuring that resources are properly allocated, tracked, and cleaned up across different computational cells.

The code primarily concerns testing logic with mocks and simulated behaviors rather than actual system operation, which reduces the likelihood of typical runtime security issues such as injections, improper error handling, or sensitive data exposure.
