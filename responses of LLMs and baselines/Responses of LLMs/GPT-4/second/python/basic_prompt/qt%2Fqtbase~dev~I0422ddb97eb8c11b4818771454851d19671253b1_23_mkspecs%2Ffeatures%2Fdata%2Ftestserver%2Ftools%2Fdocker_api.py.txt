The code you provided shows one significant security defect related to command injection vulnerability, which occurs in the following section:

**Security Defect 1: Command Injection Vulnerability**
- **Location**: Line 74
- **Description**: The code constructs a Docker command using unvalidated input from `install_list`, which is derived from `self.install`. This presents a risk where an attacker could inject additional shell commands. For example, if `self.install` contains a string like `; rm -rf / #`, this would terminate the `apt-get install` command and begin executing the `rm -rf /` command, leading to potential disastrous outcomes like deletion of system files.
- **Solution**: Always validate and sanitize inputs used in command construction. One effective approach is to use lists for subprocess calls, which avoids the need to handle shell metacharacters:

    ```python
    if install_list:
        command = ['apt-get', 'install'] + install_list.split() + ['-y']
        config_list.append('RUN ' + ' '.join(command))
    ```

This change ensures that each part of the command is treated as a separate argument to the subprocess, mitigating the risk of shell injection.

Additionally, while not strictly a security defect, the use of environment variables and file reading (e.g., lines 99-104 and 112) should be handled cautiously to avoid information disclosure or unintended behavior due to external modifications. Always ensure that your environment variables are secure and that file access operations are conducted safely, checking for file existence and handling exceptions appropriately.
