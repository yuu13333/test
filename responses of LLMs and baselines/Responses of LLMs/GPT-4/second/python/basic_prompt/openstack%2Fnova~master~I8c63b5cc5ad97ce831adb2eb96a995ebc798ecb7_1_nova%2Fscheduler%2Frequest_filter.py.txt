No security defects are detected in the code provided. 

The code effectively utilizes functions with proper exception handling, and it contains several checks and filters based on the configuration and input specifications, modifying the request as necessary without obvious security risks. Each function has clear purposes and the input data is handled securely within the given constraints. There are also specific checks for feature enablement and correct use of nova objects and configurations.

It is always good practice, however, to ensure that any external configurations and user inputs, like those referenced in `nova.conf` and `request_spec`, are validated and sanitized appropriately at the point where they are initially received or loaded, even though these aspects are not explicitly shown in this code snippet.
