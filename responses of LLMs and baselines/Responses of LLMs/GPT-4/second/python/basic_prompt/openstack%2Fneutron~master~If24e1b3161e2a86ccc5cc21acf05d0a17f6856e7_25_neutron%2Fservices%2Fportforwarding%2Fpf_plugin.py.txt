After reviewing the provided code, I identified a potential security defect related to IP address validation in the `_get_subnet_check_valid_internal_ip` method (lines 80-85). This method checks if a given `request_ip` matches any `ip_address` from `exist_fixed_ips`. However, the defect arises due to the improper comparison of IP addresses using the `==` operator between `IPNetwork` objects.

### Security Defect Description:
The function converts both `fixed_ip['ip_address']` and `request_ip` to `IPNetwork` objects and compares them using the `==` operator. However, creating an `IPNetwork` from a single IP address results in a network that includes only that one IP (assuming a `/32` for IPv4 or `/128` for IPv6), and using `==` between two `IPNetwork` objects checks for exact network match, not just the IP address. This means the comparison as written will usually work as intended, but it's not the correct semantic for comparing individual IP addresses and can lead to unexpected behavior if subnet masks or CIDRs are involved differently.

### Solution:
To correct this, you should directly compare the IP addresses without converting them to network objects, or explicitly use IP address objects without network masks for direct IP comparison:

```python
from netaddr import IPAddress

def _get_subnet_check_valid_internal_ip(self, request_ip, exist_fixed_ips):
    for fixed_ip in exist_fixed_ips:
        if IPAddress(fixed_ip['ip_address']) == IPAddress(request_ip):
            return fixed_ip['subnet_id']
```
This change ensures that the comparison is done between the IP address parts only, disregarding any network mask that might be mistakenly considered in the comparison. This not only corrects the logical error but also improves the clarity and correctness of the comparison, ensuring it behaves as expected in all scenarios where only IP address matching is intended.
