The code below has a security defect. It is possible for a user running a client of this application to elevate privileges by configuring the application with malicious keyboard mappings.

```cpp
        if (!QChar::requiresSurrogates(key)) {
            p = QChar::fromUcs2(key).toUpper();
        } else {
            p += QChar(QChar::highSurrogate(key));
            p += QChar(QChar::lowSurrogate(key));
        }
```

This code allows ASCII characters, including 0x1b (the Escape character), to be used as a mnemonic. For example, an application menu could have the following entry:

```text
&Edit
```

If the user configures their operating system to rebind the Escape key to the letter `e`, then when the user clicks on "Edit" and quickly presses the Escape key, the compromised application will perform the "Edit" action instead of closing the current menu.

To fix this issue, all mnemonic characters must be verified to ensure that they cannot be mapped to a non-alphanumeric character. For example, the following code ensures that only alphabetic characters can be used as mnemonics:

```cpp
if (!QChar::requiresSurrogates(key)) {
    QChar c = QChar::fromUcs2(key).toUpper();
    if (c.isLetter())
        p = c;
}
```
