The code contains the following security defects:

**Line 211:** 
* **Security Defect:** Potential Error Message Exposure
* **Description:** The warning message logged to the console may reveal the path to the installation directory of the application, which could be used by an attacker to gain information about the system.
* **Solution:** Remove the directory path from the warning message or use a more generic message that does not disclose sensitive information.

**Line 225:**
* **Security Defect:** Insecure Reading of Settings
* **Description:** The function reads the theme setting from a QSettings object without checking if the setting is coming from a trusted source. This could allow an attacker to modify the settings and potentially compromise the application's behavior.
* **Solution:** Implement proper input validation to ensure that the setting is coming from a trusted source before using it.
