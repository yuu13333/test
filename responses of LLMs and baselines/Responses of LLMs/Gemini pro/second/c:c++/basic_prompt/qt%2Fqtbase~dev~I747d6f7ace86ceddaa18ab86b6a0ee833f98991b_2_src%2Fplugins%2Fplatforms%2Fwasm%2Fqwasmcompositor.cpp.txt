Line 83: The QOffscreenSurface on Wasm is tied to a single canvas.
```
This line indicates that the QOffscreenSurface on Wasm is tied to a single canvas. This means that only one QOffscreenSurface can be used at a time, and that it is tied to a specific canvas element on the web page. This can be a limitation if you need to use multiple QOffscreenSurfaces simultaneously, or if you need to use a QOffscreenSurface that is not tied to a specific canvas element.

**Solution:**

If you need to use multiple QOffscreenSurfaces simultaneously, or if you need to use a QOffscreenSurface that is not tied to a specific canvas element, you can create a new QOffscreenSurface for each canvas element that you need to use. Alternatively, you can use a QOpenGLFramebufferObject to create a separate rendering context for each canvas element.

Line 159: if (m_compositedWindows.size() <= 1)
```
This line checks if the number of composited windows is less than or equal to 1. If it is, then the function returns early without performing any further actions. This can be a problem if you have more than one composited window, as the function will not perform any of the necessary operations to update the windows.

**Solution:**

Remove the check for the number of composited windows and allow the function to perform its operations regardless of the number of windows.

```
Line 172: if (m_compositedWindows.size() <= 1)
```
This line is similar to the previous one, but it checks the number of composited windows when lowering a window. Again, this can be a problem if you have more than one composited window, as the function will not perform the necessary operations to lower the window.

**Solution:**

Remove the check for the number of composited windows and allow the function to perform its operations regardless of the number of windows.

```
Line 220: blit(blitter, screen, texture, targetGeometry);
```
This line calls the blit() function to blit the texture to the target geometry. However, the blit() function is defined later in the file, and it is not clear what its arguments are or what it does. This can make it difficult to understand how the window content is being drawn.

**Solution:**

Move the definition of the blit() function to a more appropriate location, such as the top of the file, and provide documentation for its arguments and functionality.

```
Line 398: frame();
```
This line calls the frame() function to update the window content. However, the frame() function is defined later in the file, and it is not clear what its arguments are or what it does. This can make it difficult to understand how the window content is being updated.

**Solution:**

Move the definition of the frame() function to a more appropriate location, such as the top of the file, and provide documentation for its arguments and functionality.

```
Line 733: if (!m_isEnabled || m_windowStack.empty() || !screen())
```
This line checks if the compositor is enabled, if the window stack is empty, or if there is no screen. If any of these conditions are true, the function returns early without performing any further actions. This can be a problem if you need to update the window content even if one of these conditions is true.

**Solution:**

Remove the checks for the compositor being enabled, the window stack being empty, and the screen being null. Allow the function to perform its operations regardless of the state of these conditions.
