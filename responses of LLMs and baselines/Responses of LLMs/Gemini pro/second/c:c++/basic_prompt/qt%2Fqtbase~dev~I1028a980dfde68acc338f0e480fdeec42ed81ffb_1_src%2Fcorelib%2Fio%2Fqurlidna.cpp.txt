Line 101: This code is potentially vulnerable to a buffer overrun because it does not check the size of the output buffer before appending to it. This could result in data being written outside of the intended buffer, which could lead to memory corruption or other security issues.

To fix this issue, the code should check the size of the output buffer before appending to it. This can be done using the following code:

```
if (output->length() + in.length() > MaxDomainLabelLength * 2)
    return;
```

This code checks the length of the output buffer and the length of the input string, and if the total length is greater than the maximum allowed length, it returns without appending to the output buffer.
