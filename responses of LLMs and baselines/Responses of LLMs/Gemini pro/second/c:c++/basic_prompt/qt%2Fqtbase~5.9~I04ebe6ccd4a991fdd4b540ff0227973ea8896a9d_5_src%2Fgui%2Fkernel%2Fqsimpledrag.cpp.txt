There is a possible security defect in the QSimpleDrag class. Line 404 in the code provided shows the following vulnerability:

```cpp
const QPoint pos = nativeGlobalPos - window->handle()->geometry().topLeft();
```

This line calculates the position of the object being dragged relative to the top-left corner of the target window by subtracting the top-left corner of the target window's handle from the native global position. However, it is possible for the target window's handle to be in a different position than the window itself, which could allow an attacker to drag the object to a different location than intended.

The correct way to calculate the position of the object being dragged relative to the target window is to subtract the target window's position from the native global position:

```cpp
const QPoint pos = nativeGlobalPos - window->geometry().topLeft();
```

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
55 void QSimpleDrag::move(const QPoint &nativeGlobalPos)
56 {
57     QPoint globalPos = fromNativeGlobalPixels(nativeGlobalPos);
58     moveShapedPixmapWindow(globalPos);
59     QWindow *window = topLevelAt(globalPos);
60     if (!window)
61         return;
62 
63     const QPoint pos = nativeGlobalPos - window->geometry().topLeft();
64     const QPlatformDragQtResponse qt_response =
65         QWindowSystemInterface::handleDrag(window, drag()->mimeData(), pos, drag()->supportedActions());
66 
67     updateCursor(qt_response.acceptedAction());
68     setCanDrop(qt_response.isAccepted());
69 }
```
