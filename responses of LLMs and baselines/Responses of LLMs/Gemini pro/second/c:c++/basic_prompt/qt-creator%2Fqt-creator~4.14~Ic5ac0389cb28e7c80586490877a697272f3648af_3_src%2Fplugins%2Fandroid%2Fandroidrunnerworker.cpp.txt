**Line 407**: Race condition: The return value of this line is stored in `selector`, which is a reference to the `selector` method called at line 405. If another thread calls the `selector` method between lines 405 and 407, the value returned by `selector()` will be incorrect.

**Solution**: Add a mutex to protect the access to the `selector` method.

```cpp
std::mutex selector_mutex;

QStringList AndroidRunnerWorker::selector() const
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(selector_mutex);

    return AndroidDeviceInfo::adbSelector(m_deviceSerialNumber);
}
```
