Line 748 - 758: Due to the input value of `zAxis` being a normalized direction, the following check returns `false`:
```cpp
     if (qFuzzyIsNull(xAxis.lengthSquared())) {
         // collinear or invalid up vector; derive shortest arc to new direction
         return QQuaternion::rotationTo(QVector3D(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f), zAxis);
     }
```
This check is intended to guard against collinear or invalid `up` vectors by testing the length of the cross product between `up` and `zAxis`. However, since `zAxis` is already a normalized direction, the cross product between `up` and `zAxis` will always have a length of 0, regardless of the input value of `up`, leading to the check always failing.
A possible fix would be to check the length of the cross product between `up` and `xAxis` instead, as this check would correctly identify collinear or invalid `up` vectors.
