- Possible Integer Overflow

The return value of the `read(...)` function is cast to `qint64` without checking for integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the underlying function returns a value that is too large to be represented as a `qint64`. This should be changed to use `static_cast<qint64>(...)` to ensure that the result is always a `qint64`.
