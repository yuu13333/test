There is a potential security issue in line 384. The `setSupportedSchemes` function takes a string list of schemes and sets the supported schemes for the file dialog. However, there is no input validation to ensure that the schemes are valid. This could allow an attacker to specify a malicious scheme that could be used to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.

To fix this issue, the `setSupportedSchemes` function should be updated to validate the input schemes. This could be done by checking that the schemes are all valid URI schemes, or by only allowing a predefined list of schemes.
