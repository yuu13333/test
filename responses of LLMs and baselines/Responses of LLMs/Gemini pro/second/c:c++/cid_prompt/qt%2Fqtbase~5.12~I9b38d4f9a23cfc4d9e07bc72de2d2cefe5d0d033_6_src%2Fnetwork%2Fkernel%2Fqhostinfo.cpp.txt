1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: No security defects of this type are detected in the code. The lookupHost, abortHostLookup, fromName, and localHostName functions all have appropriate access controls in place. 


2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: No security defects of this type are detected in the code. The interaction between different components of the QHostInfo class is well-defined and does not lead to any vulnerabilities.


3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: No security defects of this type are detected in the code. The QHostInfoLookupManager properly manages the lifecycle of QHostInfoRunnable objects, ensuring that they are properly cleaned up when no longer needed.


4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: No security defects of this type are detected in the code. The calculations performed by the QHostInfo class are correct and do not lead to any vulnerabilities.


5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: No security defects of this type are detected in the code. The QHostInfo class has appropriate control flow management in place to prevent unexpected or malicious behavior.


6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: No security defects of this type are detected in the code. The QHostInfo class employs appropriate protection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access or modification of its data.


7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: No security defects of this type are detected in the code. Comparisons performed by the QHostInfo class are correct and do not lead to any vulnerabilities.


8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: No security defects of this type are detected in the code. The QHostInfo class properly handles exceptional conditions, such as lookup failures, and does not allow them to compromise the security of the system.


9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: No security defects of this type are detected in the code. The QHostInfo class does not perform any operations that require input neutralization, so this issue is not applicable.


10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: No security defects of this type are detected in the code. The QHostInfo class adheres to industry-standard coding practices and guidelines.

Therefore, no security defects are detected in the provided code.
