1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
   - Line 360: The `storeToolState` function takes a `sceneId` and a `tool` as arguments, but there is no check to ensure that the `sceneId` is valid or that the `tool` is authorized to access the scene. This could allow an attacker to access or modify the scene without authorization.
   - Line 385: The `initToolStates` function takes a `sceneId` and a `toolStates` map as arguments, but there is no check to ensure that the `sceneId` is valid. This could allow an attacker to initialize the tool states for a scene that they are not authorized to access.

2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
   - Line 429: The `setMultiSelectionTargets` function takes a `multiSelectRootNode` and a `selectedList` as arguments, but there is no check to ensure that the `multiSelectRootNode` is a valid parent for the nodes in the `selectedList`. This could allow an attacker to add arbitrary nodes to the multiselection, even if they are not children of the `multiSelectRootNode`.

3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
   - Line 459: The `onDestroyed` signal handler for the multiselection nodes does not properly clean up the multiselection state. This could lead to memory leaks or other resource leaks.

4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
   - Line 513: The `moveMultiSelection` function calculates the global offset for the multiselection nodes based on the difference between the current scene position of the multiselection root node and the start scene position. However, this calculation does not take into account the scale of the multiselection root node, which could lead to incorrect positioning of the nodes.

5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
   - Line 499: The `restartMultiSelection` function resets the multiselection node and sets the `blockMultiSelectionNodePositioning` flag to `true`. However, there is no check to ensure that the `blockMultiSelectionNodePositioning` flag is set to `false` after the multiselection has been repositioned. This could lead to the multiselection node being permanently locked in its current position.

6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
   - Line 589: The `isMacOS` function returns `false` on non-macOS platforms, but does not check for other operating systems. This could lead to incorrect behavior on non-macOS platforms.

7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
   - Line 607: The `isRotationBlocked` function checks if a node is contained in the `m_rotationBlockedNodes` set using the `contains` method. However, this method does not take into account the possibility that the node may have been removed from the set while the function was executing. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the node is removed from the set during the function call.

8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
   - Line 614: The `eventFilter` function checks if the event is a `QEvent::DynamicPropertyChange` event, but does not check if the property that changed is actually "_edit3dLocked" or "_edit3dHidden". This could lead to incorrect behavior if another property is changed.

9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
   - Line 279: The `delayedPropertySet` function uses `QTimer::singleShot` to set a property on an object after a delay. However, this function does not check if the object still exists or is valid when the timer expires. This could lead to a crash if the object is deleted before the timer expires.

10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
   - Line 80: The `generateUniqueName` function uses a static hash table to generate unique names for objects. However, the hash table is not thread-safe, which could lead to race conditions and incorrect behavior if the function is called from multiple threads concurrently.
