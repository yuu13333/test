1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - **Description**: This defect occurs when there is a lack of proper access control mechanisms in place, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
   - **Line Number**: N/A
   - **Solution**: Implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict access to authorized users only.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
   - **Description**: This defect occurs when multiple components or entities interact in an unintended or incorrect way, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
   - **Line Number**: N/A
   - **Solution**: Carefully design and document the interactions between different components to ensure proper functionality and avoid unintended consequences.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - **Description**: This defect occurs when resources are not properly managed throughout their lifecycle, leading to memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or other issues.
   - **Line Number**: N/A
   - **Solution**: Implement proper resource management techniques to ensure resources are allocated, used, and deallocated appropriately.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
   - **Description**: This defect occurs when calculations are performed incorrectly, leading to inaccurate results or unexpected behavior.
   - **Line Number**: N/A
   - **Solution**: Carefully review and verify all calculations to ensure they are accurate and produce the intended results.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
   - **Description**: This defect occurs when control flow is not managed properly, leading to unintended execution paths or security vulnerabilities.
   - **Line Number**: N/A
   - **Solution**: Implement proper control flow management techniques to ensure that the program executes as intended and does not deviate from the expected path.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
   - **Description**: This defect occurs when a protection mechanism fails to prevent an attack or vulnerability from being exploited.
   - **Line Number**: N/A
   - **Solution**: Implement robust protection mechanisms and ensure they are properly configured and maintained to prevent unauthorized access or exploitation.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
   - **Description**: This defect occurs when incorrect comparisons are made, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
   - **Line Number**: N/A
   - **Solution**: Carefully review and verify all comparisons to ensure they are accurate and produce the intended results.

   - **Description**: This defect occurs when exceptional conditions are not properly checked or handled, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
   - **Line Number**: N/A
   - **Solution**: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to ensure that exceptional conditions are handled gracefully and do not cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
   - **Description**: This defect occurs when user input or data from untrusted sources is not properly neutralized or sanitized, leading to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.
   - **Line Number**: N/A
   - **Solution**: Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to ensure that untrusted data is neutralized before it is used in the program.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
   - **Description**: This defect occurs when coding standards are not followed, leading to inconsistent and potentially vulnerable code.
   - **Line Number**: N/A
   - **Solution**: Establish and enforce coding standards to ensure that code is written in a consistent and secure manner.
