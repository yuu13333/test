Line 861 - Hard coding `true` in `q.setForwardOnly` function. This value should be replaced by a parameter or a variable.

**Solution:**
```cpp
q.setForwardOnly(forwardOnly);
```

**Other Recommendations:**
There are more than one issue detected in the code:

- Line 253 - It is recommended to avoid using empty result set since the `sqlite3_column_type` behavior is undefined in this case.

- Line 347 - It is recommended to use a switch case statement instead of `if-else-if` statement to avoid potential errors.

- Line 533 - It is recommended to use `qFatal` when an error occurs instead of `setLastError`.

- Line 542-543 - It is recommended to check if `res` is `SQLITE_ERROR` to get the actual error message.

- Line 544-545 - It is recommended to use `qFatal` to notify that a parameter count mismatch has occurred instead of `setLastError`.

- Line 669 - The `Transactions` feature is not fully implemented in the code.

- Line 769-770 - It is recommended to check if `sqlite3_create_function_v2` returns `SQLITE_OK` before setting the cache.
