The following security defect has been found in the code:

**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** Line 131

**Description**: The code doesn't handle cases when multiple devices are started/stopped/reset/renamed/deleted simultaneously. Multiple selected devices can be started without asking for any confirmation. The same goes for other operations as well (except renaming)

**Solution**: When multiple devices are selected, confirm the operation with a user prompt before starting/stopping/resetting/renaming/deleting them.
