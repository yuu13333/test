**CWE-435:** Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities
Line number 234: This event is set before the pipeReader is unlocked, which can cause a race condition where the thread immediately runs into the lock after being released. To avoid this, the event should be set after the lock is released.
**Solution:** Set the event after releasing the lock.

**CWE-682:** Incorrect Calculation
Line number 355: The read operation is considered successful if the error code is ERROR_SUCCESS or ERROR_MORE_DATA. However, ERROR_MORE_DATA indicates that the message didn't fit into the pipe's system buffer, and the function should return false in this case.
**Solution:** Return false when the error code is ERROR_MORE_DATA.

**CWE-693:** Protection Mechanism Failure
Line number 145: If the CancelIoEx function fails, the code ignores the error if it's ERROR_NOT_FOUND. However, other errors should be handled properly to ensure that the I/O operation is canceled correctly.
**Solution:** Handle all errors from CancelIoEx and log or report them appropriately.

**CWE-703:** Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Line number 507: The checkPipeState function is called without holding the mutex, which can lead to a race condition if another thread is modifying the pipe state.
**Solution:** Acquire the mutex before calling checkPipeState.

**CWE-707:** Improper Neutralization
Line number 265: The errorCode variable is initialized to ERROR_SUCCESS, but it can be overwritten by GetLastError() even if the ReadFile function succeeds.
**Solution:** Initialize errorCode to 0 or another appropriate value to ensure that it's properly set.

**CWE-710:** Improper Adherence to Coding Standards
Line number 189: The code does not check for the return value of WaitForSingleObjectEx, which can lead to errors being missed.
**Solution:** Check the return value of WaitForSingleObjectEx and handle errors appropriately.
