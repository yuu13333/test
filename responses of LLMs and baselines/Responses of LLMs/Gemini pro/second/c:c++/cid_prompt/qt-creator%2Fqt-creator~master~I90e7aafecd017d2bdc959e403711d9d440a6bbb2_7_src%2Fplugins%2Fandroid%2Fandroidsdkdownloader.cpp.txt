1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - Line 72: The `downloadAndExtractSdk` function does not perform any access control checks before downloading and extracting the SDK. This could allow an attacker to download and extract malicious software onto the user's system.
   - Solution: Add access control checks to the `downloadAndExtractSdk` function to ensure that only authorized users can download and extract the SDK.
2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - Line 82: The `request` variable is created on the stack and is not properly cleaned up. This could lead to a memory leak if the request is not successfully completed.
   - Solution: Move the `request` variable to the heap and ensure that it is properly deleted when it is no longer needed.
3. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
   - Line 145: The `i` variable is incremented unconditionally in the while loop. This could lead to an infinite loop if the `QFile::exists` function always returns true.
   - Solution: Add a condition to the while loop to ensure that the `i` variable is only incremented if the `QFile::exists` function returns false.
4. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
   - Line 177: The `isHttpRedirect` function compares the `statusCode` variable to multiple values using the `||` operator. This could lead to incorrect results if the `statusCode` variable is equal to more than one of the values.
   - Solution: Use the `&&` operator instead of the `||` operator to ensure that the `isHttpRedirect` function only returns true if the `statusCode` variable is equal to all of the values.
5. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
   - Line 160: The `saveToDisk` function does not handle the case where the `file` variable is not successfully opened. This could lead to the function returning false even if the data was successfully written to disk.
   - Solution: Add error handling to the `saveToDisk` function to ensure that it returns true only if the data was successfully written to disk.
