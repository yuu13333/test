**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

* Line 90:
 * The dead map iterator is used to delete a backend from s_calendars, which may lead to use-after-free errors and undefined behavior.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**

* Line 186:
 * The isLeapYear function relies on the maxDaysInYear function which in turn relies on monthsInYear function. This dependency may lead to inconsistent behavior if one of these functions is overridden in a subclass.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

* Line 90:
 * The dead map iterator is used to delete a backend from s_calendars, which may lead to dangling pointers and resource leaks.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**

* Line 186:
 * The isLeapYear function relies on the maxDaysInYear function which in turn relies on monthsInYear function. This dependency may lead to incorrect calculations if one of these functions is overridden in a subclass.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**

* Line 81:
 * The registerCalendar function does not check if the backend is already registered before registration, which may lead to multiple registrations of the same backend.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**

* Line 90:
 * The dead map iterator is used to delete a backend from s_calendars, which may lead to a broken lock if the backend is still locked by another thread.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**

* Line 90:
 * The dead map iterator is used to compare with other map iterators, which may lead to incorrect equality comparisons.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**

* Line 81:
 * The registerCalendar function does not handle the case when the backend is already registered, which may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**

* Line 90:
 * The dead map iterator is used to access the backend, which may lead to uninitialized memory access and undefined behavior.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

* Overall, the code does not follow consistent coding standards. For example, some functions use Hungarian notation while others do not.

**Solution:**

```cpp
// CWE-284, CWE-664
auto dead = std::remove_if(s_calendars.begin(), s_calendars.end(),
                            [this] (QCalendarBackend *it) -> bool {
                                return it == this;
                            });
while (dead != s_calendars.end())
    dead = s_calendars.erase(dead);
```

```cpp
// CWE-435, CWE-682
int QCalendarBackend::daysInYear(int year) const
{
    return monthsInYear(year) ? isLeapYear(year) ? 366 : 365 : 0;
}
```

```cpp
// CWE-691
bool QCalendarBackend::registerCalendar(const QString &name)
{
    Q_ASSERT(!name.isEmpty());
    if (s_calendars.contains(name)) {
        qDebug() << "Calendar name" << name << "is already taken";
        return false;
    }

    // Register the backend and return true
    s_calendars.insert(name, this);
    return true;
}
```

```cpp
// CWE-693
auto dead = std::remove_if(s_calendars.begin(), s_calendars.end(),
                            [this] (QCalendarBackend *it) -> bool {
                                return it == this;
                            });
while (dead != s_calendars.end())
    dead = s_calendars.erase(dead);
```

```cpp
// CWE-697
auto dead = std::remove_if(s_calendars.begin(), s_calendars.end(),
                            [this] (QCalendarBackend *it) -> bool {
                                return it == this;
                            });
while (dead != s_calendars.end())
    dead = s_calendars.erase(dead);
```

```cpp
// CWE-703
bool QCalendarBackend::registerCalendar(const QString &name)
{
    Q_ASSERT(!name.isEmpty());
    if (s_calendars.contains(name)) {
        qDebug() << "Calendar name" << name << "is already taken";
        return false;
    }

    // Register the backend and return true
    s_calendars.insert(name, this);
    return true;
}
```

```cpp
// CWE-707
auto dead = std::remove_if(s_calendars.begin(), s_calendars.end(),
                            [this] (QCalendarBackend *it) -> bool {
                                return it == this;
                            });
while (dead != s_calendars.end())
    dead = s_calendars.erase(dead);
```

The remaining defects (CWE-710) can be addressed by enforcing consistent coding standards through code review or automated tools.
