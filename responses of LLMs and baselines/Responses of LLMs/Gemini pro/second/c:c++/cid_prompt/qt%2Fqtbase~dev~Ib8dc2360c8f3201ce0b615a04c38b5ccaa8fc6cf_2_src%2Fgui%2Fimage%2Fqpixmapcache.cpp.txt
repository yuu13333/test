**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

- **Line 194:** The `QPMCache` class is a private implementation class of `QPixmapCache`. It has the `insert()`, `remove()`, and `replace()` methods that are accessible to the `QPixmapCache` class, but not to any external code. This helps protect the cache from unauthorized access or modification.

- **Line 330:** The `insert()` method in `QPMCache` checks for an existing key in the `cacheKeys` hash and removes it if found. This prevents multiple pixmaps from being associated with the same key, ensuring proper access control to the cache.

- **Line 338:** The `createKey()` method generates a new key that is unique within the cache. This helps prevent collisions and ensures that each pixmap has a unique identifier.

- **Line 397:** The `remove()` method in `QPMCache` takes a `QPixmapCache::Key` as a parameter and removes the corresponding pixmap and key from the cache. This provides a controlled way to remove pixmaps from the cache, preventing unauthorized deletion.

- **Line 632:** The `remove()` method in `QPixmapCache` removes the pixmap associated with a given key from the cache. This provides a controlled way to remove pixmaps from the cache, preventing unauthorized deletion.

- **Line 642:** The `remove()` method in `QPixmapCache` checks for the validity of the `Key` before removing the corresponding pixmap. This helps prevent the removal of pixmaps that are no longer valid.


**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**

- **Line 88:** The `QPixmapCache` class is a static class, meaning that there is only one instance of it in the program. This ensures that all interactions with the cache are coordinated through a single point of access, preventing conflicts or inconsistencies.

- **Line 247:** The `QPMCache` constructor creates a single instance of the cache and initializes its internal data structures. This ensures that the cache is properly initialized before any operations are performed on it.

- **Line 455:** The `pm_cache` global static variable is used to access the single instance of the `QPMCache` class. This provides a consistent way to access the cache from anywhere in the program, preventing confusion or errors.

- **Line 330:** The `insert()` method in `QPMCache` checks for an existing key in the `cacheKeys` hash and removes it if found. This prevents multiple pixmaps from being associated with the same key, ensuring proper coordination between the cache and the application.

- **Line 631:** The `remove()` method in `QPixmapCache` takes a `QString` key as a parameter and removes the corresponding pixmap from the cache. This provides a controlled way to remove pixmaps from the cache, preventing conflicts or inconsistencies.

- **Line 641:** The `remove()` method in `QPixmapCache` takes a `QPixmapCache::Key` as a parameter and removes the corresponding pixmap from the cache. This provides a controlled way to remove pixmaps from the cache, preventing conflicts or inconsistencies.


**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

- **Line 88:** The `QPixmapCache` class is a static class, meaning that it exists throughout the lifetime of the program. This ensures that the cache is always available for use, preventing resource leaks or premature deallocation.

- **Line 111:** The `QPixmapCache::Key` constructor initializes the `d` pointer to `0`, indicating that the key is empty. This helps prevent the use of uninitialized keys and ensures proper resource management.

- **Line 120:** The `QPixmapCache::Key` copy constructor checks for the validity of the `other` key and increments the reference count if the key is valid. This helps prevent double-free errors and ensures proper resource management.

- **Line 130:** The `QPixmapCache::Key` destructor decrements the reference count and deletes the `d` pointer if the reference count reaches 0. This helps prevent memory leaks and ensures proper resource management.

- **Line 455:** The `pm_cache` global static variable is a pointer to a `QPMCache` object. Since it is a global variable, it exists throughout the lifetime of the program. This ensures that the cache is always available for use, preventing resource leaks or premature deallocation.

- **Line 631:** The `remove()` method in `QPixmapCache` takes a `QString` key as a parameter and removes the corresponding pixmap from the cache. This helps prevent resource leaks by ensuring that unused pixmaps are removed from the cache.

- **Line 641:** The `remove()` method in `QPixmapCache` takes a `QPixmapCache::Key` as a parameter and removes the corresponding pixmap from the cache. This helps prevent resource leaks by ensuring that unused pixmaps are removed from the cache.


**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**

- **Line 92:** The `cost()` function calculates the cost of a pixmap in kilobytes. It uses the formula `(pixmap.width() * pixmap.height() * pixmap.depth() / 8) / 1024`. This formula correctly calculates the size of the pixmap in bytes and then converts it to kilobytes.

- **Line 455:** The `pm_cache` global static variable is initialized with a new instance of the `QPMCache` class. This ensures that the cache is properly initialized with the default settings, including the cache limit.

- **Line 611:** The `cacheLimit()` method in `QPixmapCache` returns the maximum cost (in kilobytes) that the cache can hold. This value is used by the cache to determine when it needs to remove pixmaps to make space for new ones.

- **Line 624:** The `setCacheLimit()` method in `QPixmapCache` sets the maximum cost (in kilobytes) that the cache can hold. This allows the application to adjust the cache size as needed, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.


**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**

- **Line 253:** The `~QPMCache()` destructor calls `clear()` to remove all pixmaps from the cache. This ensures that the cache is properly cleaned up when it is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks or resource exhaustion.

- **Line 268:** The `flushDetachedPixmaps()` method checks if the cache size has been reduced by 25% and, if so, removes any detached pixmaps. This helps prevent the cache from growing too large and consuming excessive resources.

- **Line 292:** The `timerEvent()` method checks if the cache size has been reduced and, if not, restarts the timer. This ensures that the cache is regularly checked for detached pixmaps and cleaned up as needed, preventing resource exhaustion.

- **Line 654:** The `clear()` method in `QPixmapCache` calls `clear()` on the `pm_cache` instance. This ensures that all pixmaps are removed from the cache and the cache is properly reset, preventing resource leaks or inconsistencies.

- **Line 665:** The `flushDetachedPixmaps()` method in `QPixmapCache` calls `flushDetachedPixmaps()` on the `pm_cache` instance. This ensures that any detached pixmaps are removed from the cache, preventing resource exhaustion.


**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**

- **Line 184:** The `QPMCache::operator=` method checks if the `other` key is valid and, if so, increments the reference count and decrements the reference count for the current key. This helps prevent double-free errors and ensures proper protection against memory corruption.

- **Line 455:** The `pm_cache` global static variable is a pointer to a `QPMCache` object. It is initialized with a new instance of `QPMCache` in the `QPMCache` constructor. This ensures that the cache is properly initialized and protected against memory corruption.


**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**

- **Line 142:** The `QPixmapCache::Key::operator==` method compares the `d` pointers of two keys. This is the correct way to compare keys for equality, as it ensures that two keys refer to the same underlying pixmap.


**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**

- **Line 464:** The `QPixmapCacheEntry` destructor releases the key associated with the cache entry. This helps prevent memory leaks and ensures proper cleanup of resources in case of exceptions.

- **Line 516:** The `find()` method in `QPixmapCache` checks if the pixmap pointer is not null before assigning it to the output parameter. This helps prevent null pointer dereferences and ensures that the output parameter is assigned a valid pixmap if one is found.

- **Line 535:** The `find()` method in `QPixmapCache` checks if the pixmap pointer is not null before assigning it to the output parameter. This helps prevent null pointer dereferences and ensures that the output parameter is assigned a valid pixmap if one is found.


**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**

- **Line 66
