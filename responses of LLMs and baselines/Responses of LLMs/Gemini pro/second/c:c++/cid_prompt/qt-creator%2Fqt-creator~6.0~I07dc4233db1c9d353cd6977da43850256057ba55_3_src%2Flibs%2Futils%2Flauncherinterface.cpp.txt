**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
- In line 213, it is observed that the call to `instance()` function is not protected by a mutex. This can lead to a race condition where multiple threads could be trying to access the instance simultaneously.
- Solution: The call to `instance()` function should be protected by a mutex to ensure that only one thread can access the instance at a time.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
- In line 123, the `QLocalServer::removeServer` function is called with the socket name as an argument. However, the socket name is not verified before being passed to the function. This can lead to the function removing the wrong server and causing unexpected behavior.
- Solution: The socket name should be verified before being passed to the `QLocalServer::removeServer` function to ensure that the correct server is removed.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
- In line 171, the `QProcess::errorString` function is used to check if the process finished successfully. However, the function returns an empty string if the process finished successfully, which could lead to the `handleProcessFinished` function being executed even when the process finished successfully.
- Solution: The `QProcess::exitStatus` function should be used to check if the process finished successfully.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
- In line 129, the `connect` function is used to connect the `errorOccurred` signal to the `handleProcessError` slot. However, the function does not check if the connection was successful, which could lead to the signal not being emitted when the error occurs.
- Solution: The `connect` function should be checked to ensure that the connection was successful.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
- In line 187, the `s_pathToLauncher` variable is declared as a static string. However, it is not initialized, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
- Solution: The `s_pathToLauncher` variable should be initialized to an empty string to ensure that it is always initialized.
