The following security defects are found in the code:

1. CWE-284: Improper Access Control
> Line 109: The size() function returns the number of (key, value) pairs stored in the object. However, there is no check to ensure that the object is not empty before accessing its elements. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the object is empty and the attacker tries to access its elements.
> ```cpp
	int QJsonObject::size() const
	{
		return o ? o->elements.length() : 0;
	}
```
To fix this issue, a check should be added to ensure that the object is not empty before accessing its elements.

2. CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison
> Line 288: The isEmpty() function returns true if the object is empty. However, the function uses the expression !o || o->elements.isEmpty() to check if the object is empty. This expression is not correct because it will return true if the object is not empty but its elements list is empty.
> ```cpp
	bool QJsonObject::isEmpty() const
	{
		return !o || o->elements.isEmpty();
	}
```
To fix this issue, the expression should be changed to o == nullptr || o->elements.isEmpty().

3. CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
> Line 318: The indexOf() function searches for a key in the object and returns the index of the first occurrence of the key. However, the function does not check if the key exists before returning the index. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the key does not exist and the attacker tries to access the element at the returned index.
> ```cpp
	static int indexOf(const QExplicitlySharedDataPointer<QCborContainerPrivate> &o,
		const QString &key, bool *keyExists)
	{
		for (int i = 0, end = o->elements.length(); i != end; i += 2) {
			if (o->stringAt(i) == key) {
				*keyExists = true;
				return i;
			}
		}
		*keyExists = false;
		return -1;
	}
```
To fix this issue, the function should check if the key exists before returning the index.

4. CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation
> Line 1052: The operator-=() function does not handle negative values of j correctly. When j is negative, the function should subtract j from the current iterator's position, but instead it adds j to the current iterator's position.
> ```cpp
	QJsonObject::const_iterator &QJsonObject::const_iterator::operator-=(int j)
	{
		if (!o)
			return *this;
		j += i;
		i = qMax(j, 0);
		return *this;
	}
```
To fix this issue, the function should be changed to subtract j from the current iterator's position when j is negative.

5. CWE-707: Improper Neutralization
> Line 376: The insert() function does not properly neutralize the key if the value is QJsonValue::Undefined. This could allow an attacker to insert a key into the object that is not properly escaped and could lead to a cross-site scripting attack.
> ```cpp
    	if (value.t == QJsonValue::Undefined) {
    	    remove(key);
    	    return end();
    	}
    ```
To fix this issue, the function should properly escape the key before inserting it into the object.

6. CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards
> Line 1034: The operator++() function does not have a const_cast. This could lead to a compiler warning or error.
> ```cpp
	QJsonObject::const_iterator QJsonObject::const_iterator::operator++()
	{
		++i;
		return *this;
	}
```
To fix this issue, the function should be changed to have a const_cast.

7. CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
> Line 267: The keys() function does not handle the case where the object is empty. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the object is empty and the attacker tries to access its elements.
> ```cpp
	QStringList QJsonObject::keys() const
	{
		QStringList keys;
		if (!o)
			return keys;
		keys.reserve(o->elements.length() / 2);
		for (int i = 0, end = o->elements.length(); i != end; i += 2)
			keys.append(o->stringAt(i));
		return keys;
	}
```
To fix this issue, the function should handle the case where the object is empty by returning an empty list.

8. CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
> Line 1116: The detach2() function does not properly handle the case where the object is empty. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the object is empty and the attacker tries to access its elements.
> ```cpp
	bool QJsonObject::detach2(uint reserve)
	{
		if (!o)
			return true;
		o = QCborContainerPrivate::detach(o.data(), reserve ? reserve * 2 : o->elements.length());
		return o;
	}
```
To fix this issue, the function should handle the case where the object is empty by returning false.

9. CWE-435: Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities
> Line 296: The indexOf() function sets the keyExists pointer to true if the key exists. However, the function does not check if the keyExists pointer is nullptr before dereferencing it. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if the keyExists pointer is nullptr.
> ```cpp
	static int indexOf(const QExplicitlySharedDataPointer<QCborContainerPrivate> &o,
		const QString &key, bool *keyExists)
	{
		for (int i = 0, end = o->elements.length(); i != end; i += 2) {
			if (o->stringAt(i) == key) {
				*keyExists = true;
				return i;
			}
		}
		*keyExists = false;
		return -1;
	}
```
To fix this issue, the function should check if the keyExists pointer is nullptr before dereferencing it.
