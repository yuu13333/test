1.CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): No such defects are detected in the code. In this code snippet, there are no access control mechanisms or authorization checks.

2.CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities): No such defects are detected in the code. The code is internally consistent and does not contain any conflicting logic.

3.CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime): No such defects are detected in the code. The code does not allocate or release any resources, so there is no possibility of resource leaks or corruption.

4.CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): No such defects are detected in the code. The code performs basic arithmetic operations and time calculations correctly.

5.CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): Line 180: `this function will not attempt to obtain the current time and will use a value known to be in the past.`
This code does not obtain the current time and instead uses a value known to be in the past. This can lead to incorrect results if the deadline is used to calculate how long it is overdue.
         
6.CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): No such defects are detected in the code. The code does not perform any operations that could be considered security-sensitive, so there is no need for protection mechanisms.

7.CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): No such defects are detected in the code. The code uses correct comparisons for equality, inequality, and ordering.

8.CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): No such defects are detected in the code. The code does not handle any exceptional conditions, so there is no possibility of errors or crashes.

9.CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): No such defects are detected in the code. The code does not handle any input that could be considered malicious, so there is no need for neutralization.

10.CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): No such defects are detected in the code. The code adheres to generally accepted coding standards and best practices.
