The following security defects are detected in the code:
1. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: Line 107: The `token.extraInfo.token.toString()` is not properly sanitized or validated before displaying it in the UI, which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code or scripts into the application through specially crafted input.
2. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: Line 160: The `CPlusPlus::Icons::iconForType()` function is used to get an icon for a token, but it does not properly handle cases where the input token is invalid or malicious. An attacker could provide a specially crafted token that causes the function to crash or behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to a denial of service attack or other security issues.
3. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: Line 76: The `QTC_ASSERT` macro is used to check that `lexicalParentIndex < index`, but it does not properly handle the case where this condition is not met, which could lead to undefined behavior.
