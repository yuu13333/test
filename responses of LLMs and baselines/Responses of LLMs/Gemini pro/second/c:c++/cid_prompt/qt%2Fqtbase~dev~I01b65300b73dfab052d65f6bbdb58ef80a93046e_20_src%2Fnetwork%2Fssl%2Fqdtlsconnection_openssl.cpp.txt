**CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation**

- Line 317: The condition to check for a successful SSL connection is incorrect. It should be `result <= 0` instead of `result > 0`.

**CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure**

- Line 326: The code does not properly handle errors in the `q_SSL_connect` or `q_SSL_accept` functions. This could leave the connection in an insecure state.
- Line 410: The code does not properly handle errors in the `q_SSL_read` function. This could lead to data corruption or other security issues.
- Line 441: The code does not properly handle the case where the HMAC does not fit in the expected size. This could lead to a buffer overflow or other security issues.

**CWE-707: Improper Neutralization**

- Line 446: The `cookie` variable is not properly initialized before being used in `std::memcpy`. This could lead to a use-after-free or other memory corruption issues.
