**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
* **Line 51-59**: The QThread provides no access control to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or functions and does not protect against unauthorized state changes.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities**
* **Line 87**: The runnableReady condition variable is not protected by a lock, allowing multiple threads to access it concurrently, which could lead to data races and inconsistent behavior.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**
* **Line 113**: The runnable is deleted without checking if it has finished running, which could lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
* **Line 202**: New threads are created without checking if the thread pool has reached its maximum thread count, which could lead to resource exhaustion.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation**
* **Line 252**: The active thread count is calculated incorrectly, which could lead to incorrect decisions being made about thread management.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management**
* **Line 142**: The expiredThreads queue is not properly managed, which could lead to threads being expired prematurely or not being expired at all.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure**
* **Line 107**: Exceptions thrown in worker threads are not handled correctly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or program crashes.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison**
* **Line 208**: The comparePriority function uses a less-than comparison instead of a greater-than comparison, which could lead to incorrect thread scheduling.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**
* **Line 102**: Exceptions thrown in worker threads are not handled correctly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or program crashes.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization**
* **Line 107**: Exceptions thrown in worker threads are not handled correctly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or program crashes.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards**
* **Line 43**: The #include "qthreadpool.h" directive is missing, which could lead to compilation errors.
