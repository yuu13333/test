There are four security defects in the code you provided:

1. CWE-284: Improper Access Control
CWE-284: Improper Access Control
Line 191:
```
emitError(tr("Cannot establish SSH connection: Control process failed to start: %1")
.arg(d->fullProcessError()));
```
The error message is displayed without proper validation, allowing a potential attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system by providing a crafted error message.

2. CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
Line 221:
```
QTimer::singleShot(0, this, &SshConnection::doConnectToHost);
```
The `QTimer::singleShot()` function is called with a timeout value of 0, which may cause the `doConnectToHost()` function to be executed before the `connectToHost()` function has completed. This could lead to a race condition where the `doConnectToHost()` function attempts to access the `d->connParams` member variable before it has been properly initialized.

3. CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison
Line 273:
```
if (data.size() != 3) {
```
The code checks if the size of the `data` array is not equal to 3, but it should check if the size is equal to 3 to ensure that the array contains the expected number of elements.

4. CWE-707: Improper Neutralization
Line 175:
```
const auto socketFileChecker = [this] {
```
The lambda function `socketFileChecker` is defined as a capture-by-reference lambda, which means it captures the `this` pointer by reference. This can lead to memory leaks if the lambda function is stored in a long-lived object, as the `this` pointer will never be released.
