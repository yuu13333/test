CWE-682 (incorrect calculation); CWE-691 (insufficient control flow management); CWE-693 (protection mechanism failure)
The function `qt_doubleToAscii` does not properly handle special numbers (such as NaN, infinity, and negative zero) before calling `DoubleToAscii`. As a result, the function may fail to correctly convert these numbers to ASCII, leading to incorrect calculations or other unexpected behavior.
Solution: The function can detect and handle the special numbers before calling `DoubleToAscii`, ensuring more accurate conversion and minimizing the potential for errors.
