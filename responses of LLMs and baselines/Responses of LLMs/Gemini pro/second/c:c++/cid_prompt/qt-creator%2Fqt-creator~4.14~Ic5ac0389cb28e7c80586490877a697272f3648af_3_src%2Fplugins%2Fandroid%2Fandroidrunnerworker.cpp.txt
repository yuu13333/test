## CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)
- **Line Number**: 399
- **Description**: Function `adbKill` may not be able to kill the process if `output == QString::number(m_processPID)` is false.

## CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
- **Line Number**: 370
- **Description**: In case GDB server upload failed, `cleanup` scope guard is used, but the debug server may not be properly cleaned up.

## CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
- **Line Number**: 774
- **Description**: `removeForwardPort` function may not properly remove the forward port if `forward` is not found in `string` in case-insensitive comparison.

## CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
- **Line Number**: 136
- **Description**: Function `findProcessPID` uses a pre-Nougat selector that needs to be separated from the Nougat selector, or use the Nougat selector if the API level is >= 24. Additionally, a check for device serial number should also be added to the selector.

## CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)
- **Line Number**: 136
- **Description**: Function `findProcessPID` does not handle the case where `selector` is empty, which could lead to an empty command being executed.

## CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
- **Line Number**: 367
- **Description**: Failure to handle absence of `tempDebugServerPath` in the cleanup scope guard.

## CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)

- **Description**: The value of `pid` is extracted from `output` without proper handling of cases where the output is empty or does not contain a valid PID.

## CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
- **Line Number**: 136
- **Description**: Function `findProcessPID` uses a single argument selector, but the pre-Nougat and Nougat selectors use different syntax. The function should use a selector that is appropriate for the API level of the device.
