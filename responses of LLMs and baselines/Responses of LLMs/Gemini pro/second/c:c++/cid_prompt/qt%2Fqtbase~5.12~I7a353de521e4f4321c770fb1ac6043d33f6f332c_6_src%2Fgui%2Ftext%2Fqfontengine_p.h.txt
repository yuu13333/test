The following security defects are identified:
1. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: In line 232, the function `lineThickness()` returns a fixed value of 0, which may not always be correct, resulting in incorrect line thickness calculations.
2. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: In line 248, the `glyphMargin` function returns a fixed value of 2 for `Format_A32` format, but this value may not be correct for all cases, leading to incorrect glyph margin calculations.
