**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): Line 145**

In the `decodePem` function, the code is vulnerable to an incorrect comparison. Specifically, the code checks if `pem` is empty before attempting to decode it. However, this check is insufficient because it does not account for the possibility that `pem` contains whitespace characters. As a result, an attacker could provide a PEM-encoded key that contains whitespace characters, which would cause the code to skip the decoding process and potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

**Solution:**

```
if (pem.trimmed().isEmpty())
    return;
```

This correction ensures that the code only skips the decoding process if `pem` is truly empty or contains only whitespace characters and it will perform decoding if there is any non-whitespace character content in `pem`.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): Line 157**

In the `decodePem` function, the code is vulnerable to a protection mechanism failure. Specifically, the code relies on the `RSA *result` and `DSA *result` variables to indicate whether the decoding process was successful. However, these variables are not properly checked before being used to determine whether to set the `isNull` flag. As a result, an attacker could provide a malformed PEM-encoded key that causes these variables to be set to NULL, which would cause the `isNull` flag to be set incorrectly and potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

**Solution:**

```
if (!rsa || rsa != result)
    return;
```

```
if (!dsa || dsa != result)
    return;
```

These additions ensure that the `isNull` flag is only set if the decoding process was successful.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): Lines 260 and 269**

In the `toPem` function, the code is vulnerable to improper neutralization. Specifically, the code uses the passphrase specified by the user to encrypt the private key. However, the passphrase is not properly validated before being used, which could allow an attacker to provide a malicious passphrase that could be used to compromise the private key.

**Solution:**

```
if (!fail && !passPhrase.isEmpty())
    pem.prepend(QByteArray("--") + QSslSocket::pemLine() + "Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED" + QSslSocket::pemLine());
```

This correction ensures that the passphrase is only used to encrypt the private key if it is not empty.
