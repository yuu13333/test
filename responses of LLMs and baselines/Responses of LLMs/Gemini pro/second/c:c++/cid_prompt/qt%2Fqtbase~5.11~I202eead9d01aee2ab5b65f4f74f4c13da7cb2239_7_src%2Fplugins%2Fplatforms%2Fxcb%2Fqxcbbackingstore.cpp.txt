The code above has the following security defects:

1. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): The code doesn't correctly calculate the size of the shared memory segment. The size of the shared memory segment is calculated as the size of the image data, which can be larger than the actual size of the shared memory segment. This can lead to a buffer overflow.
2. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): The code does not properly handle errors when creating the shared memory segment. If the shared memory segment cannot be created, the code does not properly handle the error and can lead to a denial of service.
3. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): The code incorrectly compares the depth of the XCB image to the depth of the image. This can lead to incorrect results and can cause the program to crash.
4. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): The code does not properly handle errors when attaching the shared memory segment to the XCB connection. If the shared memory segment cannot be attached, the code does not properly handle the error and can lead to a denial of service.
5. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): The code does not properly neutralize the input when creating the XCB image. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the input is not properly validated.
6. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): The code does not adhere to coding standards. This can make the code difficult to read and maintain, and can lead to errors.

To fix the security defects, the following changes should be made to the code:

1. The size of the shared memory segment should be calculated correctly.
2. The code should properly handle errors when creating the shared memory segment.
3. The code should correctly compare the depth of the XCB image to the depth of the image.
4. The code should properly handle errors when attaching the shared memory segment to the XCB connection.
5. The code should properly neutralize the input when creating the XCB image.
6. The code should adhere to coding standards.
