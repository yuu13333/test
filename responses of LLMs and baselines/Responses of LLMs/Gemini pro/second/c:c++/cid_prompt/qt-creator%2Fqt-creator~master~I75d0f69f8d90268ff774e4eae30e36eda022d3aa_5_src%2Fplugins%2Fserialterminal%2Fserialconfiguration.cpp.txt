The following security defects are detected in the code:

1.**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - Line 189: `writeData` function does not perform any checks on the data being written to the serial port, which could allow an attacker to send arbitrary data to the device.

2.**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
   - Line 177: `baudRateText` function does not perform any checks on the baud rate value, which could allow an attacker to set an invalid baud rate and cause the serial port to malfunction.

3.**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
   - Line 208: `handleError` function does not handle the case where the serial port is not open, which could cause an exception to be thrown.

4.**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
   - The code does not follow the Qt coding standards, which could make it more difficult to read and maintain.
