The following security defects are identified:

1. **CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**
   - **Line 324** The program does not handle the case where setting the enabled flag to the same value does not result in data change. This may lead to unexpected behavior or an infinite loop.

   **Solution:** 
   ```cpp
   if (setting->m_enabled != value.toBool() && 
       setting->set_enabled(value.toBool())) {
       emit dataChanged(index, index, { Qt::CheckStateRole });
   }
   ```

2. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
   - **Line 302** Boundary check error, where index can be equal to the size of the m_settings after the removeRows function is called.
   - **Line 314** Boundary check error, where index can be equal to the size of the m_settings after the insertRows function is called.

   **Solution:**
   ```cpp
   if (row < int(m_settings.size())
   ```
   ```cpp
   if (row < m_settings.size()
   ```
