**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
* Not detected. The code uses Qt's authentication framework to manage access control.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
* Line 181: `int columnCount(const QModelIndex &parent = QModelIndex()) const override`: This override does not check if the parent is valid, which could lead to incorrect column count.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
* Not detected. Qt handles memory management, and no explicit resource management is required.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
* Not detected. Calculations are performed using Qt's built-in functions.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
* Not detected. Control flow is managed using Qt's event system.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
* Not detected. The code does not implement any explicit protection mechanisms.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
* Not detected. Comparisons are performed using Qt's comparison operators.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
* Not detected. The code does not handle any exceptional conditions.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
* Not detected. User input is not neutralized or validated.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
* Line 101: `addEntries(const QList<LocatorFilterEntry> &entries)`: This function should const-qualify its parameters.

**Solution:**

* Line 181: `int columnCount(const QModelIndex &parent = QModelIndex()) const override`: Check if `parent` is valid before returning the column count.
* Line 101: `addEntries(const QList<LocatorFilterEntry> &entries)`: Define the function as `void addEntries(const QList<LocatorFilterEntry> &entries) const`.
