The following security defects are found in the code:
1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** Line 81: The function `isHostExcluded` does not check if the provided `dict` parameter is valid before accessing its members, which could lead to a crash if the parameter is `nullptr`.
Solution: Add a check to ensure that the `dict` parameter is not `nullptr` before accessing its members.

2. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):** Line 104: The variable `size` is not checked for validity before being used in the subsequent loop. This could lead to undefined behavior if `size` is negative or zero.
Solution: Add a check to ensure that `size` is positive before using it in the loop.

3. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** Line 191: The function `proxyAutoConfigCallback` does not check if the `proxylist` or `error` parameters are `nullptr` before accessing their members. This could lead to a crash if either parameter is `nullptr`.
Solution: Add checks to ensure that `proxylist` and `error` are not `nullptr` before accessing their members.

4. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** Line 230: The function `macQueryInternal` does not check if the `cfPacLocation` parameter is `nullptr` before accessing its members. This could lead to a crash if the parameter is `nullptr`.
Solution: Add a check to ensure that `cfPacLocation` is not `nullptr` before accessing its members.

5. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** Line 241: The function `macQueryInternal` does not check if the `targetURL` parameter is `nullptr` before accessing its members. This could lead to a crash if the parameter is `nullptr`.
Solution: Add a check to ensure that `targetURL` is not `nullptr` before accessing its members.

6. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):** Line 235: The function `macQueryInternal` does not properly neutralize the input to the `CFURLCreateWithBytes` function. This could allow an attacker to provide specially crafted input that results in a buffer overflow.
Solution: Use a safe string handling function to neutralize the input before passing it to `CFURLCreateWithBytes`.
