**CWE-435: Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities**

In the `openProject` method, the project is opened asynchronously. However, the code immediately checks if the model manager is aware of the project, which may not be the case yet. This can lead to false negatives.
**Solution:** Use a signal or a callback to be notified when the model manager is aware of the project.

**CWE-707: Improper Neutralization**

The `applySubstitutions` function replaces `${PWD}` with the absolute path of the directory containing the batch file. However, it does not properly neutralize the special characters in the path, which could lead to command injection attacks.
**Solution:** Use a proper path sanitization function to neutralize the special characters in the path.

**CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards**

The code uses a lot of magic numbers and hard-coded values, which makes it difficult to read and maintain.
**Solution:** Use meaningful names for constants and variables, and move hard-coded values to configuration files or environment variables.
