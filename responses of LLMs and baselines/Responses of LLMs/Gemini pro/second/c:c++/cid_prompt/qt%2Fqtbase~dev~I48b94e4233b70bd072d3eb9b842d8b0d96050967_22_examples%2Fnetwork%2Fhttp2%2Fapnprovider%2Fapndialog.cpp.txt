The code contains a potential security defect in terms of:

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

Specifically, the code does not properly handle the memory allocation for the `Ui::ApnDialog` object in the constructor. The `new` operator is used to allocate memory for the object, but there is no corresponding `delete` statement to release the memory when the object is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, which can degrade the performance of the application and, in some cases, can lead to a denial of service attack.

To fix this, the code should be modified to include a corresponding `delete` statement to release the memory when the `Ui::ApnDialog` object is no longer needed. For example:

```cpp
ApnDialog::~ApnDialog()
{
    delete ui;
}
```
