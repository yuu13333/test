1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - **Line 100-107:** The `onToolChainRemoved` slot is connected to the `finished` signal of a `QFutureWatcher`. The slot can be called with any `QFutureWatcher` object, even if it was not created by this class. This could allow an attacker to trigger the removal of a toolchain and cause the project update to fail.
   - **Solution**: Replace the `finished` signal with a custom signal that is emitted only when the `QFutureWatcher` object created by this class reports a finished status.
   
2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
   - **Line 96-112:** The `QFutureWatcher` objects for extra compilers are not properly handled. If the extra compiler run is canceled, the `QFutureWatcher` will not be deleted and will continue to hold a reference to the extra compiler object. This could lead to memory leaks.
   - **Solution**: The `QFutureWatcher` objects should be deleted when the extra compiler run is canceled.
   
3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - **Line 115-123:** The `m_projectUpdateFutureInterface` object is not properly handled. If the project update is canceled, the `m_projectUpdateFutureInterface` object will not be reset and will continue to hold a reference to the project update object. This could lead to memory leaks.
   - **Solution**: The `m_projectUpdateFutureInterface` object should be reset when the project update is canceled.
   
4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
   - **Line 117:** The `setProgressRange` method is called with an incorrect range. The range should be from 0 to the total number of extra compilers plus 1 (for the project info generator).
   - **Solution**: Change the range to `0, m_extraCompilersFutureWatchers.size() + 2`
   
5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
   - **Line 128:** The `reportFinished` method is called without checking if the future is running. This could cause the future to be reported as finished even if it is not.
   - **Solution**: Add a check to ensure that the future is running before calling `reportFinished`.
   
6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
   - **Line 148-149:** The `disconnect` method is called without checking if the signal is connected. This could cause the signal to be disconnected even if it is not connected.
   - **Solution**: Add a check to ensure that the signal is connected before calling `disconnect`.
   
7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
   - **Line 151:** The `isCanceled` method is called on the `QFutureWatcher` object without checking if the future has finished. This could cause the future to be reported as canceled even if it has not finished.
   - **Solution**: Add a check to ensure that the future has finished before calling `isCanceled`.
   
8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
   - **Line 160:** The `isEmpty` method is called on the `m_extraCompilersFutureWatchers` list without checking if the list is null. This could cause the program to crash if the list is null.
   - **Solution**: Add a check to ensure that the list is not null before calling `isEmpty`.
   
9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
   - **Line 128:** The `reportFinished` method is called without neutralizing the future. This could allow the future to be reused even after it has been reported as finished.
   - **Solution**: Neutralize the future by calling `setFuture({})` on the `QFutureWatcher` object.
   
10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
   - **Line 184:** The `setObjectName` method should not be called on an object that has not been created with `new`.
   - **Solution**: Create the object with `new` before calling `setObjectName`.
