The code contains the following security defects:
1. **Line 123-125: CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - The code releases the OpenSSL context (sslContext->ctx) without checking if it is valid, which can lead to memory leaks and undefined behavior.

2. **Line 243-245: CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
   - The code does not handle the case where `q_d2i_DHparams` returns `NULL`, which can lead to a null pointer dereference.
