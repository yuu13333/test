**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
Line 104:
The function addWindow does not perform any access control checks before modifying the m_compositedWindows map. This could allow an attacker to add arbitrary windows to the compositor, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other security issues.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
Line 184:
The function setParent does not check if the parent window is already set for the specified child window, which could lead to multiple parent windows being assigned to the same child window. This could cause unexpected behavior or crashes.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
Line 85:
The function destroy releases the QOpenGLContext without making it current, which could leave the context in an invalid state and lead to memory leaks or other issues.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
Line 423:
The function dpiScaled does not take into account the device pixel ratio of the screen, which could lead to incorrect scaling calculations and visual artifacts.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
Line 353:
The function requestUpdate does not handle the case where the m_requestAnimationFrameId is already set, which could lead to multiple update requests being sent and potentially cause performance issues or race conditions.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
Line 353:
The function requestUpdate does not use a lock to protect the m_requestAnimationFrameId variable, which could lead to data races and unpredictable behavior.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
Line 339:
The function requestUpdateWindow does not check if the specified window is already registered for update requests, which could lead to duplicate requests being sent and potentially cause performance issues or race conditions.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
Line 354:
The function requestUpdate does not handle the case where emscripten_request_animation_frame fails, which could leave the compositor in an inconsistent state and lead to unexpected behavior.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
Line 551:
The function cachedPixmapFromXPM does not properly neutralize the input XPM data, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the application by providing a specially crafted XPM file.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
Line 551:
The function cachedPixmapFromXPM does not use a consistent naming convention for local variables, which can make the code difficult to read and maintain.
