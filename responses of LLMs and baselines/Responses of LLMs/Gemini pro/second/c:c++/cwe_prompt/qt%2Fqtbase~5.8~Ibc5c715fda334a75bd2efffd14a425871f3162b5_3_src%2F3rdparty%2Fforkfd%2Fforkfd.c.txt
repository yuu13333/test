The following security defects are detected in the code:

CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer: Line 185. The program does not check if the array allocated in line 181 is null before dereferencing it on line 185. This could lead to segmentation fault.

CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'): Line 196. The program does not check the length of the string before copying it to a buffer in line 196, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

CWE-415: Double Free: Line 266. The program frees the same memory twice in line 266 and line 267, which could lead to memory corruption.

CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference: Line 322. The program dereferences a pointer to an array without checking if it is initialized to a non-null value, which could lead to segmentation fault.

CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference: Line 331. The program dereferences a pointer to an array without checking if it is initialized to a non-null value, which could lead to segmentation fault.

CWE-758: Use of Incorrectly Locked Function: Line 475. The program uses a function that is not thread-safe (sigaction) without protecting it from concurrent access, which could lead to race conditions and unpredictable behavior.

CWE-90: Use of Uninitialized Variable: Line 312. The program uses an uninitialized variable (info) in line 312, which could lead to undefined behavior.

CWE-90: Use of Uninitialized Variable: Line 313. The program uses an uninitialized variable (payload) in line 313, which could lead to undefined behavior.
