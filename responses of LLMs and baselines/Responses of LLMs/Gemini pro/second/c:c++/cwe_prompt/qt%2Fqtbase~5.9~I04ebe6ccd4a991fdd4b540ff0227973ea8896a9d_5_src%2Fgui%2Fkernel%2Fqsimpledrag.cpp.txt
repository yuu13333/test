**CWE-191: Integer Overflow or Wraparound** (Line 291)

The `canDrop` field is a boolean field that can only take values 0 or 1. However, the if statement checks if the event loop is running, which is triggered by `exitDndEventLoop`, which can be called multiple times, thereby causing the value of `canDrop` to exceed 1, leading to an integer overflow.


**CWE-190: Integer Underflow or Wraparound** (Line 291)

Similar to CWE-191, the `canDrop` field is a boolean field that can only take values 0 or 1. However, the if statement checks if the event loop is running, which is triggered by `exitDndEventLoop`, which can be called multiple times, thereby causing the value of `canDrop` to become negative, leading to an integer underflow.

**CWE-399: Resource Exhaustion ("Resource Starvation")** (Line 291)

The if statement checks if the event loop is running, which is triggered by `exitDndEventLoop`, which can be called multiple times. This can lead to the event loop being restarted indefinitely, resulting in a resource exhaustion attack.

**CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference** (Line 321)

The `if` statement checks if the `cursor` is not `nullptr`, but the subsequent code assumes that the `cursor` is not `nullptr` and attempts to access its `shape` field, which can lead to a null pointer dereference if the `cursor` is actually `nullptr`.

**Remediation**

**CWE-191: Integer Overflow or Wraparound** (Line 291)
* The condition should be changed to `!canDrop` to avoid the integer overflow.

**CWE-190: Integer Underflow or Wraparound** (Line 291)
* The condition should be changed to `!canDrop` to avoid the integer underflow.

**CWE-399: Resource Exhaustion ("Resource Starvation")** (Line 291)
* Introduce a counter to limit the number of times `exitDndEventLoop` can be called.

**CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference** (Line 321)
* Add a check for `cursor != nullptr` before accessing its `shape` field.
