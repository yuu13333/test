1: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
2: Line 222: The `QGuiApplication::clipboard()->mimeData()` function does not perform proper input validation, which could allow an attacker to provide malicious data that could lead to unexpected behavior or a crash.
3: **Solution:** Use a more restrictive input validation mechanism, such as a whitelist or blacklist, to ensure that only valid data is accepted.

4: CWE-116: Buffer Overflow
5: Line 290: The `QStringList coords = strMinPos.split(":", QString::SkipEmptyParts);` function does not perform proper bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the `strMinPos` string contains more than two colons.
6: **Solution:** Use a more robust string splitting function that performs proper bounds checking or manually check the number of colons in the `strMinPos` string before splitting it.
