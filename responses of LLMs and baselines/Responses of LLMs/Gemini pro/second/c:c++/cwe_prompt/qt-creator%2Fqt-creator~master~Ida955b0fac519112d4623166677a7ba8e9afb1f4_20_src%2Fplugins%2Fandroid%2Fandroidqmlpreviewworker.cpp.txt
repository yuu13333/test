The following security defects are found in the code:

CWE-704 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release): 
In the `stopPreviewApp()` method, the resource `m_viewerPid` is not properly released. This could lead to a resource leak.

**Solution**: The `m_viewerPid` should be properly released when the application is stopped. This can be done by setting it to `-1` or by using a `QTemporaryFile` to store the PID and deleting the file when the application is stopped.

CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:
In the `runPreviewApp()` method, the user-supplied input `transfer.mainQmlFile.baseName()` is not properly neutralized before being used in a command that is executed on the device. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Solution**: The user-supplied input should be properly neutralized before being used in the command. This can be done by using a white-list of allowed characters or by escaping the input.

CWE-476: Null Pointer Dereference:
In the `prepareUpload()` method, the `mainQmlFile` member of the `transfer` object is dereferenced without first checking if it is null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference.

**Solution**: The `mainQmlFile` member should be checked for null before it is dereferenced. This can be done using the `isNull()` method.

CWE-264: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls:
In the `elevateAdb()` method, the `runAdbCommand()` function is called with the `root` argument, which allows the application to gain root privileges on the device. This could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges and compromise the device.

**Solution**: The `root` argument should not be used in the `runAdbCommand()` function. Instead, the application should use the `adb` command with the `-d` flag to run commands as a specific user.

CWE-391: Uncontrolled Recursion:
In the `start()` method, the `QtConcurrent::run()` function is called in a loop. This could lead to uncontrolled recursion and a stack overflow.

**Solution**: The `QtConcurrent::run()` function should not be called in a loop. Instead, the application should use a `QTimer` to periodically check if the application is still running and if not, stop the application.
