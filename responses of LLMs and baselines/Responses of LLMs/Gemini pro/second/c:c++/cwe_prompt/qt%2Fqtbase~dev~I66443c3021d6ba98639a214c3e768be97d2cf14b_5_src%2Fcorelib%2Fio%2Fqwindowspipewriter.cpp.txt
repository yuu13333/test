**CWE-78** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
Line 208: The code does not properly neutralize the special character '`' in the command string. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system, leading to privilege escalation or data leakage.

**Mitigation:**
Use a safer method to execute the command, such as the `QProcess` class, which provides a mechanism to escape special characters.

**CWE-119** Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
Line 164: The code does not check if the number of bytes to write exceeds the size of the buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

**Mitigation:**
Add a check to ensure that the number of bytes to write is within the bounds of the buffer.


**CWE-284** Improper Access Control
Line 132: The code checks if `lastError` is not equal to `ERROR_SUCCESS` before performing write operations. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access to the pipe. An attacker could modify the `lastError` variable to bypass this check and gain access to the pipe.

**Mitigation:**
Implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can write to the pipe.
