1. **CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**
   - CWE-119 is a weakness that occurs when a program can access memory outside the bounds of a buffer. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as program crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Line Number:** 163-169
   - **Solution:** Use `std::aligned_alloc` or `posix_memalign` to allocate memory with the specified alignment.
   
2. **CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound**
   - CWE-190 is a weakness that occurs when an integer value overflows or wraps around, leading to unexpected behavior.
   - **Line Number:** 196-197
   - **Solution:** Use a library function that checks for integer overflow, such as `std::numeric_limits<qsizetype>::max()`.
