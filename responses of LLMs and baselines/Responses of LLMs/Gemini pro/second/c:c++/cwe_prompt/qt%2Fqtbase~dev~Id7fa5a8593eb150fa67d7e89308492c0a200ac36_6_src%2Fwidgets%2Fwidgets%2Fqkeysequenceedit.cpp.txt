**CWE-117: Improper Restriction of Excessive Data Transmission**
**Line 70:**
```cpp
lineEdit->setPlaceholderText(QKeySequenceEdit::tr("Press shortcut"));
```
Line 70 sets the placeholder text of the line edit to the translated string "Press shortcut". However, the use of `QKeySequenceEdit::tr()` is not necessary for this purpose. The `tr()` function is used for translating strings that are displayed to the user and should be used with care. In this case, the placeholder text is not intended to be translated, and it would be more appropriate to use the `QString` constructor directly to avoid the risk of improper data transmission.

**Solution:**
Replace line 70 with:
```cpp
lineEdit->setPlaceholderText(QString("Press shortcut"));
```

**CWE-80: Execution of Unintended Code**
**Line 284:**
```cpp
QList<int> possibleKeys = QKeyMapper::possibleKeys(e);
```
Line 284 retrieves a list of possible keys for the given event using `QKeyMapper::possibleKeys(e)`. This function returns a list of possible keys that could be associated with the event, based on the system's keyboard layout. However, this list may include keys that are not intended to be used as shortcuts, such as modifier keys or special function keys. By using this list without proper validation, the code becomes susceptible to the execution of unintended code if a user presses one of these keys while attempting to set a shortcut.

**Solution:**
Filter the list of possible keys to exclude keys that are not intended to be used as shortcuts. This can be done by checking the `flags()` property of each key to ensure that it is a valid key for a shortcut. For example:
```cpp
QList<int> possibleKeys = QKeyMapper::possibleKeys(e);
possibleKeys = possibleKeys.filter([](int key) { return key & Qt::Key_ModifierMask == 0; });
```
