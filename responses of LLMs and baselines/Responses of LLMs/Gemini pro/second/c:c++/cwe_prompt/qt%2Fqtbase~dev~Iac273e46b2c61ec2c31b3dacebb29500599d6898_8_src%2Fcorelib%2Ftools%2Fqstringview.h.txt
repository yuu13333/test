**CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow**

The call to `length(str)` uses `size_t`, which is an unsigned integer type prone to overflow for large input string sizes. If the input string is very large, it can cause an overflow and return a value that is smaller than the actual length of the string, leading to a buffer overflow when accessing the string.

To fix this, use a signed integer type such as `ptrdiff_t` or `int` for the length calculation. These types can handle negative values and will return an error if the length of the string exceeds the maximum representable value for the type.

**CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound**

The assignment of `m_size` and `m_data` can result in an integer overflow if the length of `str` is greater than the maximum value of `size_t`. This can lead to incorrect behavior and potential buffer overflows.

To fix this, use a signed integer type such as `ptrdiff_t` or `int` for the length calculation and ensure that the value is within the valid range for `size_t` before assigning it to `m_size`.

**Line 140:**

**CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound**

Similar to the previous issue, the assignment of `m_size` can result in an integer overflow if the length of `str` is greater than the maximum value of `size_t`.

To fix this, use a signed integer type such as `ptrdiff_t` or `int` for the length calculation and ensure that the value is within the valid range for `size_t` before assigning it to `m_size`.

**Line 264:**

**CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound**

The cast from `size()` to `int` is not checked for overflow, which can lead to incorrect behavior or crashes if `size()` exceeds the maximum value of `int`.

To fix this, ensure that `size()` is within the valid range for `int` before performing the cast.
