**Security Defects Identified:**

1. **Insecure Temporary File Creation (CWE-306):**
    - Line 77: The code creates a temporary directory and file name using `Utils::TemporaryDirectory::masterDirectoryPath()`, which does not ensure the directory is secured from unauthorized access or modification.
    - **Solution:** Use a dedicated and secure directory for storing temporary files, such as a directory within the application's sandbox or a directory protected by access control lists (ACLs).

2. **Insufficient File Permissions (CWE-732):**
    - Line 111: The code listens for incoming connections on a local socket using `m_server->listen(socketName)`. The socket is created using the default constructor, which sets the permissions to the current user's umask.
    - **Solution:** Explicitly set appropriate file permissions on the local socket, such as restricting access to only the current user or group.

3. **Unprotected Process Launcher (CWE-882):**
    - Line 135: The code starts a new process using `m_process->start(launcherFilePath(), QStringList(m_server->fullServerName()))`. The "launcherFilePath" is user-supplied, opening the possibility of launching an arbitrary executable.
    - **Solution:** Implement proper input validation to ensure the "launcherFilePath" is valid and comes from a trusted source. Consider using a sandbox to limit the privileges of the launched process.

4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Error Message (CWE-79):**
    - Line 164: The code constructs an error message using `QCoreApplication::translate("Utils::LauncherSocket", ...)`. The message can be influenced by user-supplied input, potentially leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
    - **Solution:** Escape or sanitize user-supplied input before passing it to `QCoreApplication::translate()`.

5. **Insufficient Logging and Error Handling (CWE-276):**
    - Line 178: The code does not handle errors related to reading stderr from the launched process.
    - **Solution:** Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to capture and report any errors encountered while reading stderr.

6. **Lack of Input Validation (CWE-20):**
    - Line 222: The code sets the path to the launcher based on user-supplied input without any validation.
    - **Solution:** Validate the input path to ensure it is a valid and trusted location.
