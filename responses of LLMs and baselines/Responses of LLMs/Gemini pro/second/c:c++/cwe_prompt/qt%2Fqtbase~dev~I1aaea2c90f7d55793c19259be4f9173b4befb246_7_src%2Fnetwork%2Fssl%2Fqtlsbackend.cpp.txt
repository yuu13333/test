The code is missing the implementation for `createKey`. As the documentation states: "This method is expected to return a dynamically-allocated instance of an implementation-specific type, inheriting from the class QTlsPrivate::TlsKey."

The following code can be added to the end of the file to fix the issue:

```cpp
#if QT_CONFIG(ssl)
QT_PRIVATE_EXPORT QTlsPrivate::TlsKey *QTlsBackend::createKey() const
{
    REPORT_MISSING_SUPPORT("QTlsBackend::createKey");
    return nullptr;
}
#endif
```
