No security defects are detected in the code.

This code was processed line by line to verify each statement and logic in order to identify any potential security defects. Each statement was checked for potential overflows and boundary conditions as well as for logic errors or security vulnerabilities. The code uses Qt's QPixmapCache class, which is a thread-safe cache for pixmaps (QPixmap) in Qt and is used to store temporary pixmaps that are expensive to generate. The code follows best practices and handles the caching of pixmaps securely.
