1. **CWE-20: Insufficient Logging**
   - Line 53: The code does not log any messages or events that occur during the execution of the program. This makes it difficult to troubleshoot errors or identify security incidents.
   - Solution: Add logging statements throughout the code to log important events and errors.

2. **CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**
   - Line 54: The code compares the category name to the string "driver.usb" using `qstrcmp`. This function is not safe to use because it does not handle null-terminated strings correctly and may lead to a buffer overflow.
   - Solution: Use `strcmp` instead of `qstrcmp` to compare strings.
