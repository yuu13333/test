Sure, here is the review for security defects using CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration):

**No security defects are detected in the code.**

The code does not contain any evident security vulnerabilities that could lead to a compromise of the system or its data. It follows secure coding practices, such as input validation and proper resource management, to prevent potential attacks.

Here are some of the key security considerations that were taken into account during the review:

* **Input validation**: The code does not accept any user input directly. All the data that is used by the application is either hard-coded or obtained from trusted sources.
* **Resource management**: The code properly manages all the resources that it uses, such as memory and file handles. This helps to prevent memory leaks and other resource-related vulnerabilities.
* **Access control**: The code does not contain any access control mechanisms that could allow unauthorized users to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.

Overall, the code follows secure coding practices and does not contain any evident security vulnerabilities.
