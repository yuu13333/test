**CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs, Error, and Other Messages**

**Description:** An application does not neutralize special elements that could be interpreted as markup or script in a log or error message, enabling an attacker to inject additional markup or script into the output.

**Example:**

The code snippet below does not neutralize special elements in a log message, enabling an attacker to inject additional markup or script into the output:

```
// C code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char* input = "This is an example string";
    // The input is not sanitized, so an attacker could provide a crafted
    // string that contains special characters that could be interpreted as
    // markup or script.
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s", input);
    return 0;
}
```

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted string that contains special characters, such as angle brackets, to inject additional markup or script into the log message. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Recommendation:**

To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should neutralize special elements in the input string before outputting it to the log or error message. This can be done using a function that replaces or removes special characters from the string. For example, the following code uses the `htmlspecialchars` function to neutralize special characters in the input string:

```
// C code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char* input = "This is an example string";
    // The input is sanitized using the htmlspecialchars function to
    // replace special characters with their HTML entities.
    char* sanitized_input = htmlspecialchars(input, strlen(input));
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s", sanitized_input);
    return 0;
}
```

By neutralizing special elements in the input string before outputting it to the log or error message, the application can prevent attackers from injecting additional markup or script into the output.
