The following security defects are detected in the code:

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation):
Line 173: The function `read` does not validate the input pointer `data` and its size `maxlen` before copying data to it. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `maxlen` is greater than the actual number of available bytes in the buffer, resulting in undefined behavior or a crash.

CWE-416 (Use After Free):
Line 181: The code assumes that the internal buffer `readBuffer` will always contain at least one character if `actualReadBufferSize` is greater than 0. However, it does not handle the case where the buffer may have been cleared or modified concurrently, potentially leading to accessing freed memory and undefined behavior.

CWE-200 (Information Exposure):
Line 205: The function `canReadLine` does not check if the user has the necessary permissions to read from the pipe, potentially exposing sensitive information if the pipe is accessible to other processes or users.
