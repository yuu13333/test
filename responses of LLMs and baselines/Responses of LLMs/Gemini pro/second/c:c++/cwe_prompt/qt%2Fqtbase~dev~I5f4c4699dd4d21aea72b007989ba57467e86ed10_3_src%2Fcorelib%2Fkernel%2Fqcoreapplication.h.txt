Line 83-85: CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer): The constructor is called with a variable number of parameters, but the final parameter does not have a default value. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the user passes in too many parameters. The function should be fixed to ensure that the final parameter always has a default value.

Line 144: CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm): The function `translate` uses a deprecated encoding. This could lead to security issues, as the encoding may not be secure. The function should be fixed to use a more secure encoding.

Line 203: CWE-806 (Insecure Comparison with `true`): The function `sendEvent` compares the value of the `self` pointer to `true` instead of `false`. This could lead to a security issue, as the function will always return true. The function should be fixed to compare the value of the `self` pointer to `false`.
