CWE-618: Vulnerable: The code does not take into consideration that hostname of the compute node is dependent on the cell that it belongs to. This can lead to security concern where a host could be accessible from multiple cells. If one of the cell is compromised then the host can be used to elevate privileges in other cells.
CWE-476: Vulnerable: The code does not verify if the resize is allowed before applying the resize.

Fix: Ensure that the code performs checks to ensure that the resize is allowed before applying the resize and validate that servers are in the correct cells before performing cross-cell operations.
