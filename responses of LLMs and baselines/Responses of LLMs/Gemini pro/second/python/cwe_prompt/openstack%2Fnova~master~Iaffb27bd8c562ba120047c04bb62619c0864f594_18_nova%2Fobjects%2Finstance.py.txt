This code has been reviewed and found to contain a CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability due to the following reason:

The conditional statement in the following code may inadvertently pass data into the database without filtering:

```python
    def _get_count_by_vm_state_in_db(context, project_id, user_id, vm_state):
        return context.session.query(models.Instance.id).\
            filter_by(deleted=0).\
            filter_by(project_id=project_id).\
            filter_by(user_id=user_id).\
            filter_by(vm_state=vm_state).\
            count()
```
The variables `project_id`, `user_id` and `vm_state` are not validated before being passed into the query. This could allow an attacker to pass in arbitrary data into the database.

To resolve this issue, it is recommended to either use a parameterized query or to validate the input before passing it into the query. For example, the following code would use a parameterized query:

```python
    def _get_count_by_vm_state_in_db(context, project_id, user_id, vm_state):
        return context.session.query(models.Instance.id).\
            filter_by(deleted=0).\
            filter_by(project_id=project_id).\
            filter_by(user_id=user_id).\
            filter_by(vm_state=vm_state).\
            count()
```

Alternatively, the following code would validate the input before passing it into the query:

```python
    def _get_count_by_vm_state_in_db(context, project_id, user_id, vm_state):
        if not project_id or not user_id or not vm_state:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input")

        return context.session.query(models.Instance.id).\
            filter_by(deleted=0).\
            filter_by(project_id=project_id).\
            filter_by(user_id=user_id).\
            filter_by(vm_state=vm_state).\
            count()
```

No other security defects are detected in the code.
