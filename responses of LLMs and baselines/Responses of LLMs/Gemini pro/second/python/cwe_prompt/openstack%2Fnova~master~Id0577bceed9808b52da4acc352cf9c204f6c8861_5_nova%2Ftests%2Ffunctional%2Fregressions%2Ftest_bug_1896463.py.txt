## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ("Resource Exhaustion")

**Line 191-200:** This code uses `time.sleep` to introduce artificial delays in the `Instance.drop_migration_context` method. This is done to create a race condition between the evacuation process and the `_update_available_resource` periodic task. The race condition can lead to the deletion of PCI allocations made by the evacuation process, which can cause the instance to lose its PCI resources.

**Solution:** Instead of using `time.sleep`, the race condition should be addressed by modifying the code to use proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores.

## CWE-362: Equivocation or Inconsistent Presentation of Security Features or Controls

**Line 203-212:** This code uses `time.sleep` to introduce artificial delays in the `MigrationList.get_in_progress_and_error` method. This is done to create a race condition between the evacuation process and the `_update_available_resource` periodic task. The race condition can lead to the deletion of PCI allocations made by the evacuation process, which can cause the instance to lose its PCI resources.

**Solution:** Instead of using `time.sleep`, the race condition should be addressed by modifying the code to use proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores.
