**CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Bounds Checking or Reliance on Memory Layout**

**Line Number:** 45
**Description:** 
The following line of code makes an assumption about the content of the returned object from Nova that is untrusted external input. If there is more than one element in the return value, then the access to `used` and `free` would be out of bounds and would crash the server.

```python
self.useFixture(fixtures.MockPatch(
             'nova.virt.libvirt.LibvirtDriver._get_local_gb_info',
             return_value={'total': 128,
                           'used': 44,
                           'free': 84}))
```

**Solution:**
Ensure that the returned object contains the expected elements and validate the indices before accessing them.
