**CWE-20:** Improper Input Validation
The `_update_arp_entry()` function does not validate the input parameters `operation` and `subnet_id`, which can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or gain unauthorized access to the system. The `operation` parameter can be set to a value other than "add" or "delete", allowing the attacker to perform unexpected actions. Similarly, the `subnet_id` parameter can be spoofed, enabling an attacker to target a specific subnet and potentially gain access to sensitive information.
Solution: Implement proper input validation to ensure that the `operation` and `subnet_id` parameters are valid and match the expected values. This can be done through validation functions, type checks, or other appropriate mechanisms.

**CWE-117:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
The `process_floating_ip_nat_rules()` function does not properly neutralize the input received from `self.get_ex_gw_port()`. An attacker could potentially manipulate the input to execute arbitrary commands or gain unauthorized access to the system.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and neutralization to ensure that the input received from `self.get_ex_gw_port()` is safe and will not lead to security vulnerabilities. This can be done through validation functions, type checks, or other appropriate mechanisms.
