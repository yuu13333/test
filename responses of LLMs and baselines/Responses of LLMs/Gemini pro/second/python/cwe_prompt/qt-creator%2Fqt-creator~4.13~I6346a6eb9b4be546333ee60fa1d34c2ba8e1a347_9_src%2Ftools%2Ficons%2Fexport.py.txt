The following security defects were identified in the code:

**CWE-78:** OS Command Injection

**Description:** Line 102: The user input in args.filter is passed directly into a subprocess call without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system by providing a crafted value for args.filter.

**Solution:** Sanitize the user input in args.filter to prevent malicious characters from being interpreted as operating system commands. This can be done by using a library function like re.escape() or by manually escaping special characters.

**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**

**Description:** Line 55: The user input in args.filter is used to filter the SVG elements that are exported to PNG files. If the user input is not properly validated, it could lead to unexpected behavior or even a security vulnerability.

**Solution:** Validate the user input in args.filter to ensure that it is a valid regular expression and that it does not contain any malicious characters.

**CWE-362: Race Condition**

**Description:** Line 104: The subprocess call to Inkscape is made without specifying a timeout. This could lead to a race condition where the Inkscape process is not terminated properly, resulting in the script hanging or running forever.

**Solution:** Specify a timeout for the Inkscape process using the timeout parameter in subprocess.Popen().
