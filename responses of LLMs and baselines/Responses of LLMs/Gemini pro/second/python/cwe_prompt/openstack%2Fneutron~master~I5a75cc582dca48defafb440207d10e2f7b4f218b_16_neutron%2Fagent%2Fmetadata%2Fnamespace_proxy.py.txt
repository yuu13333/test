### Raising Exceptions Without Enough Information (CWE-252)
 **Description**: In computing, an exception is an unplanned event that disrupts the normal flow of program execution and must be handled. Exceptions usually occur when the code encounters an unexpected input or condition that it cannot handle.
 **Line(s) of Code**: 68
 **Solution**: Additional information should be provided when raising the exception. In this case, the error message should include the specific network ID or router ID that is causing the issue. For example:
```
raise exceptions.NetworkIdOrRouterIdRequiredError(
    "Both network_id and router_id must be specified"
)
```

### Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312)
 **Description**: This weakness occurs when sensitive information is stored in cleartext. Cleartext is any form of unencrypted data transmitted or stored without any obfuscation or encoding. Anyone who intercepts or accesses the data can read and understand it without requiring any specialized knowledge or tools to decrypt it.
 **Line(s) of Code**: 113-114
 **Solution**: The configuration file path should be generated using a more secure method, such as a properly seeded random number generator. Additionally, the file should be stored in a secure location that is not accessible to unauthorized users.
```
import os
import uuid

def get_config_path(state_path):
    return os.path.join(state_path or cfg.CONF.state_path,
                         PROXY_CONFIG_DIR)

def generate_config_file_path(uuid):
    return os.path.join(get_config_path(None),
                         f"{uuid}.conf")
```

### Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
 **Description**: This weakness occurs when input is not validated or is insufficiently validated for malicious or unexpected inputs. A malicious user could send unexpected input in order to cause the application to crash or behave in an unintended way.
 **Line(s) of Code**: 71-72, 81-84, 86-89
 **Solution**: The code should validate the user and group inputs to ensure that they are valid values. For example, the code could check that the user and group exist in the system and that they have the appropriate permissions.
```
import pwd
import grp

def __init__(self, ...):
    ...
    if user is None:
        self.user = str(os.geteuid())
    else:
        try:
            pw_user = pwd.getpwnam(user)
            self.user = pw_user[0]
        except KeyError:
            raise exceptions.InvalidUserError(user)

    if group is None:
        self.group = str(os.getegid())
    else:
        try:
            groupname = grp.getgrnam(group).gr_name
            self.group = groupname
        except KeyError:
            raise exceptions.InvalidGroupError(group)
```
