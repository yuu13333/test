**CWE-200: Information Exposure - Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Log File**
- **Description:** The `_call_agent` function logs any errors it encounters, including error messages and the arguments used in the call to the agent. This could potentially expose sensitive information to an attacker if the logs are accessible to unauthorized users.
- **Solution:** Redact or mask any sensitive information before logging it.

**CWE-201: Information Exposure - Unrestricted File Upload**
- **Description:** The `inject_file` function allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the guest VM. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the VM or to execute malicious code.
- **Solution:** Implement input validation to ensure that only authorized files are uploaded to the guest VM.

**CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**
- **Description:** The `find_guest_agent` function does not perform any authentication before checking for the presence of a guest agent. This could potentially allow an attacker to spoof the presence of a guest agent and gain unauthorized access to the VM.
- **Solution:** Implement authentication to ensure that only authorized users can check for the presence of a guest agent.

**CWE-602: Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Release**
- **Description:** The `_get_expected_build` function stores the build information for the guest agent in memory. This information could potentially be accessed by an attacker if the memory is not cleared before the function returns.
- **Solution:** Clear the memory containing the build information before the function returns.

**CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision**
- **Description:** The `should_use_agent` function relies on the `USE_AGENT_SM_KEY` system metadata key to determine whether to use the agent. If an attacker modifies this key, they could potentially control whether or not the agent is used.
- **Solution:** Implement input validation to ensure that the `USE_AGENT_SM_KEY` system metadata key is not being tampered with.
