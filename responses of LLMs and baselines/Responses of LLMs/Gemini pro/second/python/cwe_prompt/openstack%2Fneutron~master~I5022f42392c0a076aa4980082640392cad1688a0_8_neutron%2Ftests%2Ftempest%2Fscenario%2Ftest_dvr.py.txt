The following security defect is detected in the code:

**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**

Line 38: The port_status variable is defined without validation, allowing an attacker to set the 'admin_state_up' to True, which can potentially lead to a denial of service attack.

**Solution:**

Add input validation to the port_status variable to ensure that the 'admin_state_up' value is valid. For example:

```python
import netaddr
port_status = {'admin_state_up': netaddr.valid_ipv4(port_status['admin_state_up'])}
```
