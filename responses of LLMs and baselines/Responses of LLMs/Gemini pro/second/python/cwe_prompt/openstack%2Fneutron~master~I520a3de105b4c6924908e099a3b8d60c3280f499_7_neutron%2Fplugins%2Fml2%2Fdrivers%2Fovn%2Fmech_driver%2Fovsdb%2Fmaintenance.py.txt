## CWE-369: Direct Statement Evaluation

### Description:
The code does not sufficiently verify the input before executing it or using it to control the flow of the program.

### Example:
Line 510:
```
addresses = self._nb_idl.lsp_set_addresses(
    port.name, addresses=addresses).execute(check_error=True)
```

### Solution:
The code should handle exceptions that may occur when executing the `lsp_set_addresses` method, such as `OvnDbError`.

## CWE-390: Inter-Process Communication Errors

### Description:
The code may encounter errors when communicating with other processes or systems, leading to unexpected behavior or system failures.

### Example:
Line 529:
```
self._ovn_client.set_gateway_mtu(context, net)
```

### Solution:
The code should handle any potential errors that may occur during the execution of `set_gateway_mtu`, such as `OVNClientError`.
