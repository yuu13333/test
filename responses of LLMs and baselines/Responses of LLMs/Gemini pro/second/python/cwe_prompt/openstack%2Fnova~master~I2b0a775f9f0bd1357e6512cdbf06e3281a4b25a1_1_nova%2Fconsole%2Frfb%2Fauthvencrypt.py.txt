The code receives a VeNCrypt version from the server and checks if it is the expected version (0.2). If it is not, it raises an exception. However, the code does not handle the case where the server does not send a VeNCrypt version, which could lead to a buffer over-read and a potential denial of service attack.

**CWE:** CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Line Number:** 80
**Solution:** Add a check to ensure that the server sends a VeNCrypt version before attempting to read it.
```
if len(recv) < 2:
    reason = _("Server did not send VeNCrypt version")
    raise exception.RFBAuthHandshakeFailed(reason=reason)
```
