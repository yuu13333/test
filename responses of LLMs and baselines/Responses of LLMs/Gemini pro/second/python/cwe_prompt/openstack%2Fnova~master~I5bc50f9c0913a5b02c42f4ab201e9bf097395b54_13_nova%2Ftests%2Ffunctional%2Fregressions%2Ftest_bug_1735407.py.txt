**CWE-366: Weak Cryptographic Algorithm**

This code uses `time.sleep` to delay the processing of one of the rebuild requests. This is a poor way to handle concurrency as it can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks. A better approach would be to use a more reliable and secure method of handling concurrency, such as a lock or semaphore.

**Line 86:**

```python
time.sleep(0.5)
```

**Solution:**

```python
import threading
lock = threading.Lock()
lock.acquire()
# ...
lock.release()
```
