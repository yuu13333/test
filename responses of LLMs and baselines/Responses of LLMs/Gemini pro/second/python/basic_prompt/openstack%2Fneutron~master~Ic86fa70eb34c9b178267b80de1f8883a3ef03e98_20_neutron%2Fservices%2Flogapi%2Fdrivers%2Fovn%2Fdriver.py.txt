**Line 251:**

The `network_logging_supported` function is not defined anywhere in the code. This function is referenced in the `create_log_precommit` method, but it is not declared or implemented. This raises an exception at runtime and should be fixed.

To fix this issue, the `network_logging_supported` function should be defined. It checks if the OVN NB database has a column named "fair" in the "Meter" table, indicating whether network logging is supported. If it is not defined, the `create_log_precommit` method should raise the appropriate exception to indicate that network logging is not supported.
