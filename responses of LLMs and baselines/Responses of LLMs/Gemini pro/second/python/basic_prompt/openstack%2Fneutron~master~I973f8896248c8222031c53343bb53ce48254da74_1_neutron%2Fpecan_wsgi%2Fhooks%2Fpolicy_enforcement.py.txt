205             state.response.status_code = 404
206             return

The explanation is the code handles the case where the PolicyNotAuthorized is raised during authorization check in the 'after' hook. But when InvalidScope is raised during the policy check, no further action is taken except for logging the error, but the actual response to the user is empty. In this case, the exception must also be explicitly caught, to prevent its propagation to the exception translation hook. In the event of a failed policy check for the 'list' action, the status code should be set to 403.
