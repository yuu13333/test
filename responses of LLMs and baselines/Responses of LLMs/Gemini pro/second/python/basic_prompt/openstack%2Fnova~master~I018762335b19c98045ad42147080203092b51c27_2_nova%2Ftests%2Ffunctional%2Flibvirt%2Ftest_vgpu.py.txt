**Security Defect**: Hard-coded API password in code

The code contains a hard-coded API password in the `_revert_resize` method, which is a security risk. Hard-coding passwords in code is not recommended as it can be easily compromised and allow unauthorized access to the system.

**Solution**: Replace the hard-coded API password with a secure mechanism for storing and retrieving passwords, such as a password manager or a secure key storage solution.

```python
# Hard-coded API password
revert_resize_req = {'revertResize': None}

# Solution: Use a secure password management mechanism instead
revert_resize_req = {'revertResize': {'password': os.environ['API_PASSWORD']}}
```

**No security defects are detected in the rest of the code.**
