Line 495: The function `_strip_ignore_hosts` is trying to strip the hosts to be ignored from the host map, but it also removes any hosts that are already ignored. This can lead to inconsistent behavior and should be fixed.

The correct code should be:

```python
    def _strip_ignore_hosts(self, host_map, hosts_to_ignore):
        ignored_hosts = []
        for host in hosts_to_ignore:
            for (hostname, nodename) in list(host_map.keys()):
                if host.lower() != hostname.lower():
                    continue
                del host_map[(hostname, nodename)]
                ignored_hosts.append(host)
        ignored_hosts_str = ', '.join(ignored_hosts)
        LOG.info(_LI('Host filter ignoring hosts: %s'), ignored_hosts_str)
```
