The following security defects were found in the code:

**Line 180**: The query for `self._get_security_group` is not correctly scoped to the current project. An attacker could exploit this to access security groups from other projects.
**Solution**: Add `project_id=context.project_id` to the query to ensure that it is only returning security groups from the current project.

**Line 330**: The `_validate_security_group_rules` function does not check for duplicate rules within the same security group. An attacker could exploit this to create multiple rules with the same parameters, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
**Solution**: Add a check within `_validate_security_group_rules` to ensure that there are no duplicate rules within the same security group.

**Line 518**: The `_validate_security_group_rule` function does not check for duplicate rules within the same security group. An attacker could exploit this to create multiple rules with the same parameters, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
**Solution**: Add a check within `_validate_security_group_rule` to ensure that there are no duplicate rules within the same security group.

**Line 533**: The `_validate_security_group_rule` function does not check that the `security_group_id` field in the rule matches the `security_group_id` field in the security group object. An attacker could exploit this to create rules for security groups that they do not have access to.
**Solution**: Add a check within `_validate_security_group_rule` to ensure that the `security_group_id` field in the rule matches the `security_group_id` field in the security group object.

**Line 623**: The `_check_for_duplicate_rules` function relies on the `_rule_to_key` function to generate a unique key for each rule. However, the `_rule_to_key` function does not take into account the `security_group_id` field, which means that it is possible for two rules in different security groups to have the same key. An attacker could exploit this to create duplicate rules across multiple security groups.
**Solution**: Modify the `_rule_to_key` function to include the `security_group_id` field in the key.
