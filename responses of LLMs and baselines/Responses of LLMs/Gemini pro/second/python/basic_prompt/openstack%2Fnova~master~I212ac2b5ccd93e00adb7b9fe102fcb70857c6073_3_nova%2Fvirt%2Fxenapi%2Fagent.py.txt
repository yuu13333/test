There is a security vulnerability present within the code. The function `decrypt` of the `SimpleDH` class does not verify the padding of the input before decrypting it, which could lead to a padding oracle attack.

This version of the code is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks:
```
    def decrypt(self, text):
        return self._run_ssl(text, decrypt=True)
```
This is because `_run_ssl` does not verify the padding of the input before decrypting it. An attacker could use this to recover the plaintext of encrypted messages by sending specially crafted padding to the server and observing the server's response.

This is a serious vulnerability, as it could allow an attacker to decrypt sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.

The following code is a fixed version of the `decrypt` function that verifies the padding of the input before decrypting it:
```
    def decrypt(self, text):
        plaintext = self._run_ssl(text, decrypt=True)
        if not plaintext.endswith(b'\0'):
            raise ValueError("Invalid padding")
        return plaintext[:-1]
```
