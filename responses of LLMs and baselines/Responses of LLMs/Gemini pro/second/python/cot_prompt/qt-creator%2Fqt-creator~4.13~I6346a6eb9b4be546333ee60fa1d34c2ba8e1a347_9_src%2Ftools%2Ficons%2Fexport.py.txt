**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe code uses subprocess.Popen() and subprocess.run() to call external programs (Inkscape and Optipng) without sanitizing the input. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system if they can control the input to the script.\n\nTo fix this, the code should use the `check_output` or `check_call` methods of the `subprocess` module instead. These methods will raise an exception if the external program returns a non-zero exit code, which will help to prevent arbitrary code execution.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `check_output` method to call Inkscape:\n\n```python\ninkscape_output = subprocess.check_output([inkscape, \'--shell\'],\n                                         stdin=subprocess.PIPE,\n                                         cwd=qtcRoot())\n```\n\nAnd here is an example of how to use the `check_call` method to call Optipng:\n\n```python\nsubprocess.check_call([optipng,\n                             "-o7",\n                             "-strip", "all",\n                             png],\n                            cwd=qtcRoot())\n```
