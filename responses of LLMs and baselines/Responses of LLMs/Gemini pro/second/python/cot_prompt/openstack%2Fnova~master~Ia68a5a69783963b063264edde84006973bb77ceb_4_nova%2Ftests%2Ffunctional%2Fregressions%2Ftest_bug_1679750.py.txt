**No security defects are detected in the provided code.**\n\nThe code appears to be focused on testing the cleanup of allocations for an instance that was local deleted while the compute host was down. It sets up the necessary fixtures, creates and deletes a server, and verifies that the resource provider usages are cleaned up properly.\n\nThe code uses appropriate fixtures and mocks to isolate the test and prevent interactions with external systems. It also follows best practices for unit testing, such as using assertions to verify expected behavior.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be secure and well-written for its intended purpose.
