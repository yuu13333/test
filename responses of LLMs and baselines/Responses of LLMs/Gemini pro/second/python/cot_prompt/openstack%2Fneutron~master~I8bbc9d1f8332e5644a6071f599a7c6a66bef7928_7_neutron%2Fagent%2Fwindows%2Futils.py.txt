**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe code uses the `subprocess` module to execute commands, and it takes precautions to avoid blocking other greenthreads by using `tpool.execute` when called from a greenthread. It also uses `eventlet.patcher.original` to ensure that native threads are used, as pipes are blocking on Windows.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security defects.
