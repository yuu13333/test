**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**

* Line 214: The code asserts the existence of a namespace without proper locking or synchronization. This could lead to race conditions and incorrect results.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

* Line 206: The code creates a network without following proper coding standards for variable naming (e.g., `network` should be `network_id`).
