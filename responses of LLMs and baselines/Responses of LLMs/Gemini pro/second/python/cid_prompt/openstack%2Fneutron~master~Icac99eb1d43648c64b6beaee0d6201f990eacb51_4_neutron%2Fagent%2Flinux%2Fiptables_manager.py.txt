The following security defects are detected in the code:

**1. CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure:**
- In the `_modify_rules` method, removing duplicate rules and chains is not handled properly. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues as duplicate rules may override or conflict with each other, or unnecessary chains may remain in the configuration.

**2. CWE-707 Improper Neutralization:**
- In the `_modify_rules` method, removing rules and chains from the filter using `_weed_out_removes` can fail to remove them effectively, leaving them in the configuration. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues as rules and chains that should have been removed may continue to be enforced.

**3. CWE-710 Improper Adherence to Coding Standards:**
- The code contains several instances of duplicate code and can benefit from refactoring to improve clarity and maintainability. For example, the `_find_rules_index` and `_find_table` methods can be merged into a single method to simplify the logic.

**4. CWE-682 Incorrect Calculation:**
- In the `_get_traffic_counters` method, zeroing traffic counters using the `-Z` option may not work as expected if the iptables version does not support it.

Here are the recommended solutions for the detected defects:

**1. CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure:**
- Enhance the logic in the `_modify_rules` method to effectively remove duplicate rules and chains, ensuring that the resulting configuration does not contain unnecessary or conflicting elements.

**2. CWE-707 Improper Neutralization:**
- Improve the `_modify_rules` method to ensure that rules and chains that should be removed are effectively removed from the filter. This can be achieved by using a more robust mechanism for identifying and removing these elements.

**3. CWE-710 Improper Adherence to Coding Standards:**
- Refactor the code to eliminate duplicate code and improve clarity. Consider merging the `_find_rules_index` and `_find_table` methods into a single method to simplify the logic.

**4. CWE-682 Incorrect Calculation:**
- In the `_get_traffic_counters` method, add a check to verify that the iptables version supports the `-Z` option before using it to zero traffic counters. This ensures that the method works as intended on different iptables versions.
