**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):**
- **Line 83:** In the `floating_forward_rules` function, the script checks if the `self.fip_ns` attribute is set before attempting to access the `get_rtr_ext_device_name` attribute. This check ensures that the namespace has been initialized before accessing its attributes.
- **Line 129:** In the `add_floating_ip_rule` function, the script checks if the `self.fip_ns` attribute is set before attempting to access the `allocate_rule_priority` attribute. This check ensures that the namespace has been initialized before accessing its attributes.
- **Line 152:** In the `_remove_floating_ip_rule` function, the script checks if the `floating_ip` key exists in the `self.floating_ips_dict` dictionary before attempting to delete the rule. This check ensures that the floating IP has been added before attempting to remove its rule.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):**
- **Line 107:** In the `floating_ip_added_dist` function, the script checks if the floating IP is bound to the host before attempting to add the floating IP rule. This check ensures that the floating IP is intended for this host before adding the rule.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):**
- **Line 106:** In the `floating_ip_added_dist` function, the script checks if the floating IP is bound to the host before attempting to add the floating IP rule. This check ensures that the floating IP is intended for this host before allocating resources for the rule.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**
- None detected.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):**
- **Line 105:** In the `remove_centralized_floatingip` function, the script checks if the floating IP exists in the `self.centralized_floatingips_set` set before attempting to remove it. This check ensures that the floating IP has been added before attempting to remove it.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):**
- None detected.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):**
- None detected.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):**
- **Line 260:** In the `_update_arp_entry` function, the script checks if the network device exists before attempting to add or delete the ARP entry. This check ensures that the device is present before attempting to modify its ARP entries.
- **Line 319:** In the `_delete_gateway_device_if_exists` function, the script checks if the gateway device exists before attempting to delete its route. This check ensures that the device is present before attempting to modify its routes.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):**
- **Line 267:** In the `_cache_arp_entry` function, the script caches the ARP entry if the device does not exist yet. This ensures that the ARP entry is not lost if the device is created later.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):**
- None detected.
