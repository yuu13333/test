The following security defects are detected in the code:

**1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

CWE-284 error is detected on line 150. 

  * **Description**: The code does not properly control access to the device path. The `_get_device_path` method takes the `connection_info` parameter, which may contain sensitive information such as credentials or API keys. However, the method does not validate the user's permissions before returning the device path. This could allow an unauthorized user to access the device path and potentially compromise the system.

  * **Solution**: The code should validate the user's permissions before returning the device path. This can be done by checking the user's role or group membership, or by using a role-based access control (RBAC) system.

**2. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**

CWE-693 error is detected on line 176. 

  * **Description**: The code does not properly handle the case where the mount is not unmounted correctly. The code tries to unmount the volume if it is not mounted, but it does not handle the case where the unmount fails. This could allow an attacker to mount the volume on a different system and access the data on the volume.

  * **Solution**: The code should properly handle the case where the unmount fails. This can be done by logging the error and retrying the unmount operation, or by using a more robust unmount method.
