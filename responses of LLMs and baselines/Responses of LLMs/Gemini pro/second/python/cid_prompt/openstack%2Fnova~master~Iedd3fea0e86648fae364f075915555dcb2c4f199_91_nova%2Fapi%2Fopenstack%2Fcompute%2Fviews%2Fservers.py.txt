1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**:
    - Line 125: The `context` variable is retrieved from the request environment without any authorization checks. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive information if they can manipulate the request environment.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**:
    - Line 316: The `get_by_instance_uuid` method is called on the `objects.InstanceMapping` class without specifying the context. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the context is not properly set.

3. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**:
    - Line 250: The `sha_hash` variable is initialized with the concatenation of the `project` and `host` variables, but the `project` variable is a string and the `host` variable is a `NoneType` object. This will result in a TypeError when the `sha_hash` variable is used.

4. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**:
    - Line 181: The code inside the `try` block attempts to access the `ids` attribute of the `instance.trusted_certs` object, but it doesn't handle the case where the `instance.trusted_certs` object is `None`. This could lead to an AttributeError being raised.

5. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**:
    - Line 322: The `pass` statement is used to handle the `InstanceMappingNotFound` exception, but it doesn't provide any logging or error handling. This could make it difficult to debug issues related to instance mapping.

6. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**:
    - Line 219: The `return` statement in the `_list_view` method is missing a colon at the end of the line, which is a violation of the PEP 8 coding standard.
