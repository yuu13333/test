7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: In line 443, the `_gateway_ports_equal` method compares two gateway ports by filtering out certain keys from their dictionaries. If the filtered dictionaries are equal, the method returns True. However, this comparison is incorrect because it does not consider the values of the filtered keys. For example, if two gateway ports have different host IDs, the filtered dictionaries will be equal, but the ports are not actually equal.
