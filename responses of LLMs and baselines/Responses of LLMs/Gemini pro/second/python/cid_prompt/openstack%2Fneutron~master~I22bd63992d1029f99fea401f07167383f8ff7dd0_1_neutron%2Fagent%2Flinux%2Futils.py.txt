There is one security defect detected in the provided code:

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**

* Line 333: `return f.readline().split('\0')[:-1]`

The function `get_cmdline_from_pid` reads the `cmdline` file of a process to obtain the command line arguments of that process. The function splits the contents of the file using the `'\0'` character as a delimiter. However, there is no guarantee that the `'\0'` character is not present in the command line arguments themselves. This could lead to the incorrect calculation of the command line arguments and, consequently, to security issues.

The correct way to handle this situation is to use a different delimiter, such as a space character, to split the contents of the file. This will ensure that the command line arguments are correctly parsed even if they contain the `'\0'` character.

**Proposed Solution:**

```python
def get_cmdline_from_pid(pid):
    if not process_is_running(pid):
        return []
    with open('/proc/%s/cmdline' % pid, 'r') as f:
        return f.readline().split(' ')
```
