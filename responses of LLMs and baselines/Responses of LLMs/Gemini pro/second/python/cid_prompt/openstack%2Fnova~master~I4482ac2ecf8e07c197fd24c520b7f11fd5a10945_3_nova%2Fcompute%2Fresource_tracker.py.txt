**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** No security defects are detected in the code. The code is specifically designed to manage resource usage and access to nodes based on resource claims and authorization checks.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):** No security defects are detected in the code. The code follows a logical flow of resource allocation and deallocation, ensuring proper coordination between different entities involved in managing compute resources.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):** No security defects are detected in the code. Resource allocation and deallocation are handled in a controlled manner, preventing resource exhaustion or improper release.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):** No security defects are detected in the code. The code performs calculations for resource usage and availability based on well-defined formulas and logic, minimizing the risk of incorrect calculations.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):** No security defects are detected in the code. The code follows a clear and logical control flow, with appropriate checks and conditions to handle various scenarios and prevent unintended execution paths.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):** No security defects are detected in the code. Resource management and access are protected through mechanisms such as resource claims, authorization checks, and isolation of resources, mitigating the risk of protection mechanism failures.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):** No security defects are detected in the code. Comparisons are performed using appropriate operators and data types, minimizing the risk of incorrect comparisons.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** No security defects are detected in the code. Exceptional conditions are handled appropriately, preventing unexpected behavior or system crashes.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):** No security defects are detected in the code. Data received from external sources or user input is not directly used in resource allocation or access decisions, mitigating the risk of improper neutralization.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):** No security defects are detected in the code. The code appears to adhere to accepted coding standards and best practices, minimizing the likelihood of security vulnerabilities.
