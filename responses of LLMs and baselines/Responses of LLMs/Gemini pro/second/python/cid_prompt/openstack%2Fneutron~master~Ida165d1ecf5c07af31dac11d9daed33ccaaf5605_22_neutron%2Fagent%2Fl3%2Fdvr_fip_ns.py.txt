1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - Line 117: The code does not properly handle exceptions when configuring the gateway port. This can lead to an attacker gaining access to the network if the exception is not handled properly.
2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
   - Line 279: The code attempts to update the gateway route without first checking if the 'fg-' device exists in the namespace. This can lead to an exception being thrown and the gateway not being properly configured.
3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - Line 157: The code does not properly handle the case where the agent gateway port has been deleted. This can lead to the namespace being left in an inconsistent state.
4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
   - Line 263: The code does not properly handle the case where the gateway IP is not a valid IP address. This can lead to an exception being thrown and the gateway not being properly configured.
5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
   - Line 112: The code does not properly handle the case where an exception is thrown while configuring the gateway port. This can lead to the namespace being left in an inconsistent state.
6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
   - Line 155: The code does not properly configure the 'net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind' sysctl. This can lead to IP spoofing attacks.
7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
   - Line 245: The code does not properly check if the gateway IP has changed. This can lead to the gateway not being properly updated.
8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
   - Line 155: The code does not properly handle the case where the 'net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind' sysctl cannot be set. This can lead to IP spoofing attacks.
9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
   - Line 155: The code does not properly neutralize the 'net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind' sysctl. This can lead to IP spoofing attacks.
10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
    - Line 111: The code does not properly handle exceptions. This can lead to errors and the script not completing successfully.
