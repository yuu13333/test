1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
   - **Defect**: The code does not verify the identity of the client making the request, allowing unauthorized access to the Keepalived state change server.
   - **Line number**: 71
   - **Solution**: Add authentication and authorization mechanisms to the server to ensure that only authorized clients can access it.

2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)
   - **Defect**: The code does not properly handle concurrent requests to the Keepalived state change server, which could lead to race conditions and data corruption.
   - **Line number**: 73
   - **Solution**: Implement proper locking or synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one request is processed at a time.

3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
   - **Defect**: The code does not properly close the Unix domain socket when the server is stopped, which could lead to resource leaks.
   - **Line number**: 75
   - **Solution**: Add a cleanup function to the server to properly close the socket when it is no longer needed.

4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
   - **Defect**: The code does not calculate the batch duration accurately, which could lead to events not being processed in a timely manner.
   - **Line number**: 115
   - **Solution**: Correct the calculation to ensure that the batch duration is sufficient for all events to be processed in a timely manner.

5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)
   - **Defect**: The code does not handle errors when fetching router information, which could lead to the server failing to process events.
   - **Line number**: 123
   - **Solution**: Add error handling to the code to ensure that the server can continue to process events even if there are errors fetching router information.

6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)
   - **Defect**: The code does not properly escape special characters in the router ID, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the server.
   - **Line number**: 45
   - **Solution**: Escape special characters in the router ID to prevent malicious code injection.

7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)
   - **Defect**: The code does not properly compare the current state with the previous state, which could lead to the server sending incorrect state updates to the plugin.
   - **Line number**: 96
   - **Solution**: Correct the comparison to ensure that the server only sends state updates when the state has actually changed.

8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
   - **Defect**: The code does not properly handle exceptions when updating the router's state, which could lead to the server failing to process events.
   - **Line number**: 135
   - **Solution**: Add error handling to the code to ensure that the server can continue to process events even if there are errors updating the router's state.

9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
   - **Defect**: The code does not properly neutralize user-supplied data in the router ID, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the server.
   - **Line number**: 45
   - **Solution**: Neutralize user-supplied data in the router ID to prevent malicious code injection.

10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)
   - **Defect**: The code does not follow consistent coding conventions, which could make it difficult to read and maintain.
   - **Line number**: Throughout the code
   - **Solution**: Adhere to consistent coding conventions to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
