1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - **Line 118**: The method `get_port_forwarding_obj_by_routers` does not perform any access control checks before querying the database for port forwarding objects. This could allow an unauthorized user to access sensitive information about port forwarding objects.
   - **Solution**: Add access control checks to the `get_port_forwarding_obj_by_routers` method to ensure that only authorized users can access port forwarding objects.


2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
   - **Line 119**: The method `get_port_forwarding_obj_by_routers` joins the `cls.db_model` and `l3.FloatingIP` tables without specifying any conditions for the join. This could result in the query returning incorrect results if the tables are not properly related.
   - **Solution**: Specify the conditions for the join between the `cls.db_model` and `l3.FloatingIP` tables to ensure that the query returns the correct results.


3. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
   - **Line 129**: The method `_unique_port_forwarding_iterator` uses the `itertools.groupby` function to group the results of the query by the router ID. However, the function does not handle the case where the query returns an empty result set. This could result in an error being raised when the function attempts to iterate over the empty result set.
   - **Solution**: Add error handling to the `_unique_port_forwarding_iterator` method to handle the case where the query returns an empty result set.
