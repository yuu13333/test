**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

* **Line 245:** Policy enforcement is performed by third-party library and the `PolicyNotAuthorized` exception is only handled within the section (catching a subset of violations).
Solution: Use the `Policy` class to enforce access control and handle all possible exceptions, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**

* **Line 260:** The code calls `policy.check` passing a custom string as an action. This action is not defined anywhere and its corresponding rule is not applied to the resource.
Solution: Define the custom action in the policy file and ensure that it is applied to the resource.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

* **Line 169:** If `resource` is equal to 'extension', the policy check is skipped. However, the code still processes the response and filters attributes based on the policy.
Solution: Ensure that the policy check is performed even for extensions.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**

* **Line 262:** When checking the policy for a specific attribute, the code uses a custom string as an action. This action is not defined anywhere and its corresponding rule is not applied to the resource.
Solution: Define the custom action in the policy file and ensure that it is applied to the resource.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**

* **Line 146:** The code catches the `PolicyNotAuthorized` exception and conditionally reraises it. However, if the condition is not met, the exception is not reraised and the code continues execution.
Solution: Always reraise the `PolicyNotAuthorized` exception if it is caught.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**

* **Line 256:** The code compares `attr_name` to 'project_id', but the attribute name is actually 'tenant_id'.
Solution: Correct the comparison to 'tenant_id'.
