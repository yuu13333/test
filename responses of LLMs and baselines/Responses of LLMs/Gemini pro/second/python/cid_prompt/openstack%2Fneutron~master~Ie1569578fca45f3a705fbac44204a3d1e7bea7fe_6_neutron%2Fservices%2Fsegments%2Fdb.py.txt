The following security defects are detected in the code:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): In the `update_segment_host_mapping` function, the `context` object is not properly validated or authenticated before executing database operations. This could allow an attacker with access to the database to modify or delete segment host mappings without proper authorization. (Line 184)

2. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): In the `get_segments_with_phys_nets` function, the `context` object is not properly validated or authenticated before executing database operations. This could allow an attacker with access to the database to retrieve sensitive segment information without proper authorization. (Line 235)

3. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): In the `map_segment_to_hosts` function, the `context` object is not properly validated or authenticated before executing database operations. This could allow an attacker with access to the database to create or modify segment host mappings without proper authorization. (Line 241)

4. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): In the `_update_segment_host_mapping_for_agent` function, the `context` object is not properly validated or authenticated before executing database operations. This could allow an attacker with access to the database to modify or delete segment host mappings without proper authorization. (Line 247)

5. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): In the `_add_segment_host_mapping_for_segment` function, the `context` object is not properly validated or authenticated before executing database operations. This could allow an attacker with access to the database to create or modify segment host mappings without proper authorization. (Line 272)

6. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): In the `_delete_segments_for_network` function, the `context` object is not properly validated or authenticated before executing database operations. This could allow an attacker with access to the database to delete segments without proper authorization. (Line 290)
