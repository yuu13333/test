The following security defects are detected in the code:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
   - Line 50: The `create` method of `metering_objs.MeteringLabel` is called without checking if the user has the required permissions to create a metering label. This could allow an unauthorized user to create metering labels and potentially gain access to sensitive information.
   - Line 132: The `create` method of `metering_objs.MeteringLabelRule` is called without checking if the user has the required permissions to create a metering label rule. This could allow an unauthorized user to create metering label rules and potentially gain access to sensitive information.

2. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
   - Line 125: The `&` operator is used to compare two `netaddr.IPSet` objects. This is not a safe way to compare IP addresses, as it could lead to false positives or false negatives. A more robust approach would be to use the `issubset` method of `netaddr.IPSet` to check if one IP set is a subset of another.

3. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
   - Line 50: The `with` statement is not indented properly. This makes the code difficult to read and understand.
   - Line 132: The `with` statement is not indented properly. This makes the code difficult to read and understand.

Recommendations:

1.CWE-284
   - Line 50: Add an authorization check to ensure that the user has the required permissions to create a metering label.
   - Line 132: Add an authorization check to ensure that the user has the required permissions to create a metering label rule.

2.CWE-707
   -Line 125: Replace the `&` operator with the `issubset` method of `netaddr.IPSet` to check if one IP set is a subset of another.

3.CWE-710
   -Line 50: Indent the `with` statement properly.
   -Line 132: Indent the `with` statement properly.
