**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**

Line 55: `v = ord(x)`

The code incorrectly calculates the Unicode code point of the character `x` using the `ord()` function, which returns the Unicode code point as an integer in the range 0 to 65535. However, the Unicode code points for characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) are represented as pairs of 16-bit values known as surrogate pairs. The code does not handle surrogate pairs correctly, which could result in incorrect calculations for characters beyond the BMP.

**Solution:**

To correctly calculate the Unicode code point for characters beyond the BMP, the code should use the `unicodedata.lookup()` function, which takes a Unicode character and returns its corresponding Unicode code point as an integer.

```python
v = unicodedata.lookup(x)
```

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

Line 91: `tempFile.close()`

The code does not check the return value of `tempFile.close()`, which could result in errors being silently ignored.

**Solution:**

The code should check the return value of `tempFile.close()` to ensure that the file was closed successfully.

```python
if tempFile.close() is not None:
    raise Error("Error closing temporary file")
```
