1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

   - **Line number:** 80-82, 117-119

   L3 Plugin API restricts access to the following actions based on which router operation is performed:
   - `DELETE_ROUTER`: `DELETE_RELATED_ROUTER`
   - `ADD_UPDATE_ROUTER`: `ADD_UPDATE_RELATED_ROUTER`

   However, the action map is defined with `DELETE_RELATED_ROUTER` as the RELATED_ACTION_MAP value for both `DELETE_ROUTER` and `ADD_UPDATE_ROUTER`. This means that all router operation will have the same additional RELATED_ACTION_MAP action ``DELETE_RELATED_ROUTER`. 

   **Fix:** Replace value in RELATED_ACTION_MAP with `ADD_UPDATE_RELATED_ROUTER` and `DELETE_RELATED_ROUTER` for `ADD_UPDATE_ROUTER` and `DELETE_ROUTER` respectively.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**

   - **Line number:** 284-303

   `get_host_ha_router_count` is called in the loop to retry connection to server until it is successful. However, this does not handle the case where the server is not online and may never be, introducing infinite retry.

   **Fix:** Add a timeout or limit to the number of retries.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

   - **Line number:** 535-554

   The deletion of a router is missing a check to see if it is in the `router_info` dictionary. If the router is not in the dictionary, it will be deleted and the `router_info` dictionary will not be updated. This could cause the router to be recreated if it is added back to the system.

   **Fix:** Add a check to see if the router is in the `router_info` dictionary before deleting it.

4. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**

   - **Line number:** 536-538

   The `router_info` dictionary is not updated before the router is deleted. This means that if the deletion fails, the router will still be in the `router_info` dictionary. This could cause the router to be recreated if it is added back to the system.

   **Fix:** Update the `router_info` dictionary before deleting the router.

5. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**

   - **Line number:** 400-402, 429-434

   The code does not handle the case where the `get_external_network_id` method raises an exception. This could cause the agent to fail to start.

   **Fix:** Add error handling for the `get_external_network_id` method.

6. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

   - **Line number:** 301-302

   The code does not use the standard Python logging format.

   **Fix:** Use the standard Python logging format.
