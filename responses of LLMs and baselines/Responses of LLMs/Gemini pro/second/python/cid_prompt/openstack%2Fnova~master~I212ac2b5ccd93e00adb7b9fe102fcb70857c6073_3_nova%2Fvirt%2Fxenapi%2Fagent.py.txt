**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
Line 336: `_skip_ssh_key_inject(self)` is used to compare the result of `_get_sys_meta_key(SKIP_SSH_SM_KEY)`. However, `_get_sys_meta_key` returns a string, not a boolean value. This could lead to incorrect results if the value of `SKIP_SSH_SM_KEY` is not a valid boolean string. 

**Solution:**
```python
        value = self._get_sys_meta_key(SKIP_SSH_SM_KEY)
        return strutils.bool_from_string(value, strict=False)
```

Additionally, this code is vulnerable to **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)** because the `strutils.bool_from_string` function may not interpret the value of `SKIP_SSH_SM_KEY` as expected. To fix this, you should use a more explicit comparison, such as:
```python
        return value.lower() == 'true'
```

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
Line 280: `self._call_agent(host_agent.password, args)` is missing a comma at the end of the line. This violates the PEP8 coding standard.

**Solution:**
```python
        self._call_agent(host_agent.password, args),
```

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
Line 360: The `/etc` directory is not properly secured. This could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information or modify the system configuration.

**Solution:**
The code should use a more secure method to manipulate files in `/etc`, such as using `sudo` with appropriate permissions.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
Line 390: The code does not handle the case where `use_agent_raw` is not a valid boolean string. This could lead to incorrect results or errors.

**Solution:**
The code should handle the case where `use_agent_raw` is not a valid boolean string by logging an error and returning a default value.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
Line 287: The code does not check if `self.instance['os_type']` is equal to 'windows' before executing the following code. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior if `self.instance['os_type']` is not 'windows'.

**Solution:**
The code should add a check to ensure that `self.instance['os_type']` is equal to 'windows' before executing the following code.
