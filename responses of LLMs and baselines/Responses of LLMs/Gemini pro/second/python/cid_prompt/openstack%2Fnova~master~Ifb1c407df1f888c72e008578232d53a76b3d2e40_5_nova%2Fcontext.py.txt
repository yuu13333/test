The following security defects are found in the code:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
In line 110, `project_id` can be set without any authorization checks. 
 An attacker could exploit this to gain unauthorized access to project data by setting the `project_id` attribute to a value that they should not have access to.

2. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
In line 117, `instance_lock_checked` can be set without any authorization checks.
An attacker could exploit this to gain unauthorized access to instance data by setting the `instance_lock_checked` attribute to a value that they should not have access to.

3. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
In line 164, the `_set_read_deleted` method does not check if the `read_deleted` value is valid before setting it. An attacker could exploit this to set the `read_deleted` value to an invalid value, which could lead to unintended data exposure or modification.

4. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
In line 182, the `_get_read_deleted` method does not check if the `_read_deleted` attribute is set before returning it. 
An attacker could exploit this to retrieve the `_read_deleted` attribute even if it has not been set, which could lead to unintended data exposure.

5. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
In line 191, the `_del_read_deleted` method does not check if the `_read_deleted` attribute is set before deleting it. 
An attacker could exploit this to delete the `_read_deleted` attribute even if it has not been set, which could lead to unintended data exposure or modification.

6. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
In line 223, the `elevated` method does not copy the `roles` attribute deeply. 
An attacker could exploit this to modify the `roles` attribute of the elevated context, which could lead to unintended authorization bypass.

7. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
In line 256, the `can` method does not check if the `target` is valid before using it. An attacker could exploit this to pass an invalid `target` value to the `can` method, which could lead to unintended authorization bypass.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
In line 260, the `can` method does not handle the `exception.Forbidden` exception properly. An attacker could exploit this to cause the `can` method to fail, which could lead to unintended denial of service.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
In line 402, the `target_cell` context manager does not neutralize the cell_mapping argument properly. 
An attacker could exploit this to pass a malicious cell_mapping value to the `target_cell` context manager, which could lead to unintended data exposure or modification.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
The code does not adhere to PEP8 coding standards. 
An attacker could exploit this to make the code more difficult to read and understand, which could lead to unintended errors or security vulnerabilities.
