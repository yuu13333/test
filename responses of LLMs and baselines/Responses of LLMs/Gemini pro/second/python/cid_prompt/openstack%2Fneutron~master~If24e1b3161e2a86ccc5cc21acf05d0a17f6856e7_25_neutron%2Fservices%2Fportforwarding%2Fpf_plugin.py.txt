The following security defects are detected in the code:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - **Line 261:** The `_get_fip_obj` function doesn't perform any access control checks before retrieving the floating IP object. An attacker could exploit this to access floating IP objects that they should not have access to.
   - **Line 277:** The `get_floatingip_port_forwardings` function doesn't perform any access control checks before retrieving the list of floating IP port forwarding objects. An attacker could exploit this to access floating IP port forwarding objects that they should not have access to.

2. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
   - **Line 319:** The `fip_pfs` dictionary is initialized as a `defaultdict` with a default value of `set()`. This means that for each floating IP ID, a new set is created. However, the code then adds the port forwarding ID to the set, which means that the set will always contain only one element. This could lead to incorrect results when iterating over the `fip_pfs` dictionary.

3. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
   - **Line 271:** The `_validate_filter_for_port_forwarding` function doesn't handle the case where the `request_filter` is None. This could lead to an error being thrown.

4. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
   - **Line 176:** The code checks if `pf_data` and `pf_data.get('internal_port_id')` are both not None. This is incorrect, as `pf_data` could be None but `pf_data.get('internal_port_id')` could be not None.

5. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
   - **Line 255:** The `_get_fip_obj` function doesn't handle the case where the floating IP object is not found. This could lead to an error being thrown.
   - **Line 291:** The `delete_floatingip_port_forwarding` function doesn't handle the case where the floating IP port forwarding object is not found. This could lead to an error being thrown.

6. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
   - **Line 103:** The code doesn't properly neutralize the `request_ip` before using it in the `netaddr.IPNetwork` function. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the function.

7. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
   - **Line 47:** The `make_result_with_fields` function uses the `@functools.wraps` decorator to preserve the name and docstring of the wrapped function. However, this is not necessary, as the function is already defined in the same module and has the same name and docstring.
