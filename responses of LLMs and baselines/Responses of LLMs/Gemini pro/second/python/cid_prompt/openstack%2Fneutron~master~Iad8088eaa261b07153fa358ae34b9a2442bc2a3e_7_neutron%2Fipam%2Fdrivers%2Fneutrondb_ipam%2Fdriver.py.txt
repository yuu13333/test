### CWE-682 Incorrect Calculation: 23 and 319

The code uses integer comparison to check for IP address availability which can lead to incorrect results for IPv6 addresses. To fix this issue, the code should use netaddr's IPAddress class for IP address comparison.

### Solution:

```python
from netaddr import IPAddress

def _verify_ip(self, context, ip_address):
    """Verify whether IP address can be allocated on subnet.

    :param context: neutron api request context
    :param ip_address: String representing the IP address to verify
    :raises: InvalidInput, IpAddressAlreadyAllocated
    """
    # Ensure that the IP's are unique
    if not self.subnet_manager.check_unique_allocation(context,
                                                        IPAddress(ip_address)):
        raise ipam_exc.IpAddressAlreadyAllocated(
            subnet_id=self.subnet_manager.neutron_id,
            ip=ip_address)

    # Ensure that the IP is valid on the subnet
    if not ipam_utils.check_subnet_ip(self._cidr, ip_address):
        raise ipam_exc.InvalidIpForSubnet(
            subnet_id=self.subnet_manager.neutron_id,
            ip=ip_address)

def _generate_ip(self, context, prefer_next=False):
    """Generate an IP address from the set of available addresses."""
    return self._generate_ips(context, prefer_next, 1)[0]
```

### CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions: 253 

The code does not handle the case where the subnet has been deleted when trying to delete an IP allocation, which can lead to a DBReferenceError. To fix this issue, the code should catch the DBReferenceError and raise a more appropriate exception.

### Solution:

```python
def deallocate(self, address):
    # This is almost a no-op because the Neutron DB IPAM driver does not
    # delete IPAllocation objects at every deallocation. The only
    # operation it performs is to delete an IPRequest entry.
    try:
        count = self.subnet_manager.delete_allocation(
            self._context, address)
    except db_exc.DBReferenceError:
        raise ipam_exc.SubnetNotFound(
            subnet_id=self.subnet_manager.neutron_id,
            ip_address=address)
    # count can hardly be greater than 1, but it can be 0...
    if not count:
        raise ipam_exc.IpAddressAllocationNotFound(
            subnet_id=self.subnet_manager.neutron_id,
            ip_address=address)
```
