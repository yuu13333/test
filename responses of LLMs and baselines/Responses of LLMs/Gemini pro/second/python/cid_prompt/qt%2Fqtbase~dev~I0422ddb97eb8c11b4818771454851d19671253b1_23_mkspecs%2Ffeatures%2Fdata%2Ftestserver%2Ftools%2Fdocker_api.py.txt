1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):**
   - Line 112: The code uses `str_encode_hex` to encode a file into a hex string without proper input validation. An attacker could provide a malicious file that would be encoded and executed, leading to arbitrary code execution.
   - Solution: The code should validate the input file to ensure that it is from a trusted source and does not contain malicious content.

2. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):**
   - Line 163: The code exits with an error code of -1 if the docker build fails, but does not handle any other exceptions that may occur during the build process.
   - Solution: The code should handle exceptions and log them appropriately, but it should not exit with an error code if the build fails.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):**
   - Line 194: The code uses `check_call` to run a command without using `stdout=PIPE` or `stderr=PIPE`, which can lead to deadlocks if the child process produces a large amount of output.
   - Solution: The code should use `Popen` with the `communicate()` method to handle the output of the child process.

4. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):**
   - Line 208: The code ignores the return code of `docker_pipe.communicate()` when removing containers, which can lead to errors being overlooked.
   - Solution: The code should check the return code and log any errors that occur.

5. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):**
   - Line 112: The code uses `str_encode_hex` to encode a file into a hex string without neutralizing any special characters that could be interpreted by the shell, such as `;` or `|`.
   - Solution: The code should neutralize any special characters before encoding the file.

6. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):**
   - Line 112: The code uses `str_encode_hex` to encode a file into a hex string, but the function is not documented and its purpose is not clear.
   - Solution: The code should document the purpose of `str_encode_hex` and ensure that it is used consistently throughout the codebase.
