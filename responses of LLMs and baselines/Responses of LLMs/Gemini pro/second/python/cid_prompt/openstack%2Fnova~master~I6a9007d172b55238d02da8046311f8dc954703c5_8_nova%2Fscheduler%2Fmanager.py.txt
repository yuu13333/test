The following security defects are detected in the code:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: Line 180: The `update_aggregates` method does not validate the user's permission to perform aggregate update, making it vulnerable to unauthorized aggregate modifications.
2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: Line 188: The `delete_aggregate` method does not handle the case where an aggregate is still in use by hosts. Deleting such an aggregate can lead to data inconsistences and scheduling issues.
3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: Line 195: The `update_instance_info` method does not verify if the provided instance_info is valid. Providing invalid instance information can disrupt the scheduler's functionality.
4. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: Line 202: The `delete_instance_info` method does not check if the instance_uuid provided actually exists on the host. Deleting non-existent instance information can leave the scheduler in an inconsistent state.
5. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: Line 144: The comparison of `res` with `None` to handle the case of a failed connection to the Placement service is incorrect. `res` can be `None` even when the connection to the Placement service is successful. Instead, the code should check for `alloc_reqs` being empty to determine if the Placement service returned candidates.
6. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: Line 148: When no allocation candidates are received from the Placement service, the code raises an exception without providing a meaningful reason. The exception message should provide more details about the cause of the failure.
7. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: Line 167: When `return_objects` is False, the code converts the Selection objects to a list of dicts without properly neutralizing any potential malicious input that may have been received in the `request_spec` or `filter_properties` arguments.
8. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: Throughout the code, there are several instances where the coding standards are not adhered to, including missing docstrings for some methods and incorrect indentation in certain places.
