The following security defects are found in the code:

1. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: Line 233: `ip = (netaddr.IPNetwork(self.primary_vip_range).network + self.vrouter_id)`
   - The code is using integer addition to combine the network address and the vrouter ID, which can lead to incorrect results if the network address is not an integer. To fix this, the code should use the `netaddr.IPAddress` class to perform the addition:
   - Fixed code: `ip = netaddr.IPAddress(netaddr.IPNetwork(self.primary_vip_range).network) + self.vrouter_id`

2. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: Line 253: `if self.vips:`
   - The code is checking if the `self.vips` list is not empty, but it is not using the correct operator. The correct operator to use is `if self.vips:`.
   - Fixed code: `if self.vips:`

3. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: Line 499: `cmd = {4: 'ping', 6: 'ping6'}.get(netaddr.IPAddress(ip_addr).version)`
   - The code is using the `get` method of the dictionary to retrieve the value for the key corresponding to the version of the IP address. However, the `get` method returns `None` if the key does not exist, which could cause the code to fail. To fix this, the code should use the `setdefault` method of the dictionary to ensure that a default value is returned if the key does not exist.
   - Fixed code: `cmd = {4: 'ping', 6: 'ping6'}.setdefault(netaddr.IPAddress(ip_addr).version)`
