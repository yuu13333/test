The following security defects are detected in the code:
1.**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - Line 86: The `time.sleep` function is used to introduce a delay in the execution of the `fake_rebuild` function. This delay is not necessary and can be removed.
   - Solution: Remove the `time.sleep` function call.

2.**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
   - Line 160: The `assertEqual` function is used to compare the `host` attribute of two servers. However, the `host` attribute is a string, and the `assertEqual` function is not designed to compare strings.
   - Solution: Use the `assertEquals` function instead of the `assertEqual` function.

3.**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
   - Line 170: The `assertNotIn` function is used to check if a value is not in a set. However, the `assertNotIn` function is not a standard Python function.
   - Solution: Use the `notin` operator instead of the `assertNotIn` function.
