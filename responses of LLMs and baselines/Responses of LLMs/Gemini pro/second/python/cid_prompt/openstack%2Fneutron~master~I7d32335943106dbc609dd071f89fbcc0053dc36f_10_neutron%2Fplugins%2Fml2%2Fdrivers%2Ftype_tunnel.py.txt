1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - Line 46: The `add_endpoint` method lacks proper access control checks to prevent unauthorized users from adding endpoints. An attacker could exploit this to add endpoints that redirect traffic or perform other malicious actions.

2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - Line 66: The `get_endpoint_by_host` method does not handle the case where the endpoint is not found in the database. This could lead to the endpoint being reused by a different host, resulting in a conflict.

3. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
   - Line 116: The `_parse_tunnel_ranges` method does not handle the case where the tunnel range is not properly formatted. This could lead to errors when attempting to allocate segments.

4. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
   - Line 140: The `validate_provider_segment` method incorrectly uses the `==` operator to compare values. The correct operator to use for string comparison is `==`.
