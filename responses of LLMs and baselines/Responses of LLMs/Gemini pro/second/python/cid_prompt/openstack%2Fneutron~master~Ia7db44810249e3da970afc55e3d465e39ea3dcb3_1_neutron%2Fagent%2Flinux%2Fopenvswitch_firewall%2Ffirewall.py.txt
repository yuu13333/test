1.CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
    In Line 36, when flows are replaced with register numbers, there is a possible neutralization issue if 'register_value' does not correctly neutralize the values of the replaced keys.
    Solution: Ensuring 'register_value' is correctly neutralized based on application-specific context and input validation.
2.CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
    In Line 344, if the port does not exist (an ovs_port is not found), it is not handled properly and an error is not raised.
    Solution: Raising an exception or returning an error code when the port does not exist to ensure proper error handling and resource management.
3.CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
    In Line 386, initializing egress flows is dependent on initializing egress IPv6 ICMP flows, which may not be applicable in all cases. This could lead to incomplete or incorrect flow initialization.
    Solution: Refactoring the code to avoid such dependencies and ensure that all necessary flow initialization steps are performed correctly.
