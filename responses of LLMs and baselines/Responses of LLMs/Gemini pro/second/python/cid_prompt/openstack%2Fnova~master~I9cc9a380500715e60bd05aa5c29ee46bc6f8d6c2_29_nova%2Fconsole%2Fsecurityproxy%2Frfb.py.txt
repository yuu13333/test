1. **CWE-693** (Protection Mechanism Failure): 
     - Line 119: `permitted_auth_types_cnt = six.byte2int(recv(compute_sock, 1))`
     - The code assumes that the length of the permitted_auth_types_cnt received from the compute_sock is always 1. This assumption could lead to an error if the length of the received data is different than expected.
     - Solution: Add a check to ensure the length of the received data is 1, and handle the case where it is not appropriately.


2. **CWE-697** (Incorrect Comparison):
    - Line 146: `if client_auth != auth.AuthType.NONE:`
    - The code compares client_auth with auth.AuthType.NONE using != instead of ==. This comparison could lead to an error if client_auth is equal to auth.AuthType.NONE.
    - Solution: Change the comparison to == to check if client_auth is equal to auth.AuthType.NONE.


3. **CWE-691** (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
    - Line 174: `compute_sock = scheme.security_handshake(compute_sock)`
    - The code calls scheme.security_handshake() without handling the possible exceptions that could be raised by the function. This could lead to the code crashing if an exception is raised.
    - Solution: Add a try/except block to handle the possible exceptions that could be raised by scheme.security_handshake().
