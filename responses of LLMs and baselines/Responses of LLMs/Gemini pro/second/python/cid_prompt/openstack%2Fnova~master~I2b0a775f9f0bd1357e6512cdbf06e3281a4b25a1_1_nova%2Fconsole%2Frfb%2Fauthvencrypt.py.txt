1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**:
   - **Line 143**: The code uses `ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` to set the SSL version to TLSv1.2. However, this does not enforce that the server must use TLSv1.2. An attacker could send a TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1 client hello, which would be accepted by the server. This could allow an attacker to downgrade the security of the connection.
   - **Solution**: Change `ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` to `ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2 | ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_1 | ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1` to require that the server use TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1, or TLSv1.0.
2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
   - **Line 136**: The code calls `ssl.wrap_socket()` to create a new SSL socket. However, it does not close the SSL socket after it is finished with it. This could lead to a resource leak.
   - **Solution**: Add a `finally` block to close the SSL socket after it is finished with it.
3. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**:
   - **Line 140**: The code calls `certfile=client_cert` to set the client certificate file. However, it does not check if the client certificate file exists or is valid. This could allow an attacker to use an invalid client certificate to authenticate to the server.
   - **Solution**: Check if the client certificate file exists and is valid before calling `certfile=client_cert`.
