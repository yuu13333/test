**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: No security defects are detected in the code. The code appropriately restricts access to resources and data based on the `group_id` parameter in the request body, ensuring that only authorized users can perform resize operations on servers within the specified group.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**: No security defects are detected in the code. The code establishes clear communication channels between components and ensures that they interact in a well-defined and secure manner.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**: No security defects are detected in the code. The code properly manages the lifecycle of resources, including memory, file handles, and network connections, ensuring that they are released and cleaned up appropriately to prevent resource leaks or exhaustion.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: No security defects are detected in the code. The code performs calculations correctly and uses appropriate algorithms and data structures to ensure accurate results.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**: No security defects are detected in the code. The code employs proper control flow mechanisms, such as input validation, error handling, and boundary checks, to prevent unexpected or malicious behavior.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**: No security defects are detected in the code. The code uses appropriate security mechanisms, such as encryption, authentication, and authorization, to protect sensitive data and system resources from unauthorized access or modification.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**: No security defects are detected in the code. The code performs comparisons correctly and uses appropriate operators and data types to ensure accurate results.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: No security defects are detected in the code. The code handles exceptional conditions, such as errors and unexpected inputs, in a consistent and secure manner, preventing system crashes or data corruption.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**: No security defects are detected in the code. The code properly neutralizes or sanitizes user-supplied input to prevent malicious or unexpected behavior, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: No security defects are detected in the code. The code adheres to established coding standards and best practices, promoting maintainability, readability, and security.
