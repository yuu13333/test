There is a potential security defect in the  line 278:

```python
# Some old versions of Linux and Windows agent expect trailing \n
# on password to work correctly.
enc_pass = dh.encrypt(new_pass + '\n')
```

The code encrypts the new password with a trailing newline character. However, this newline character is not removed before being sent to the agent, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the password field.

To fix this issue, the newline character should be removed from the password before it is encrypted. This can be done by replacing the above line with the following:

```python
enc_pass = dh.encrypt(new_pass.rstrip('\n'))
```
