### Line 146-148: Improper input validation
The input to the _set_read_deleted method is not properly validated. The following values are allowed: 'no', 'yes', 'only'. If an invalid value is provided, a ValueError is raised. However, this exception is not handled and can cause the program to crash. To fix this issue, the method should handle the ValueError and return an appropriate error message.

```python
def _set_read_deleted(self, read_deleted):
    if read_deleted not in ('no', 'yes', 'only'):
        raise ValueError(_("read_deleted can only be one of 'no', "
                            "'yes' or 'only', not %r") % read_deleted)
    self._read_deleted = read_deleted
```

### Line 311-312: Improper input validation
The input to the get_admin_context method is not properly validated. The read_deleted parameter can only be 'no', but this is not enforced by the method. If an invalid value is provided, it will be silently ignored and the method will return an admin context with the default read_deleted value of 'no'. To fix this issue, the method should validate the input and raise an exception if an invalid value is provided.

```python
def get_admin_context(read_deleted="no"):
    # NOTE(alaski): This method should only be used when an admin context is
    # necessary for the entirety of the context lifetime. If that's not the
    # case please use get_context(), or create the RequestContext manually, and
    # use context.elevated() where necessary. Some periodic tasks may use
    # get_admin_context so that their database calls are not filtered on
    # project_id.
    return RequestContext(user_id=None,
                          project_id=None,
                          is_admin=True,
                          read_deleted=read_deleted,
                          overwrite=False)
```
