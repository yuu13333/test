160         self.assertEqual(server1['OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host'],
161                          server2['OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host'])
162         # After the bug 1735407 is fixed the following is expected:
163         # self.assertNotEqual(server1['OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host'],
164         #                     server2['OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host'])

The code is making assertions about the placement of instances after an evacuation, but the assertions are incorrect. The `assertEqual` assertion is checking that the two instances are on the same host, which is not the desired behavior. The `assertNotEqual` assertion is checking that the two instances are on different hosts, which is the desired behavior.

The correct assertions should be:
```python
self.assertNotEqual(server1['OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host'],
                     server2['OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host'])
```
