Security defect present in the above code:

Line 100: SERVICE_PLUGINS_REQUIRED_DRIVERS is defined as a global variable and can be modified by calling services. This can lead to the inclusion of any driver in the extension_drivers list, potentially bypassing security restrictions.

To fix the security defect, SERVICE_PLUGINS_REQUIRED_DRIVERS should be defined as a constant and not a global variable so its value cannot be modified by plugins. This will ensure that only the intended drivers are included in the extension_drivers list.

Here's the modified code:

```python
SERVICE_PLUGINS_REQUIRED_DRIVERS = {
    'qos': [qos_ext.QOS_EXT_DRIVER_ALIAS]
}
```
