This code is for validating and extracting hardware compatibility constraints from Nova's flavors (resource profiles for VMs) and image metadata (in the Glance service) for NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) configurations when scheduling instances on NUMA hosts. It does not contain any security defects.
