CWE-117: Improper Restriction of Operations within a Loop

Line 76: `self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation(`

The code tries to assert that the flavor of the instance matches the resource provider allocation. However, the code does not check if the instance is present in the resource provider before making the assertion. An attacker could exploit this by creating an instance with a different flavor that does not exist in the resource provider, causing the assertion to fail.

Solution:

Add a check to ensure the instance is present in the resource provider before making the assertion.

```python
if instance in resource_provider:
    self.assertFlavorMatchesAllocation(
        self.flavor2, server['id'], dest_rp_uuid)
```
