**CWE-574: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions**

**Line 121:**

```python
try:
    utils.execute(*mount_cmd, run_as_root=True)
```

In this code, `utils.execute` is called without checking for errors. If the command fails, an exception will be raised. However, the code does not handle this exception properly. Instead, it simply deletes the mountpoint from the `mountpoints` dictionary and re-raises the exception. This can lead to data loss if the mountpoint contains any files that have not been backed up.


**Solution:**

To fix this issue, the code should check for errors when calling `utils.execute` and handle them appropriately. For example, the code could log the error and then attempt to unmount the mountpoint. If that fails, the code could raise an exception to indicate that the command failed.

```python
try:
    utils.execute(*mount_cmd, run_as_root=True)
except Exception as e:
    LOG.error(_LE("Failed to mount %(export)s on %(mountpoint)s: %(e)s"),
              {'export': export, 'mountpoint': mountpoint, 'e': e})
    if os.path.ismount(mountpoint):
        try:
            utils.execute('umount', mountpoint, run_as_root=True)
        except Exception as e:
            LOG.error(_LE("Failed to unmount %(mountpoint)s: %(e)s"),
                      {'mountpoint': mountpoint, 'e': e})
    raise
```

**CWE-22: Improper Input Validation**

**Line 113:**

```python
utils.execute('mkdir', '-p', mountpoint)
```

In this code, the `mkdir` command is called without validating the `mountpoint` parameter. This could allow an attacker to create a mountpoint in an arbitrary location, which could be used to mount a malicious file system.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, the code should validate the `mountpoint` parameter before calling `mkdir`. For example, the code could check that the mountpoint is a valid directory and that the user has permission to create a directory in that location.

```python
if not os.path.isdir(mountpoint):
    os.makedirs(mountpoint)
```
