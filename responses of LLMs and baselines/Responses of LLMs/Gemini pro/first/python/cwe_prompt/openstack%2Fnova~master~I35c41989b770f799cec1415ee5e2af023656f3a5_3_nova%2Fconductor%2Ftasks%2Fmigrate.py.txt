The following security defects are detected in the provided code:

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:
- Line 225: The code checks if the first host in the selection list is new enough to support resource request. If it's not, it removes the allocation from the first host and logs a debug message. However, it doesn't validate if the subsequent alternate hosts are new enough to support the resource request. This could lead to selecting an alternate host that doesn't support the resource request, resulting in a failed migration.

CWE-358: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('OS Command Injection'):
- Line 247: The code loads the allocation request from the selection object into a variable called 'alloc_req' using the jsonutils.loads() function. Proper input validation is not performed on the contents of the 'alloc_req' variable before it is used to claim resources, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious JSON data and execute arbitrary code on the system.

CWE-862: Missing Authorization Check:
- Line 378: The compute_rpcapi.prep_resize() method is called to start the migration process on the destination host. However, there is no authorization check in place to ensure that the user has permission to perform this operation. This could allow an unauthorized user to initiate a migration without proper authorization.

Recommendations for fixing the security defects:

1. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:
- Ensure that all alternate hosts in the selection list are new enough to support the resource request before selecting one.

2. CWE-358: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('OS Command Injection'):
- Properly validate the contents of the 'alloc_req' variable before using it to claim resources. This can be done by using a JSON schema to ensure that the data conforms to the expected format.

3. CWE-862: Missing Authorization Check:
- Implement an authorization check before calling the compute_rpcapi.prep_resize() method to ensure that the user has permission to perform the migration operation. This could be done by checking the user's role or permissions against a predefined set of rules.
