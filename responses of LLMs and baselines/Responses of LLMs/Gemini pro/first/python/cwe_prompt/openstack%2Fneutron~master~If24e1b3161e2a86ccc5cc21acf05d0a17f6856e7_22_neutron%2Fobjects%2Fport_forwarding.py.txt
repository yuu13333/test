**CWE-200: Information Exposure** 

**Line Number**: 133

**Description**: The code iterates over a query result and yields the values for `router_id`, `floating_ip_address`, `id`, and `id` for each row in the result set. However, the `id` value is yielded twice for each row, which could potentially expose sensitive information about the database schema or implementation details of the application.

**Solution**: Update line 133 to only yield the necessary values without duplicating the `id` field:

```python
yield (row[1]['router_id'], row[1]['floating_ip_address'], row[0]['id'])
```

**CWE-356: Password Storage**

**Line Number**: 73-89

**Description**: The code utilizes the `_load_attr_from_fip` method to load certain attributes (`floating_ip_address` and `router_id`) from a `FloatingIP` object based on the `floatingip_id` field. This method retrieves the `FloatingIP` object using the `_get_fip_obj` method, which elevates the context to allow access to potentially sensitive information. However, no additional security checks are performed before loading the attributes, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Solution**: Implement proper access control checks before loading the attributes from the `FloatingIP` object to ensure that only authorized users can access this information. For example, you could add a check to verify that the user making the request has the appropriate permissions to access the `FloatingIP` object's attributes.

**CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')**

**Line Number**: 86

**Description**: The code blindly sets the value of `attrname` to the value obtained from the `FloatingIP` object without any validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to an open redirect vulnerability if an attacker is able to control the value of `attrname` and redirect users to a malicious website.

**Solution**: Implement proper input validation and sanitization to ensure that the value of `attrname` is safe before setting it. For example, you could use regular expressions to validate the format of the `attrname` value and reject any values that appear suspicious.
