**CWE-338: Use of Insecure Randomness**

Line 213:
```python
self.admin_api.post_server_action(server['id'], {'evacuate': {}})
```

**Description:** The code is using the `evacuate` API to perform a live migration of a server without providing a `target_host` parameter. This allows the system to randomly select a destination host, which could potentially lead to the server being migrated to a host that is not suitable for its needs or that does not have the necessary resources. This could result in performance issues or even downtime for the server.

**Solution:** The code should be modified to specify the `target_host` parameter when calling the `evacuate` API. This will ensure that the server is migrated to a specific host that meets its requirements. The following code shows how to specify the `target_host` parameter:

```python
target_host = 'host2'
self.admin_api.post_server_action(server['id'], {'evacuate': {'target_host': target_host}})
```
