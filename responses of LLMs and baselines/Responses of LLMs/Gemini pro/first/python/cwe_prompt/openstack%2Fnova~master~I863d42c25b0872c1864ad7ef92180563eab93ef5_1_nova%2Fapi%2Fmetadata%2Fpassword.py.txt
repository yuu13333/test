**CWE-200: 'Information Exposure'**

* **CWE Description:**
  CWE-200 refers to the improper protection of sensitive information, leading to its unauthorized disclosure or access. This can occur due to weak encryption algorithms, insecure data storage practices, or inadequate access controls.


* **Line Number:**
  Line 51


* **Details:**
  The chunk_size is hard-coded to 255 bytes and the password is split into chunks of this size. This limit is not securely constrained and an attacker could potentially bypass this restriction by sending a password that is longer than the chunk length. This could lead to the entire password being stored in a single chunk, exposing sensitive information.


* **Solution:**
  To mitigate this security defect, you should ensure that the chunk size is securely constrained and that the password is split into chunks that are of reasonable length. This can be done by dynamically calculating the chunk size based on the length of the password or by using a secure random number generator to determine the chunk size.


* **Additional Notes:**
  - The use of hard-coded values, such as the chunk size, can introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly constrained.
  - Sensitive data, such as passwords, should be protected using appropriate encryption techniques and access controls.
  - Always consider the potential security implications when working with sensitive information.
