CWE-305: Improper Certificate Validation

The code in question uses ssl.wrap_socket() to establish a TLS connection with the server. The `cert_reqs` parameter is set to `ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`, which means the server's certificate will be validated. However, the `ca_certs` parameter is not set, which means that the server's certificate cannot be verified against any trusted certificate authorities.

In order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, it is necessary to validate the server's certificate. This can be done by setting the `ca_certs` parameter to a list of trusted certificate authorities.

Line 143:
```python
ca_certs=CONF.vnc.vencrypt_ca_certs,
```

Solution:
```python
ca_certs='/path/to/trusted/certificate/authorities',
```
