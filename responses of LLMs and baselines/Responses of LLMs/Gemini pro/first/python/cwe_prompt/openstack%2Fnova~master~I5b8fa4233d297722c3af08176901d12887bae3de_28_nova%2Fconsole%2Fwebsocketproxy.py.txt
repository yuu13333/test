**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**

- Line 80:

> ` if sys.version_info < (2, 7, 4):`

The code checks if the Python version is less than 2.7.4 and raises an exception when it is. This is a version check that is not related to any security issue and should not be used to raise an exception.

**Solution:**

Remove the version check and the exception.

- Line 130:

> ` if origin_hostname == '' or origin_scheme == '':`

The code checks if the origin hostname or scheme is empty and raises an exception when it is. This is a security issue because it allows an attacker to spoof the origin of a WebSocket connection, which could allow them to bypass security restrictions.

**Solution:**

The code should check the origin hostname and scheme against a list of allowed values. For example:

> ` if origin_hostname not in CONF.console.allowed_origins or origin_scheme not in ['http', 'https']:`

- Line 133:

> ` if origin_hostname not in expected_origin_hostnames:`

The code checks if the origin hostname is not in the list of allowed origins and raises an exception when it is. This is a security issue because it allows an attacker to spoof the origin of a WebSocket connection, which could allow them to bypass security restrictions.

**Solution:**

The code should check the origin hostname against a list of allowed values. For example:

> ` if origin_hostname not in CONF.console.allowed_origins:`

- Line 136:

> ` if not self.verify_origin_proto(connect_info, origin_scheme):`

The code checks if the origin scheme is not in the list of allowed protocols and raises an exception when it is. This is a security issue because it allows an attacker to spoof the origin of a WebSocket connection, which could allow them to bypass security restrictions.

**Solution:**

The code should check the origin scheme against a list of allowed values. For example:

> ` if origin_scheme not in ['http', 'https']:`
