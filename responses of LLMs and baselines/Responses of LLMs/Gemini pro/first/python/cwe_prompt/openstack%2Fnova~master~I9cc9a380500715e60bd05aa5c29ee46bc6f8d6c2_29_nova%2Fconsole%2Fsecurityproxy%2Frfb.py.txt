CWE-611: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

Line 86:
```python
def recv(sock, num):
    b = sock.recv(num)
```

The `recv` function receives data from a socket without specifying the buffer size, allowing for the possibility of buffer overflow or underflow, depending on the implementation of the `recv` method. This can lead to memory corruption or denial of service attacks.

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Line 121:
```python
if permitted_auth_types_cnt == 0:
```

This line checks if `permitted_auth_types_cnt` is equal to 0 without validating the input for negative values or non-integer values. Negative values could lead to an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior, while non-integer values could lead to incorrect logic.

CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')

Line 123:
```python
reason_len = struct.unpack('!I', reason_len_raw)[0]
```

This line unpacks a 4-byte integer from `reason_len_raw` without validating the input for negative values or values greater than the size of `reason_len_raw`. Negative values could lead to an out-of-bounds read, while values larger than the size of `reason_len_raw` could lead to a buffer overflow.

Additionally, the code does not appear to handle authentication failures properly. If authentication fails, it should send an appropriate error message to the client and close the connection. The code should also be reviewed for other security issues, such as input validation, buffer overflow, and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
