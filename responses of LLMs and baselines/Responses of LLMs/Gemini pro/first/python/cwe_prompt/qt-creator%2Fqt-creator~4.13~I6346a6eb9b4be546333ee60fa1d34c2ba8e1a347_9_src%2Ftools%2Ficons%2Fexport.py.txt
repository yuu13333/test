1. **CWE-78: OS Command Injection** (Line 102)

   - The code uses subprocess.Popen to execute the Inkscape command-line tool. The command is constructed dynamically based on user-provided input (`svgIDs`, `svgFile`, `scaleFactors`, and `inkscape`) without proper input validation. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the Inkscape process, leading to remote code execution or other security vulnerabilities.

   - **Solution:** Use a more secure method of executing external commands, such as the subprocess.run() function with the `shell=False` argument, which prevents shell metacharacters from being interpreted as commands. Additionally, implement proper input validation to ensure that the user-provided input does not contain malicious characters or commands.

2. **CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** (Line 117)

   - The code uses print() to display information about the export process, including the number of SVG IDs and scale factors being used. However, the output is not properly sanitized, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks if the output is displayed in a web application or other context where it can be interpreted as HTML.

   - **Solution:** Use a templating or sanitization mechanism to ensure that the output is properly escaped before being displayed. Sanitization involves removing or encoding any potentially malicious characters from the output to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML or script code.

3. **CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')** (Line 103)

   - The code uses subprocess.Popen to execute the Inkscape command-line tool. The command is constructed dynamically based on user-provided input (`svgIDs`, `svgFile`, `scaleFactors`, and `inkscape`) without proper input validation. This can allow an attacker to inject a malicious URL into the Inkscape command, potentially redirecting the user to an untrusted or malicious website.

   - **Solution:** Use a more secure method of executing external commands, such as the subprocess.run() function with the `shell=False` argument, which prevents shell metacharacters from being interpreted as commands. Additionally, implement proper input validation to ensure that the user-provided input does not contain malicious characters or URLs.
