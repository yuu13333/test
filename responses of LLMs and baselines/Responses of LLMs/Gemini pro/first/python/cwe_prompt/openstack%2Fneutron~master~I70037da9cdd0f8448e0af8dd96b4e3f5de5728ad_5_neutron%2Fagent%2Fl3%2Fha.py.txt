**CWE-644: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type**

* **Line Number(s):** 236
* **Details:** The code uses `fileutils.ensure_tree()` function to create the HA configuration path. This function doesn't restrict the type of files that can be uploaded, which makes it vulnerable to unrestricted file upload attacks. An attacker can potentially upload malicious files with dangerous file types, leading to arbitrary code execution or data manipulation.

**Solution:** Implement proper input validation to restrict the types of files that can be uploaded. Use a dedicated module or library that provides file type validation mechanisms, such as `imghdr` or `magic`.


**CWE-30: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**

* **Line Number(s):** 236
* **Details:** The code uses the `fileutils.ensure_tree()` function to create the HA configuration path. This function doesn't provide any encryption or hashing for the files it creates, making it vulnerable to data breaches and security compromises. An attacker with access to the system can potentially read or modify the HA configuration files, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or altering the router configurations.

**Solution:** Implement proper encryption or hashing mechanisms to protect the HA configuration files. Consider using industry-standard encryption algorithms like AES-256 or SHA-256 to secure the files and prevent unauthorized access.
