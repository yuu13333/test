**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**
CWE-20 occurs when an application does not validate user input correctly.

**Line 144:** The `policy.enforce` function is called without checking the validity of the input parameters. This could potentially allow an attacker to pass in invalid values and cause the application to crash or behave in an unexpected way.

**CWE-22: Path Traversal**
CWE-22 occurs when an application processes user input that contains special characters, such as "../", which can be used to traverse the file system and access unauthorized files.

**Line 196:** The `policy.check` function is called without checking the validity of the input parameters. This could potentially allow an attacker to pass in special characters and gain access to unauthorized resources.

**CWE-200: Information Exposure**
CWE-200 occurs when an application releases sensitive information to an unauthorized party.

**Line 206:** When an authorization error occurs, the application sets the HTTP status code to 404 (Not Found) and returns an empty response. This could potentially leak information to an attacker about the existence of resources that they should not have access to.

**Solution:**
**CWE-20:** To address CWE-20, the application should validate the input parameters of the `policy.enforce` and `policy.check` functions before calling them. This can be done by using a library that provides input validation, such as the `jsonschema` library.

**CWE-22:** To address CWE-22, the application should sanitize the input parameters of the `policy.enforce` and `policy.check` functions before calling them. This can be done by using a library that provides input sanitization, such as the `bleach` library.

**CWE-200:** To address CWE-200, the application should return a more generic error message when an authorization error occurs. For example, the application could return a message like "You do not have permission to access this resource."
