There are two security defects detected in the code:

1. CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') (Line 149): The code attempts to retrieve a port based on a port ID obtained from the 'returned_obj' dictionary. However, this dictionary can be manipulated by an attacker to redirect the request to an arbitrary URL. This can lead to an open redirect attack, where the attacker can trick a user into clicking a malicious link that redirects them to a malicious website.

2. CWE-287: Improper Authentication (Line 168): The code attempts to retrieve a port based on a port ID obtained from the 'original_object' dictionary. However, this dictionary can be manipulated by an attacker to provide an arbitrary port ID. This can lead to an improper authentication attack, where the attacker can access information about ports that they should not have access to.

To fix these security defects:

- For CWE-601, always validate that the port ID obtained from the 'returned_obj' dictionary is valid and belongs to the expected resource.

- For CWE-287, always validate that the port ID obtained from the 'original_object' dictionary is valid and belongs to the expected resource.
