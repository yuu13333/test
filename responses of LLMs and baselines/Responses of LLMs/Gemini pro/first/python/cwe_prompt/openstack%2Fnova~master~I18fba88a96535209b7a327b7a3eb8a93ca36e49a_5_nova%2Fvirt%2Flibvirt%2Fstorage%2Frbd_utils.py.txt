1. CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
   - Line 302: `with RADOSClient(self, self.pool) as client:`
   
   - In Python, the "with" statement is used to ensure that resources are properly managed, such as acquiring and releasing a lock or opening and closing a file. In this case, it is being used to establish a connection to a Ceph RADOS client. However, the connection parameters, such as the pool name and credentials, are passed as plain text arguments to the `RADOSClient` constructor, making them visible to anyone who has access to the code or the process memory.

   - Solution: Use a secure communication channel or encrypt the connection parameters before passing them to the `RADOSClient` constructor.


2. CWE-362: Race Condition
   - Line 365: `timer = loopingcall.FixedIntervalLoopingCall(...)`

   - A race condition exists in the code where the timer for retrying the volume removal is started before the looping call's `_cleanup_vol` function is defined. This can lead to the timer function being called with an invalid function reference, resulting in an exception and potentially disrupting the volume removal process.

   - Solution: Ensure that the looping call function is defined before starting the timer to avoid the race condition.
