1. Line 126: CWE-362 (Race Condition):
   The code does not properly handle the case where the device might be removed while the function is running. This can lead to a race condition where the code attempts to interact with a non-existent device.
   Solution: Add a check to ensure that the device still exists before performing any operations on it.

2. Line 162: CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value):
   The code does not properly handle the case where the 'delete_ip_address' function raises a NetlinkError with the code 'EADDRNOTAVAIL'. This can lead to the function failing to delete the IP address and not providing any feedback to the caller.
   Solution: Catch the NetlinkError and return appropriately.

3. Line 216: CWE-362 (Race Condition):
   Similar to the issue in Line 126, the code does not properly handle the case where the namespace might be removed while the function is running. This can lead to a race condition where the code attempts to interact with a non-existent namespace.
   Solution: Add a check to ensure that the namespace still exists before performing any operations on it.
