    ```
    The function `remove_image` doesn't check if the volume is in use before removing it. This could lead to data loss if the volume is in use by a running instance.

    The code doesn't handle the case when the volume has snapshots. This could lead to data loss if the volume is removed with snapshots present.

    The code doesn't handle the case when the volume is busy or has snapshots. This could lead to data loss if the volume is removed while it is in use or has snapshots.

    ```python
    def rollback_to_snap(self, volume, name):
        """Revert an RBD volume to its contents at a snapshot.

            else:
                raise exception.SnapshotNotFound(snapshot_id=name)
    ```
    The code checks if the snapshot name is present in the list of snapshots by comparing it to the `name` attribute of each snapshot. However, it doesn't check if the snapshot exists or if it is valid. This could lead to an exception being raised when trying to roll back to a non-existent or invalid snapshot.
