There is one CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards) defect in the code. The issue can be found at 156:
```python
156         sys.exit("{} does not match any Id.".format(args.filter))
```
This code does not handle the case where the args.filter is empty, which can lead to an IndexError. The correct way to handle this case is to check if the args.filter is empty before using it in the format string:
```python
156         if not args.filter:
157             sys.exit("Empty filter")
158         elif "{} does not match any Id.".format(args.filter):
159             sys.exit("{} does not match any Id.".format(args.filter))
```
