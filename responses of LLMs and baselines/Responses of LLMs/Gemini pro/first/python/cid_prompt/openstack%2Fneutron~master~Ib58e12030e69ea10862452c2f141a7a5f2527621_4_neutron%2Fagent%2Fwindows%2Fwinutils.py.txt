1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
   - Line 379: The `close()` method of the `HandleClass` class closes all the handles used by the named pipe, but it does not check if the named pipe is valid before closing the handles. This could lead to an improper access control vulnerability if the named pipe is no longer valid or has been closed by another process.
   - Solution: Add a check to ensure that the named pipe is valid before closing the handles.

2. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
   - Line 602: The `wait()` method uses the `WaitForSingleObject()` function to wait for the child process to terminate. However, it does not handle the case where the `WaitForSingleObject()` function returns an error code other than `WAIT_TIMEOUT`. This could lead to an incorrect calculation of the child process's exit code.
   - Solution: Add error handling for the `WaitForSingleObject()` function to ensure that the child process's exit code is correctly calculated.

3. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)
   - Line 155: The `_wait_event()` method uses the `WaitForMultipleObjects()` function to wait for an event to be signaled. However, it does not handle the case where the `WaitForMultipleObjects()` function returns an error code other than `WAIT_TIMEOUT`. This could lead to insufficient control flow management and potentially cause the program to crash.
   - Solution: Add error handling for the `WaitForMultipleObjects()` function to ensure that the program does not crash if an error occurs.
