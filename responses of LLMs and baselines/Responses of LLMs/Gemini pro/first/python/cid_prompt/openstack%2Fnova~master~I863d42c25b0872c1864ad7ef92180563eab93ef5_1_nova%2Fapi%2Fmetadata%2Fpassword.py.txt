**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

1. Line 59-60: In the 'GET' method, anyone can access the password stored as system metadata without proper authentication or authorization. It allows unauthorized users to retrieve sensitive information.

**Solution**: Implement access control checks in the `handle_password` function to ensure that only authorized users can access the instance metadata.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

1. Line 34: The `utils.instance_sys_meta` method is deprecated, and using deprecated functions can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

**Solution**: Update the code to use the proper method to access instance system metadata.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**

1. Line 77: The exception handling for `InstanceNotFound` is not ideal. Raising an `HTTPBadRequest` exception in this case is not appropriate, as it suggests that the user made an incorrect request.

**Solution**: Use a more appropriate exception type, such as `InstanceNotFound` or `HTTPNotFound`, to handle this case.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**

1. Line 50: The initialization of the `meta` dictionary is redundant and unnecessary. It should be initialized only if the password is not empty.

**Solution**: Initialize the `meta` dictionary only if `password` is not empty to avoid unnecessary memory allocation.
