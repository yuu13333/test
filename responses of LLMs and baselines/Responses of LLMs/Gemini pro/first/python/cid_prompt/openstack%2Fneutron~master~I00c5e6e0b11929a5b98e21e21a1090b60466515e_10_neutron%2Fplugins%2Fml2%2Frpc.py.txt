1.CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
   - Line 77: get_device_details RPC method does not perform any access control checks on the agent making the request. This could allow unauthorized agents to obtain information about devices that they should not have access to.


2.CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
   - Line 280: The code does not properly handle the case where the port is not found in the database. This could lead to exceptions and unexpected behavior.


3.CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
   - Line 202: The code does not properly handle exceptions that may occur while getting device details. This could lead to failures in updating the port status and returning incorrect information to the agent.


4.CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
   - Line 140: The code uses a bare except block, which catches all exceptions without any discrimination. This is a bad practice and can mask errors that should be handled differently.
