Line 505: The code incorrectly removes the UNKNOWN_ADDR from the addresses list when the port security is enabled and the port type is not set. This can lead to incorrect address configuration for the port.
Solution: Add a check to ensure that the UNKNOWN_ADDR is not removed when the port security is enabled and the port type is not set.

CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):

Line 258: The code does not properly handle the case where the OVN object is not found. It should either raise an exception or log an error message.
