1.CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) at line 150. The mountpoint is deleted without ensuring that it is no longer in use. If the mountpoint is still in use, it can lead to data loss or corruption.
Solution: Ensure that the mountpoint is no longer in use before deleting it. This can be done by checking if there are any processes that are still using the mountpoint.

2.CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions) at line 122. The code does not handle the case where the mount command fails. This can lead to the mountpoint being left in an inconsistent state.
Solution: Handle the case where the mount command fails by catching the exception and rolling back any changes that were made.

3.CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards) at line 50. The code uses the `continue` statement to skip the remaining code in the loop. This can make the code difficult to read and understand.
Solution: Use the `break` statement instead of the `continue` statement to exit the loop early.
