1. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
   - Line 185: The code does not properly handle the case where the Floating IP (FIP) namespace is not empty when the namespace is being deleted. This could lead to orphaned interfaces or routes.
   - Solution: Add a check to ensure that the FIP namespace is empty before deleting it.

2. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
   - Line 234: The code adds a default gateway to the FIP device without properly neutralizing the input. This could allow an attacker to specify a malicious gateway IP address, leading to routing issues.
   - Solution: Validate the gateway IP address before adding it to the FIP device.

3. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
   - Line 280: The code uses the `ip_version` variable to determine the table index for adding the default gateway. However, `ip_version` is not defined or initialized anywhere in the code.
   - Solution: Properly define and initialize the `ip_version` variable.
