The following security defects are detected in the code:

1. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)** (Line 128):
   - The `put_service` API call to force the compute service down does not handle any potential exceptions or errors that may occur during the operation. This can lead to unexpected behavior or data inconsistencies if the API call fails.

2. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)** (Line 191):
   - The code uses a custom function `slow_drop` to introduce a sleep delay in the `Instance.drop_migration_context` method. This is a non-standard approach and can make it difficult to understand the intended behavior of the code.

3. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)** (Line 203):
   - Similarly, the code uses a custom function `slow_get_mig` to introduce a sleep delay in the `MigrationList.get_in_progress_and_error` method. This is also a non-standard approach and can make it difficult to understand the intended behavior of the code.

To resolve these defects, you should:

1. **CWE-703**: Add proper error handling to the `put_service` API call to ensure that any exceptions or errors are handled gracefully.

2. **CWE-710**: Use standard methods or techniques to introduce delays or sleeps in the code, rather than creating custom functions for this purpose. This will improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
