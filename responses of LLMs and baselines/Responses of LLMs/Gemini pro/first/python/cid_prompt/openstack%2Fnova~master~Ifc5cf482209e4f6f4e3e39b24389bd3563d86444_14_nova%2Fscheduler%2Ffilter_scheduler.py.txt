1. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
   - In the `_claim_resources` method, the `placement_client.claim_resources` call may fail due to a failure in the Placement API or a conflict with another resource claim. However, the method does not handle this failure case and does not release the resources that were successfully claimed for the instance. This can lead to a situation where resources are locked indefinitely in the Placement API, preventing other instances from using them.
   - **Solution**: Add error handling to the `_claim_resources` method to release the resources if the claim fails.
   - **Line Numbers**: 283-290

2. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
   - In the `_get_all_host_states` method, the `host_manager.get_host_states_by_uuids` call may fail due to a failure in the Placement API or another unexpected error. However, the method does not handle this failure case and does not return an error or an empty list of host states. This can lead to problems in the subsequent scheduling process, as it may try to use invalid or incomplete host state information.
   - **Solution**: Add error handling to the `_get_all_host_states` method to return an error or an empty list of host states if the call to `host_manager.get_host_states_by_uuids` fails.
   - **Line Numbers**: 335-336
