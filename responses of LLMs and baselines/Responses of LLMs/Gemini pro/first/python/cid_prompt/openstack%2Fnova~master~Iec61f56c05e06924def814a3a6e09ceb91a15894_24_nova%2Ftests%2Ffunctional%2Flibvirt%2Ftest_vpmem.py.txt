1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):**
   - **Line 187:** The server1 is created with the flavor 'self.flavor' and the hostname 'self.compute1.host'. This line does not perform any access control checks, allowing any user to create a server with any flavor on any host.
   - **Line 191:** The server2 is created with the flavor 'self.flavor' and the hostname 'self.compute1.host'. This line also does not perform any access control checks.
   - **Line 197:** The server3 is created with the flavor 'self.flavor' and the hostname 'self.compute1.host'. This line also does not perform any access control checks.
   - **Line 202:** The server3 is created with the flavor 'self.flavor' and the hostname 'self.compute1.host'. This line also does not perform any access control checks.

2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):**
   - **Line 187:** The server1 is created on the compute1 host, but there is no check to ensure that the host has enough resources to support the server. This could lead to the server being created successfully but then failing to start due to a lack of resources.
   - **Line 191:** The server2 is created on the compute1 host, but there is no check to ensure that the host has enough resources to support the server. This could lead to the server being created successfully but then failing to start due to a lack of resources.
   - **Line 197:** The server3 is created on the compute1 host, but there is no check to ensure that the host has enough resources to support the server. This could lead to the server being created successfully but then failing to start due to a lack of resources.
   - **Line 202:** The server3 is created on the compute1 host, but there is no check to ensure that the host has enough resources to support the server. This could lead to the server being created successfully but then failing to start due to a lack of resources.

3. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**
   - **Line 197:** The server3 is created with the flavor 'self.flavor', which specifies a 'SMALL' VPMEM resource. However, the compute1 host only has one 'SMALL' VPMEM resource available, which is already allocated to server1. This will cause the server3 to fail to start due to a lack of resources.

4. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):**
   - **Line 243:** The flag 'allow_resize_to_same_host' is set to False, which means that servers cannot be resized to the same host. However, the code still allows the server to be resized to the same host in the test_resize_same_host() method. This is a protection mechanism failure because the code is not enforcing the flag setting.

Here are the suggested solutions for the detected security defects:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):**
   - **Line 187:** Add an access control check to ensure that the user has permission to create a server with the specified flavor on the specified host.
   - **Line 191:** Add an access control check to ensure that the user has permission to create a server with the specified flavor on the specified host.
   - **Line 197:** Add an access control check to ensure that the user has permission to create a server with the specified flavor on the specified host.
   - **Line 202:** Add an access control check to ensure that the user has permission to create a server with the specified flavor on the specified host.

2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):**
   - **Line 187:** Add a check to ensure that the compute1 host has enough resources to support the server1.
   - **Line 191:** Add a check to ensure that the compute1 host has enough resources to support the server2.
   - **Line 197:** Add a check to ensure that the compute1 host has enough resources to support the server3.
   - **Line 202:** Add a check to ensure that the compute1 host has enough resources to support the server3.

3. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**
   - **Line 197:** Modify the code to check the available 'SMALL' VPMEM resources on the compute1 host before creating the server3. If there are no available resources, the server3 should not be created.

4. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):**
   - **Line 243:** Remove the code that allows the server to be resized to the same host in the test_resize_same_host() method. The flag 'allow_resize_to_same_host' should be enforced to prevent servers from being resized to the same host.
