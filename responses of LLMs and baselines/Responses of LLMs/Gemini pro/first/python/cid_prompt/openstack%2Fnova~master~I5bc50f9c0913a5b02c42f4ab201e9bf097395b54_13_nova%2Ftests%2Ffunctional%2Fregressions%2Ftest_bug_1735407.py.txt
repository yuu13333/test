1. **CWE-362 : Race Condition** (Line 91)
   - The code simulates a race condition by introducing a delay in the rebuild process of one of the instances. This delay allows the rebuild of the other instance to finish before the validation of the first rebuild is complete. This can lead to incorrect behavior if the validation of the first rebuild fails.


2. **CWE-776 : Reliance on Unverified Input** (Line 103, 108)
   - The user input for the 'server' dictionary is not validated before it is used to create the server. This can lead to various security issues, such as the creation of malicious servers or the injection of malicious code into the system.

   **Solution**:
   - Validate the user input for the 'server' dictionary before using it to create the server.
