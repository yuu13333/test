There are 2 security defects found in the code:

1. **CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**

   - **Details:** This code from line 407 attempts to get the trunk object from the database using the `trunk_id` parameter. However, if the trunk is not found in the database, it does not handle the `TrunkNotFound` exception appropriately. This could lead to the code continuing to execute with an incorrect or incomplete dataset, which may result in unexpected behavior or errors.

   - **Recommendation:** Add a try-except block to gracefully handle the `TrunkNotFound` exception and return an appropriate error or exception to the caller. For example:
     ```python
     def _get_trunk(self, context, trunk_id):
         """Return the trunk object or raise if not found."""
         try:
             obj = trunk_objects.Trunk.get_object(context, id=trunk_id)
         except trunk_exc.TrunkNotFound:
             raise trunk_exc.TrunkNotFound(trunk_id=trunk_id)

         return obj
     ```

2. **CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison**

   - **Details:** This code in line 400 compares the `seg_id` with the `subports_ids` list to check if the `seg_id` is already in use. However, it uses the `not in` operator which is incorrect for this case. The correct comparison should be `seg_id in subports_ids` to check if the `seg_id` is present in the list.

   - **Recommendation:** Change the `not in` operator to `in` operator to correctly check if the `seg_id` is present in the `subports_ids` list.
     ```python
     def _get_seg_id(self, context, trunk_id):
         seg_ids = [x for x in range(constants.MIN_SEG_ID,
                                     constants.MAX_SEG_ID + 1)]
         shuffle(seg_ids)
         subports = self.get_subports(context, trunk_id)
         subports_ids = [x['segmentation_id'] for x in subports['sub_ports']]
         for seg_id in seg_ids:
             if seg_id in subports_ids:
                 continue
             return seg_id
         return None
     ```
