CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
  Line 344 compares a decoded string to a boolean value. This can result in unexpected behavior if the decoded string contains characters other than 'False' or 'True', as the comparison will always return False.

CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
  Line 168 does not log the exception properly and may result in errors being lost in the logs.

CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
  Line 277 does not properly neutralize the password before passing it to the agent. An attacker with access to the network traffic could potentially intercept and decrypt the password if it were transmitted in plaintext.

CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
  Line 344 does not follow the PEP 8 naming convention for variable names, as it uses underscores instead of camelCase. This can make the code more difficult to read and understand.
