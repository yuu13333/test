The following security defects are found in the code:

1. CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions (Line 237)
   - The code does not properly handle the case when the database session has already been rolled back before attempting to use it again. This can lead to errors and unpredictable behavior.

2. CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation (Line 110)
   - The code incorrectly formats the error message when a requested internal IP address is not suitable for the internal Neutron port. The error message uses a format string that is not properly formatted, which can lead to errors and incorrect error messages.

The following solutions are proposed:

1. For CWE-703:
   - Add a check to ensure that the database session is still valid before using it. If the session has been rolled back, reopen a new session before proceeding. This will help prevent errors and ensure that the code handles exceptional conditions correctly.

2. For CWE-682:
   - Use the correct format string to format the error message. This will ensure that the error message is properly formatted and provides accurate information to the user.
