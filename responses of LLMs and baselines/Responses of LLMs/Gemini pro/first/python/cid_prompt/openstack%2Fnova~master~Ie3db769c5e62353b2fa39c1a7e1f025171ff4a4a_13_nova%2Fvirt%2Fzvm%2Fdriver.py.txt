1. **CWE-284: Improper Access Control** (Line 114)

   The `_mapping_power_stat` method does not perform any access control checks before accessing the `ZVM_POWER_STAT` dictionary and converting the power state.

   Solution: Add appropriate access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the `ZVM_POWER_STAT` dictionary.

2. **CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure** (Line 124)

   The `get_info` method does not handle the case where the `_reqh.call` method raises an exception with an `overallRC` value of 404 (indicating that the instance does not exist). As a result, the method may incorrectly raise an exception or fail to return the correct power state for non-existent instances.

   Solution: Handle the case where the `_reqh.call` method raises an exception with an `overallRC` value of 404 and return an appropriate error message or status code.

3. **CWE-707: Improper Neutralization** (Line 144)

   The `instance_exists` method does not properly neutralize the input parameter `instance.name` before using it as a parameter to the `_instance_exists` method, which expects a string value. This could lead to potential security issues if the `instance.name` parameter is not a string.

   Solution: Properly neutralize the `instance.name` parameter by converting it to a string before passing it to the `_instance_exists` method.

4. **CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards** (Line 152, Line 347)

   The code contains two instances of string concatenation using the `+` operator, which is generally discouraged in Python due to potential security risks and readability issues.

   Solution: Use the `join` method or the `format` function to concatenate strings in a more secure and readable manner.
