1. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
   - Line 95: @messaging.expected_exceptions(exception.NoValidHost) is used to catch and handle a specific exception, but it is not properly securing the method against other potential exceptions. An attacker could exploit this by sending a malicious request that triggers an unhandled exception, potentially leading to a denial of service attack or compromise of sensitive information.

Solution:
   - Add a more comprehensive exception handling mechanism to the method to ensure proper handling and logging of all exceptions.

2. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
   - Line 187: The user context is dropped without proper validation or justification. This can lead to potential security risks as the context may contain sensitive information that should not be exposed.

Solution:
   - Review the logic and ensure proper validation and authorization checks are performed before dropping the user context. Consider using an impersonation mechanism to maintain the necessary level of access while mitigating security risks.
