1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
   - Line 135: The `mount_volume` function mounts the Quobyte volume using a hard-coded configuration file path stored in `CONF.libvirt.quobyte_client_cfg`. This configuration file may contain sensitive information such as credentials or other sensitive parameters. An attacker with access to the host system could potentially exploit this by accessing or modifying this configuration file, leading to unauthorized access or control over the Quobyte volume.
   - Solution: Instead of using a hard-coded configuration file, the function should allow the user to specify the path to the configuration file as an argument. This would allow administrators to store the configuration file in a more secure location and control access to it more effectively.

2. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
   - Line 60: The `LOG.info` statement logs the successful mounting of the volume with the message "Mounted volume: %s". This message includes the volume name, which could potentially contain sensitive information. If the host system is compromised, an attacker could gain access to this information by reading the log files.
   - Solution: To prevent the disclosure of sensitive information, the function should use a more generic message that does not include the volume name, such as "Volume mounted successfully".
