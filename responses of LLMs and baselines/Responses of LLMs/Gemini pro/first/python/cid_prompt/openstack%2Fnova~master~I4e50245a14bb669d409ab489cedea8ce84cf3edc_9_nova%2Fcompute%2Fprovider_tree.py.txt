1. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
   - Line 32: The function `_inventory_has_changed` checks if the inventory has changed by comparing the keys and values of two dictionaries. However, it does not handle the case where one of the dictionaries has additional keys that are not present in the other. This can happen when the inventory is updated with new fields that are not yet supported by the caller. The code should handle this case by explicitly checking for additional keys and returning True if they are found.
   - Solution: Add a check for additional keys in the `_inventory_has_changed` function.

2. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
   - Line 201: The function `inventory_changed` raises a `ValueError` if a provider with the supplied `name_or_uuid` is not found in the tree. However, it does not handle the case where the input `name_or_uuid` is invalid or not a string. This can lead to unexpected errors if the caller passes an invalid input.
   - Solution: Add validation to the `inventory_changed` function to ensure that the `name_or_uuid` is a valid string.

3. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
   - Line 227: The function `update_inventory` raises a `ValueError` if a provider with the supplied `name_or_uuid` is not found in the tree. However, it does not handle the case where the input `name_or_uuid` is invalid or not a string. This can lead to unexpected errors if the caller passes an invalid input.
   - Solution: Add validation to the `update_inventory` function to ensure that the `name_or_uuid` is a valid string.
