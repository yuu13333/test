1. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
   - Line number: 112-113
   - Description: The error handling in the `batch()` function is insufficient. If an error occurs during the execution of the deferred client calls, the agent's `resources_synced` attribute is not updated, which can lead to the agent being out of sync with the placement service.

   - Solution: Update the agent's `resources_synced` attribute even if an error occurs during the execution of the deferred client calls. This can be done by adding `try` and `except` blocks around the call to `deferred.execute()` and setting `resources_synced` to `False` if an exception is caught.
