1. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**

   - In the `update_segment_host_mapping` function, it assumes that the database transaction is atomic and that the segment host mappings will be deleted if there is an error. However, if there is an error after some of the mappings have been deleted, the remaining mappings will not be rolled back.
     - **Solution**: Use a single transaction to ensure that either all mappings are deleted or none are deleted.

2. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**

   - In the `_update_segment_host_mapping_for_agent` function, it checks if `host in reported_hosts` before updating the segment host mappings. However, it does not check if `host` is in the list of `hosts` that are passed as an argument to the function. This means that it is possible for a host to be added to the `reported_hosts` list without actually being mapped to any segments.
     - **Solution**: Add a check to ensure that `host` is in the list of `hosts` before updating the segment host mappings.

3. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**

   - In the `_add_segment_host_mapping_for_segment` function, it checks if `context.session.is_active` before adding the segment host mapping. However, it does not handle the case where the session is not active. This could happen if there is an error in a peer callback, which would cause the session to be in a partial rollback state.
     - **Solution**: Add a check to ensure that the session is active before adding the segment host mapping. If the session is not active, log the error and return.

4. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**

   - In the `_delete_segments_for_network` function, it calls the `delete_segment` method on the segments plugin for each segment that is associated with the network being deleted. However, it does not handle the case where the `delete_segment` method fails. This could happen if the segment is still in use by other resources.
     - **Solution**: Add a check to ensure that the `delete_segment` method succeeds. If the method fails, log the error and continue deleting the remaining segments.
