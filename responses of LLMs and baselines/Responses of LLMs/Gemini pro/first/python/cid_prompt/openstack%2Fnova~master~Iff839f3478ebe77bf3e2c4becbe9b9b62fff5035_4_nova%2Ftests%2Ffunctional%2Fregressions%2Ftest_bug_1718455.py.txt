CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison) in line 107:
The code compares the expected status of the migration with the status retrieved from the migrations API. However, the comparison is performed on the lowercase versions of the strings, which may lead to incorrect results if the case of the strings is significant.

Solution:
In line 107, replace the comparison with:
```
if (migration['instance_uuid'] == server['id'] and
        migration['status'] == expected_status):
```
