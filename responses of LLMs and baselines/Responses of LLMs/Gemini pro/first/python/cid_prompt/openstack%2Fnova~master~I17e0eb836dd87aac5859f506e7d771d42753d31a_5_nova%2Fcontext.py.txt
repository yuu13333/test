The following security defects are detected in the code:

1. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
   - Line 145: The `_set_read_deleted` method does not properly handle invalid values for `read_deleted`. It should raise a `ValueError` if the value is not one of 'no', 'yes', or 'only'.

   - Line 155: The `read_deleted` property does not have a setter. It only has a getter and a deleter. This can lead to the property not being set correctly when the value is assigned.

2. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
   - Line 235: When updating the context from the environment, the `project_id` attribute is set to the `tenant` attribute. However, the `tenant` attribute is not validated or sanitized before it is assigned to the `project_id` attribute. This can lead to an attacker being able to set the `project_id` attribute to an arbitrary value.

3. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
   - Line 280: If an exception is raised from `policy.authorize`, it will re-raise the exception if the `fatal` argument is True. However, if the `fatal` argument is False, it will return False, which is not a proper way to handle the exception.

4. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
   - Line 280: If an exception is raised from `policy.authorize`, it will re-raise the exception if the `fatal` argument is True. However, if the `fatal` argument is False, it will return False, which is not a proper way to handle the exception.

5. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
   - Line 187: The `timestamp` attribute is converted to a string using `utils.strtime`. However, `utils.strtime` is not a standard library function and may not be available in all environments. It is better to use the standard library `datetime` module to convert the timestamp to a string.

To fix these security defects, you should make the following changes:

- Line 145: Add a check to ensure that the `read_deleted` value is one of 'no', 'yes', or 'only' before setting the attribute.
- Line 155: Add a setter to the `read_deleted` property that validates the value before setting it.
- Line 235: Validate and sanitize the `tenant` attribute before assigning it to the `project_id` attribute.
- Line 280: Properly handle the exception raised from `policy.authorize`. Log the exception or return a meaningful error message.
- Line 187: Use the standard library `datetime` module to convert the timestamp to a string.
