1.CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
   - At line 184, the code does not validate the permissions of the user to access the console based on the protocol. This could lead to an attacker being able to access a remote console without proper authorization.

   Solution:
   ```python
   # Check if the user has permission to access the console for the given protocol
   if not context.can(rc_policies.BASE_POLICY_NAME, target={'protocol': protocol}):
       raise webob.exc.HTTPForbidden()
   ```

2.CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
   - At line 183, the code attempts to access the instance metadata dictionary to store the password for the console without checking if the metadata dictionary is not altered. An attacker can leverage this to gain persist access to the instance.

   Solution:
   ```python
   if instance.metadata is None:
        instance.metadata = {}
   ```
