1. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)** (Line 493)
   The `strip_prefix` function removes both leading `/dev/` and `xvd` or `sd` or `vd` or `hd` from a given device name. However, it doesn't handle the case where the input device name contains special characters or non-standard prefixes. An attacker could provide a specially crafted device name that would bypass the prefix stripping process and potentially lead to vulnerabilities.

   **Solution:**
   Enhance the `strip_prefix` function to handle a wider range of input device names, including those with special characters or non-standard prefixes. Thoroughly test the function to ensure that it correctly strips the prefix from various types of input.

2. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)** (Line 581)
   The `volume_in_mapping` function checks if a given mount device is present in a block device mapping by comparing the stripped device names. However, it doesn't consider the possibility of the mount device having a leading `/dev/` prefix while the device names in the mapping do not. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and potential security issues.

   **Solution:**
   Modify the `volume_in_mapping` function to consistently strip leading `/dev/` prefixes from both the mount device and the device names in the mapping before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is accurate and reflects the actual device names.

3. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)** (Line 591)
   The `volume_in_mapping` function checks if a mount device is in a block device mapping by comparing stripped device names. However, it doesn't handle the case where both the mount device and the device names in the mapping are empty strings. This can lead to incorrect results and potential security issues.

   **Solution:**
   Update the `volume_in_mapping` function to explicitly handle the case where the mount device or any of the device names in the mapping are empty strings. It should return `False` in such cases to avoid incorrect comparisons and potential vulnerabilities.
