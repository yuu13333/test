1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

   **Line 123**: The query `query = query.filter(l3.FloatingIP.router_id.in_(router_ids))` is vulnerable to improper access control because it does not check if the user has the necessary permissions to access the `router_ids`. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive information about the routers, such as their IP addresses and ports.
 

2. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**

   **Line 109**: The code does not properly neutralize the user-supplied input before using it in the `socket` field. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the database.

3. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

   The code does not follow the PEP 8 coding standards. For example, the line `result = super(PortForwarding, cls).modify_fields_to_db(fields)` is too long and should be split into multiple lines.

**Solutions**:

1. To fix the CWE-284 vulnerability, the code should check if the user has the necessary permissions to access the `router_ids` before executing the query. This can be done by adding a `check_access()` method to the `PortForwarding` class and calling it before executing the query.

2. To fix the CWE-707 vulnerability, the code should properly neutralize the user-supplied input before using it in the `socket` field. This can be done by using a regular expression to validate the input and by escaping any special characters.

3. To fix the CWE-710 vulnerability, the code should be reformatted to follow the PEP 8 coding standards. This can be done by using a code formatter such as `autopep8`.
