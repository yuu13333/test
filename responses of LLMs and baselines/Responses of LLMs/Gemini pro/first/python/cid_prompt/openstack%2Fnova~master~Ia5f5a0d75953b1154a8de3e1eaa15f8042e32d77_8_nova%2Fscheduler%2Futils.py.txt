- CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
Line 351: `if not source_node_allocations:`
   The code doesn't check whether `source_node_allocations` is `None` before using it, which could lead to an `AttributeError`.

- CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
Line 351: `if not source_node_allocations:`
   The code should check if `source_node_allocations` is empty rather than `None` to avoid using an empty dictionary when getting allocations for the destination node.


- CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
Line 475: `filter_properties['instance_type'] = instance_type`
   The code should clone the instance_type object before assigning it to the filter_properties dictionary to avoid potential issues if the object is modified later.

- CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)
Line 518: `if (max_attempts == 1 or len(force_hosts) == 1
                                           or len(force_nodes) == 1):`
   The code should use `all()` instead of `or` to correctly check if all conditions are met.

- CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)
Line 367: `source_node_allocations = (
    reportclient.get_allocations_for_consumer_by_provider(
        source_node.uuid, instance.uuid))`
   The code should use a more pythonic way to wrap a long line, such as using parentheses or the `\` character.
