CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
- Line 71-73: The self.user and self.group variables are set to the current effective user and group IDs, respectively, without verifying that the current user has the necessary privileges to do so. An attacker who is able to elevate their privileges on the system could exploit this to gain access to resources that should be restricted to the metadata proxy user.

CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)
- Line 113-114: The code attempts to create a config file for haproxy in a directory that may not exist. If the directory does not exist, it is created with the same permissions as the parent directory. This could allow an attacker to create a config file with world-readable permissions, allowing them to read the sensitive information in the config file.

CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
- Line 141-147: The code attempts to delete the config file created for haproxy when the metadata proxy is terminated. However, it does not handle the case where the config file does not exist. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior if the file does not exist.

CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
- Line 113-114: The code attempts to create a config file for haproxy in a directory that may not exist. If the directory does not exist, it is created with the same permissions as the parent directory. This could allow an attacker to create a config file with world-readable permissions, allowing them to read the sensitive information in the config file.

CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)
- Line 109-110: The code includes a comment that states that a UUID must be included in the command line so that it can be tracked by process_monitor. However, the code does not actually include a UUID in the command line. This could lead to problems if the metadata proxy is monitored by process_monitor.
