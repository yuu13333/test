The following security defect is detected in the code:

1. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): Line 162:
   ```python
   if port_id is None:
        return
   ```
   There is a comparison against `None` without considering the case of an empty string. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if an empty string is a valid value for `port_id` and treated differently from `None`.

   **Solution**:
   Modify the code to compare against both `None` and an empty string.

   ```python
   if port_id is None or port_id == '':
        return
   ```
