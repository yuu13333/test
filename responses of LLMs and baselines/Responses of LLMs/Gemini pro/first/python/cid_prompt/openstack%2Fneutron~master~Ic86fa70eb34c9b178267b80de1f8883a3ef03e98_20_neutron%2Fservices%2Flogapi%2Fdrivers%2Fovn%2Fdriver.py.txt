CWE-707: Improper Neutralization

- Line 301: `self._update_log_objs(context, [lo for lo in log_objs if lo.id != log_obj.id])`
   - This code removes a log object from the list of log objects and then updates the remaining log objects. However, it does not check if the log object being removed is the only log object associated with a particular ACL. If it is the only log object, the ACL will still be in use, even though there are no log objects associated with it. This can lead to orphaned ACLs that can be exploited by an attacker.

To mitigate this issue, the code should check if the log object being removed is the only log object associated with a particular ACL. If it is, the ACL should be deleted before the log object is removed from the list.
