   In the code `external_vm.block_until_no_ping(old_gw_ip)`, the `block_until_no_ping` method is used to check if the external VM can no longer ping a specific IP address (in this case, `old_gw_ip`). If the ping succeeds (`old_gw_ip` is reachable), the method will block indefinitely. However, the expected behavior is to check if the external VM can no longer ping the `old_gw_ip`, so the condition should be inverted to `external_vm.block_until_ping(old_gw_ip)` to detect when the IP is not reachable.

   In the code `external_vm.block_until_ping(fip['floating_ip_address'])`, the `block_until_ping` method is used to check if the external VM can ping a specific IP address (in this case, `fip['floating_ip_address']`). If the ping succeeds (`fip['floating_ip_address']` is reachable), the method will block indefinitely. However, the expected behavior is to check if the external VM can ping the `fip['floating_ip_address']`, so the condition should be inverted to `external_vm.block_until_no_ping(fip['floating_ip_address'])` to detect when the IP is not reachable.

   In the code `self._test_gateway_ip_changed()`, the method call `self._test_gateway_ip_changed()` incorrectly compares the returned value to `None`. This will always evaluate to `True` and will result in the function always being executed, regardless of the actual outcome of the `_test_gateway_ip_changed()` method. To fix this, the comparison should be removed entirely, as the method is intended to be executed regardless of the outcome of `_test_gateway_ip_changed()`.
