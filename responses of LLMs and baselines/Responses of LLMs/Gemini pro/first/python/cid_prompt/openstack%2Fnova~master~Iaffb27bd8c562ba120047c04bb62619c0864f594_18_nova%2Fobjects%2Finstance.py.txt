CWE-284: Improper Access Control
The code does not properly validate the identity of the user before performing actions that could potentially lead to unauthorized access to or modification of sensitive data or functions. Specifically, the instance deletion method is not currently protected by any form of authentication or authorization, and any user can delete any instance by simply calling the method without providing any credentials or permissions.

CWE-435: Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities
The code has a dependency on multiple components or services that interact with each other in a way that could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Specifically, the code assumes that the instance deletion method will be called by an authorized user, but it does not have any checks in place to verify that the caller is actually authorized to perform the action. This could lead to an attacker exploiting this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to or modification of sensitive data or functions.

CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through Its Lifetime
The code does not properly manage the lifecycle of resources that are allocated or acquired during the execution of the instance deletion method. Specifically, the code does not close or release any database connections or other resources that are acquired during the method execution, which could lead to resource exhaustion or other unexpected behavior.

CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation
The code performs an incorrect calculation or comparison that could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Specifically, the code does not properly compare the value of the 'vm_state' attribute to the expected 'SOFT_DELETED' value before performing the soft delete operation. This could lead to instances being deleted even if they are not in the 'SOFT_DELETED' state, resulting in data loss or other unexpected behavior.

CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
The code does not properly handle or validate input or state information that could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Specifically, the code does not check if the 'instance' object provided to the delete method is valid or if it actually exists in the database. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior if an invalid or non-existent instance is passed to the method.

CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
The code does not implement or enforce a security mechanism or policy that is intended to prevent or mitigate security vulnerabilities. Specifically, the code does not have any access control or authorization checks in place to ensure that only authorized users can call the instance deletion method. This could lead to an attacker exploiting this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to or modification of sensitive data or functions.

CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison
The code performs an incorrect comparison or equality check that could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Specifically, the code does not properly compare the value of the 'hidden' attribute to 'false' before performing the soft delete operation. This could lead to hidden instances being deleted, which could result in data loss or other unexpected behavior.
