Line 782: There is a potential for an SQL injection attack, as the filters dictionary is built with user-supplied input without proper sanitization.
Line 783: The loop that iterates over the `valid_groups` set is prone to a logical error. If the `port_sg` set is empty, the loop will still run, resulting in an incorrect comparison.
Line 813: The `_check_update_has_security_groups` method has a similar issue to `_check_update_deletes_security_groups`. If the `ext_sg.SECURITYGROUPS` key is present in the `port['port']` dictionary, but its value is not set, the method will return `True` incorrectly.
