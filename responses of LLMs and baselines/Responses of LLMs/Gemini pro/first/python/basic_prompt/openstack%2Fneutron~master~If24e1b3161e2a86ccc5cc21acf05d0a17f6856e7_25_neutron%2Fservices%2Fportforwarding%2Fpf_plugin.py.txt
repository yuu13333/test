There are two security defects in the provided code. They are described as follows:

**1. Improper Input Validation**

There is improper input validation in the `_get_subnet_check_valid_internal_ip` method that may lead to security risks.

- Defect Location: Line 85
- Description:

The `_get_subnet_check_valid_internal_ip` method takes several fixed IPs as input and returns the subnet ID if the passed IP belongs to that subnet. The method does not perform any validation on the passed IPs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted IP address causing a SQL injection attack.

- Solution:

To fix this issue, perform validation on the passed IPs in the `_get_subnet_check_valid_internal_ip` method.

**2. Improper Input Validation**

There is improper input validation in the `_validate_filter_for_port_forwarding` method that may lead to security risks.

- Defect Location: Line 273
- Description:

The `_validate_filter_for_port_forwarding` method takes a dictionary as input and validates if the keys in the dictionary are supported. If a key is not supported, the method raises a `PortForwardingNotSupportFilterField` exception. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted dictionary containing unsupported keys causing a denial of service attack.

- Solution:

To fix this issue, perform validation on the keys in the input dictionary in the `_validate_filter_for_port_forwarding` method.
