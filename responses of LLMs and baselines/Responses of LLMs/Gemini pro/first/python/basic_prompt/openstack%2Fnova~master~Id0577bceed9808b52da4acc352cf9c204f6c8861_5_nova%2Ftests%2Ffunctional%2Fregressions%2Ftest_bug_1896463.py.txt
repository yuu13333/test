153 # Unfortunately we cannot reproduce the above situation without sleeps.
154 # We need that the evac starts first then the periodic starts, but not
155 # finishes, then evac finishes, then periodic finishes. If I trigger
156 # and run the whole periodic in a wrapper of drop_migration_context
157 # then I could not reproduce the situation described at #4). In general

**Security Defect:** Sleeps are used in the test method to induce a race condition between the `Instance.drop_migration_context` method and the `MigrationList.get_in_progress_and_error` method. This is a form of a timing attack, where the attacker relies on the timing of events to exploit a vulnerability.

**Solution:** Unit tests should not rely on timing to ensure the expected behavior. The sleeps should be removed, and the test should use other mechanisms, such as mocks or condition variables, to ensure that the methods are called in the expected order.
