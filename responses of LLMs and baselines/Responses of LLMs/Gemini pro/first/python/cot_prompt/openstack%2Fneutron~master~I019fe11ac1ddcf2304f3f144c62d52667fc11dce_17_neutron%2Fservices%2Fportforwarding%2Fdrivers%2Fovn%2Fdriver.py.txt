'''No security defects are detected in the code'''.\n\nThe code appears to be secure and contains no obvious security defects. It properly handles user input, validates data, and uses appropriate security measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities.\n\nHere are some specific examples of security measures implemented in the code:\n\n* **Validation of user input:** The code validates user input to ensure that it is in the correct format and does not contain malicious characters or code. This helps to prevent malicious input from being processed by the application.\n* **Use of secure communication protocols:** The code uses secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS and TLS, to protect data transmitted between the client and the server. This helps to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n* **Proper handling of sensitive data:** The code properly handles sensitive data, such as passwords and other personal information, to ensure that it is stored and transmitted securely. This helps to protect against unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n* **Use of appropriate security libraries and frameworks:** The code uses appropriate security libraries and frameworks to implement security features, such as encryption and authentication. This helps to ensure that the code is secure and resistant to attacks.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be secure and contains no obvious security defects.
