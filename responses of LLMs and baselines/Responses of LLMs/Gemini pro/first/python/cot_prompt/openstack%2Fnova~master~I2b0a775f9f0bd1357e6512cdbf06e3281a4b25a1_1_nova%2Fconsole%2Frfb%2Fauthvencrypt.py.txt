No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code uses the `ssl.wrap_socket()` function to establish a TLS connection with a remote server. It correctly sets the `cert_reqs` parameter to `ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`, which means that the server is required to present a certificate. It also sets the `ca_certs` parameter to the path of the certificate authority (CA) certificates, which are used to verify the server's certificate.\n\nThe code also sets the `ssl_version` parameter to `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2`, which is a secure TLS version. By default, `ssl.wrap_socket()` uses `PROTOCOL_SSLv23`, which allows the use of insecure SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security defects.
