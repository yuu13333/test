**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. It properly handles file permissions and uses the `utils.execute()` function with `run_as_root=True` to ensure that the commands are executed with the necessary privileges. Additionally, it uses `synchronized()` decorators to prevent concurrent access to critical sections of the code, ensuring that operations are performed in a controlled manner.
