**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security defects. It properly handles user input, prevents cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and does not expose sensitive information.\n\nHere are some specific examples of security measures that are implemented in the code:\n\n* **Input validation:** The code uses the `util.extract_json()` function to extract JSON data from the request body. This function validates the JSON data against a schema to ensure that it is in the correct format and contains the expected fields.\n* **XSS prevention:** The code does not use any user-provided input directly in HTML output. This helps to prevent XSS attacks, where attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.\n* **Sensitive information protection:** The code does not expose any sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, in the response body.\n\nOverall, the code follows good security practices and appears to be secure.
