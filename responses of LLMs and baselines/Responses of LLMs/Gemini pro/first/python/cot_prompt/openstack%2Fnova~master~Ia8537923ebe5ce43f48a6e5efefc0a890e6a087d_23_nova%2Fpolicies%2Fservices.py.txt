**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe code adds new default roles in os-services API policies, which improves the security level and manageability. The new policies are more rich in terms of handling access at system and project level token with read, write roles.\n\nThe old policies are marked as deprecated and will be silently ignored in nova 23.0.0 (OpenStack W) release. This means that existing deployments will keep working until the deprecated rules are removed.\n\nThe commit message also includes a warning that can be seen by the operator to migrate the old policies to the new ones.\n\nOverall, the code changes are secure and improve the security of the os-services API.
