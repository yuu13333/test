**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe code is a Python script that generates configuration files for the Keepalived VRRP service. It does not contain any security-sensitive operations or data, and it is not executed with elevated privileges. The generated configuration files are also not security-sensitive, as they only contain configuration options for the Keepalived service. Therefore, there are no security defects detected in the code.
