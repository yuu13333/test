No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code is related to initializing global data in a WSGI application. It uses a decorator `@run_once_per_interpreter` to ensure that the function is only run once per python interpreter instance. This is to prevent re-initialization of global data, which can cause problems.\n\nThe decorator checks if the function has already been run by checking the value of `run_once_per_interpreter.ran`. If it has been run, the decorator exits with a message. If it has not been run, the decorator sets `run_once_per_interpreter.ran` to True and calls the function.\n\nThis code does not handle any user input or perform any security-sensitive operations. Therefore, there are no security defects in the code.
