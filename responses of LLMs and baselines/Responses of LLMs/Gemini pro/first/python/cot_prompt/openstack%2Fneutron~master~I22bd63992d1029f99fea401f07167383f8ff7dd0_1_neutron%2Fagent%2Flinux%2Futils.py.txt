**Security Defect**: Potential Command Injection (Line 233)\n\n**Description**:\nIn the `kill_process` function, the `execute` function is used to send a kill signal to a process. The `execute` function takes a list of strings as its first argument, and the first string in the list is the command to be executed. In this case, the command is `[\'kill\', \'-%d\' % signal, pid]`, where `signal` is the signal to be sent and `pid` is the process ID of the process to be killed.\n\nHowever, the `execute` function does not properly sanitize the `signal` and `pid` arguments before using them to construct the command string. This means that an attacker could potentially provide a specially crafted value for `signal` or `pid` that would cause the `execute` function to execute an arbitrary command instead of sending the intended kill signal.\n\n**Solution**:\nTo fix this security defect, the `execute` function should be modified to properly sanitize the `signal` and `pid` arguments before using them to construct the command string. This can be done using the `shlex.quote` function, which escapes any special characters in the given string to prevent them from being interpreted as part of the command.\n\nThe following code shows how to use the `shlex.quote` function to sanitize the `signal` and `pid` arguments:\n\n```python\ndef kill_process(pid, signal, run_as_root=False):\n    """Kill the process with the given pid using the given signal."""\n    try:\n        execute([\'kill\', \'-%s\' % shlex.quote(signal), shlex.quote(pid)],\n                run_as_root=run_as_root)\n    except ProcessExecutionError as ex:\n        if process_is_running(pid):\n            raise\n```\n\n**No other security defects are detected in the code.**
