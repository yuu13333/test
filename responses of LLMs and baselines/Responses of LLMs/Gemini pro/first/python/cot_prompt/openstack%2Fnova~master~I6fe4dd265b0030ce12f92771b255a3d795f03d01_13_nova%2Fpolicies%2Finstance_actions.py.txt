No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code is related to the implementation of a new API in Nova that exposes instance action event details. It adds a new microversion to the existing os-instance-actions API and introduces a new policy rule to control access to the details.\n\nThe code follows best practices for API design and security. It uses the oslo_policy library to define and enforce access control policies. The new policy rule, BASE_POLICY_NAME % 'events:details', is defined with a default check_str of base.SYSTEM_READER, which means that only users with the system_reader_api role will be able to access the event fault details.\n\nThe code also includes a deprecation warning for the old policy rule, DEPRECATED_INSTANCE_ACTION_POLICY, which is scheduled to be removed in Nova 23.0.0. This is a good practice to ensure that users are aware of upcoming changes and have time to adjust their code accordingly.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be secure and follows good security practices.
