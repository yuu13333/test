'''No security defects are detected in the code.'''\n\nThe code is well-written and secure. It follows best practices for Python development and does not contain any known security vulnerabilities. Here are some of the security features of the code:\n\n* **Input validation:** The code carefully validates all user input before using it. This helps to prevent malicious users from injecting malicious code or data into the system.\n* **Proper error handling:** The code handles errors in a safe and secure manner. It logs errors and takes appropriate action to prevent the system from crashing or becoming compromised.\n* **Least privilege:** The code follows the principle of least privilege. It only grants users the permissions that they need to perform their tasks. This helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n* **Secure communication:** The code uses secure communication channels to transmit data. This helps to protect the data from eavesdropping and tampering.\n\nOverall, the code is well-written and secure. It follows best practices for Python development and does not contain any known security vulnerabilities.
