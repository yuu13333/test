**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe code appears to be secure. It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities or weaknesses. However, it's important to note that security is a complex issue and it is always possible for vulnerabilities to be discovered in even the most secure code. Therefore, it is important to stay up-to-date on the latest security advisories and patches, and to use secure coding practices whenever possible.\n\nHere are some general security tips that can help you write more secure code:\n\n* Use strong and unique passwords.\n* Avoid hardcoding credentials in your code.\n* Use encryption to protect sensitive data.\n* Validate input from users and other sources.\n* Handle errors and exceptions gracefully.\n* Keep your software up-to-date with the latest security patches.\n* Regularly review your code for security vulnerabilities.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help reduce the risk of security defects in your code.
