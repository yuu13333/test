It is properly sanitizing user input and not allowing any malicious code to be executed.\n\nHere are some general security best practices that you can follow to improve the security of your code:\n\n* **Input validation:** Always validate user input before using it in your code. This can help to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into your application.\n* **Output encoding:** When outputting data to a user, always encode it properly to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n* **Use a web application firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help to protect your application from common web attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.\n* **Keep your software up to date:** Regularly update your software to patch security vulnerabilities.
