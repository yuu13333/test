```python\n122             return {ovn_const.ACL_ACTION_ALLOW_RELATED,\n123                     ovn_const.ACL_ACTION_ALLOW}\n```\n\nThis code has a potential security issue. The `ovn_const.ACL_ACTION_ALLOW_RELATED` action allows packets to bypass security group rules and reach the destination. This can be a security risk if the ACL is misconfigured or exploited.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\n122             return {ovn_const.ACL_ACTION_ALLOW}\n```\n\nThis code removes the `ovn_const.ACL_ACTION_ALLOW_RELATED` action, which prevents packets from bypassing security group rules.\n\n\n```python\n132     def _remove_acls_log(self, pgs, ovn_txn, log_name=None):\n133         acl_changes, acl_visits = 0, 0\n```\n\nThis code has a potential security issue. The `_remove_acls_log` function removes all ACLs associated with a given log name. This can be a security risk if the log name is misconfigured or exploited, as it can allow unauthorized access to resources.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\n132     def _remove_acls_log(self, pgs, ovn_txn, log_name=None):\n133         acl_changes, acl_visits = 0, 0\n134         for pg in pgs:\n135             for acl_uuid in pg["acls"]:\n136                 acl_visits += 1\n137                 # skip acls used by a different network log\n138                 if log_name:\n139                     acl = self.ovn_nb.lookup("ACL", acl_uuid)\n140                     if acl.name and acl.name[0] != log_name:\n141                         continue\n142                 # Only remove ACLs that are associated with the log name\n143                 if acl.name and acl.name[0] == log_name:\n144                     ovn_txn.add(self.ovn_nb.db_set(\n145                         "ACL", acl_uuid,\n146                         ("log", False),\n147                         ("meter", []),\n148                         ("name", []),\n149                         ("severity", [])\n150                     ))\n151                     acl_changes += 1\n```\n\nThis code checks the ACL name before removing it to ensure that only ACLs associated with the specified log name are removed.\n\n\n```python\n155     def _set_acls_log(self, pgs, ovn_txn, actions_enabled, log_name):\n156         acl_changes, acl_visits = 0, 0\n```\n\nThis code has a potential security issue.
