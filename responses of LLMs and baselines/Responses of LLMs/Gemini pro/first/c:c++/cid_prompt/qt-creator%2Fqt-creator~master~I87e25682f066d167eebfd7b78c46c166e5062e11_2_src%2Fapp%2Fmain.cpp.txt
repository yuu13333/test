2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):**
   - There is no evidence of this defect.


3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):**
   - Line 204: The `copyRecursively` function does not properly handle the case where the source file is a directory and the target directory does not exist. This could lead to data loss if the target directory is not created before calling `copyRecursively`.
   - **Solution**: The function should create the target directory if it does not exist before copying the files.


4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**
   - There is no evidence of this defect.


5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):**
   - Line 391: The loop that parses the command-line arguments does not properly handle the case where the next argument is not present. This could lead to a crash if the argument is required.
   - **Solution**: The loop should check for the presence of the next argument before accessing it.


6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):**
   - There is no evidence of this defect.


7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):**
   - There is no evidence of this defect.


8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):**
   - Line 367: The function `QFontDatabase::addApplicationFont` does not properly handle the case where the file does not exist. This could lead to a crash if the file is not present.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):**
   - There is no evidence of this defect.


10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):**
