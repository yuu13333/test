1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

   Line 211: There is a potential improper access control issue in the code. The function `macQueryInternal` releases the `CFDictionaryRef` `dict` without checking if it is `NULL`. This could lead to a crash if `dict` is `NULL`.
   To fix this issue, add a check to ensure that `dict` is not `NULL` before releasing it. For example:

   ```C++
   if (dict) {
       CFRelease(dict);
   }
   ```

2. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

   Line 240: The code uses the function `CFURLCreateWithString` to create a `CFURLRef` from a `CFStringRef`. However, it does not check the return value of `CFURLCreateWithString` to ensure that the `CFURLRef` was created successfully. This could lead to a crash if `CFURLCreateWithString` fails.

   To fix this issue, add a check to ensure that the `CFURLRef` was created successfully. For example:

   ```C++
   if (!targetURL) {
       qWarning("Failed to create target URL");
       return result;
   }
   ```
