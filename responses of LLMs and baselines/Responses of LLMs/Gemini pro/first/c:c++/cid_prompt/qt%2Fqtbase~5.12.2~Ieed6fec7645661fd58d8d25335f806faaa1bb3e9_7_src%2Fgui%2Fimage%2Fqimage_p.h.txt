- CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation) at line 134:
   The code attempts to calculate `total_size` by multiplying `height` and `bytes_per_line` without checking for integer overflow. This can lead to incorrect results or undefined behavior, especially for large images. To fix this, overflow checking should be performed before performing the multiplication.

- CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards) at line 139:
   The code includes a conditional block that appears to be incomplete or unnecessary, as it checks for a condition that is no longer relevant in Qt version 6.0 and above. This conditional block should be removed or updated to correctly handle the current Qt version.
