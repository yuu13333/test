**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):**
•	Line 989: The code seems to have a potential issue regarding resource management. It blindly selects the first row of the search results without considering the possibility that there might not be any valid results. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the list is empty. It's generally good practice to check for the existence or validity of results before performing operations on them.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**
•	Line 925: The code checks if the row index is valid before accessing it, but the condition it uses (`row < 0 || row >= m_locatorModel->rowCount()`) is incorrect. It should be `row < 0 || row >= m_locatorModel->rowCount(QModelIndex())` to correctly compare the row index with the number of rows in the model.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):**
•	Line 912: The code schedules accepting an entry when the update is requested but doesn't handle the case where the update is not requested. This could lead to unpredictable behavior or errors if the update is never completed or if accepting the entry is attempted before the update is finished. It's generally advisable to have a consistent approach to handling these scenarios.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):**
•	Line 925: The code checks if the row index is valid before accessing it, but the condition it uses (`row < 0 || row >= m_locatorModel->rowCount()`) is incorrect. It should be `row < 0 || row >= m_locatorModel->rowCount(QModelIndex())` to correctly compare the row index with the number of rows in the model.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):**
•	Line 838: The code shows the progress indicator when visible, but it doesn't handle the case where the progress indicator is not visible. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the progress indicator is not correctly hidden or updated. It's generally good practice to handle all possible states of a component or feature.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):**
•	Line 964: The code uses `m_fileLineEdit->text()` to retrieve the current text, which is not very descriptive and doesn't adhere to the Qt naming conventions. It would be better to use `currentText()` instead, which is a method provided by the `LocatorWidget` class to retrieve the current text.
