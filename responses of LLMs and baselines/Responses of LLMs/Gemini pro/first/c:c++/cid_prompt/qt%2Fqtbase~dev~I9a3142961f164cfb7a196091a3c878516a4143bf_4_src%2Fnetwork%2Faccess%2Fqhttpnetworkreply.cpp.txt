CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
Line 557 of the code compares the string "HTTP/" with a character other than '/'. This should be fixed to correctly check for a '/', not a letter or number.

CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
Line 501 of the code does not handle the case where the socket returns an error when reading status. This should be handled to ensure that the error is properly propagated to the caller.

CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
Line 544: The comment states that the minimum length is 11, however the code checks for length 5 and 11.

Line 700: The comment states that the function can only be used for non-chunked, non-compressed with known content length, however the code does not check for these conditions.
