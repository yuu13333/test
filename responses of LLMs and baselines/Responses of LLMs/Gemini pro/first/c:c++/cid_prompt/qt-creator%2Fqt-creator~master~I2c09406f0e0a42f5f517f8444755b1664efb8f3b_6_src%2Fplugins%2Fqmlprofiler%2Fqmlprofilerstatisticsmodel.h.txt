1. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
   - Line 104: The `getTypes()` method returns a reference to the `m_types` member variable, which is a const reference.
     This means that any code that calls this method can modify the contents of the `m_types` variable, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
   - Solution: Change the return type of the `getTypes()` method to `const QVector<QmlEventType>&` to prevent any modification of the `m_types` variable.

2. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
   - Line 56: The `QmlEventStats::total` member variable is initialized to 0, which could lead to incorrect calculations if the `QmlEventStats` object is used without being properly initialized.
   - Solution: Initialize the `QmlEventStats::total` member variable to the sum of the durations in the `durations` vector.

3. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
   - Line 67: The code assumes that `size` will never be greater than the maximum value of `qint64`, which could lead to undefined behavior if the `durations` vector contains more than `LLONG_MAX` elements.
   - Solution: Use `size_t` or `std::numeric_limits<size_t>::max()` to ensure that the comparison is performed correctly.

4. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
   - Line 14: The comment uses `**` for bold text instead of the standard `///` for comments in C++.
   - Solution: Use `///` to comment out the code.
