CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
Line 200: The xcb image creation code uses a hard-coded value of XCB_IMAGE_ORDER_MSB_FIRST for both the image order and the byte order. This is an incorrect assumption, as the byte order of the image data may not match the byte order of the server. This could lead to incorrect rendering of the image.

Recommendation:
Use the xcb_get_setup() function to obtain the byte order of the server and use that value to set the byte order of the xcb image. This will ensure that the image data is interpreted correctly by the server.

```c++
xcb_setup_t *setup = xcb_get_setup(xcb_connection());
uint8_t byte_order = setup->image_byte_order;
xcb_image_t *m_xcb_image = xcb_image_create(size.width(), size.height(),
                                      XCB_IMAGE_FORMAT_Z_PIXMAP,
                                      fmt->scanline_pad,
                                      fmt->depth, fmt->bits_per_pixel, 0,
                                      byte_order == XCB_IMAGE_ORDER_MSB_FIRST ? XCB_IMAGE_ORDER_MSB_FIRST : XCB_IMAGE_ORDER_LSB_FIRST,
                                      XCB_IMAGE_ORDER_MSB_FIRST,
                                      0, ~0, 0);
```

CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
Line 214: The comparison of `m_segmentSize` to `segmentSize` in the condition `if (m_segmentSize > 0 && (m_segmentSize < segmentSize || m_segmentSize >= segmentSize * 4))` is incorrect. It checks if the current segment size is greater than 0 and if it is either less than the new segment size or four times greater than the new segment size. This condition is too restrictive and will never be true if the new segment size is less than four times the current segment size.

Recommendation:
Change the condition to `if (m_segmentSize > 0 && (m_segmentSize < segmentSize || m_segmentSize > segmentSize * 4))` to correctly check if the current segment size is greater than 0 and if it is either less than or greater than four times the new segment size.

```c++
if (m_segmentSize > 0 && (m_segmentSize < segmentSize || m_segmentSize > segmentSize * 4)) {
    doDestroyShm(true);
    m_shm_info.shmaddr = 0;
}
