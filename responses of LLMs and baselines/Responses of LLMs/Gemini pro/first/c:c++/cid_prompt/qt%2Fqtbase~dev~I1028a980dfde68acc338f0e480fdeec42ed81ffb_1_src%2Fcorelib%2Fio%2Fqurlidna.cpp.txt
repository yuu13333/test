**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**:
- Line 101: This code does not properly handle invalid input, which could lead to a denial of service attack.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
- Line 115: This code does not properly release resources, which could lead to a resource leak.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**:
- Line 169: This vulnerability is possible because the code does not properly handle integer overflow. This could lead to an incorrect calculation, which could have a variety of negative consequences.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**:
- Line 147: This line does not properly handle invalid input, which could lead to a denial of service attack.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**:
- Line 209: This code does not properly handle invalid input, which could lead to a denial of service attack.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**:
- Line 403: This code does not properly handle invalid input, which could lead to a denial of service attack.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**:
- Line 170: This code does not properly handle exceptions, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
- Line 182: This code does not properly handle exceptions, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
- Line 287: This code does not properly handle exceptions, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**:
- Line 244: This code does not properly neutralize special characters, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Line 245: This code does not properly neutralize special characters, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Line 246: This code does not properly neutralize special characters, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
