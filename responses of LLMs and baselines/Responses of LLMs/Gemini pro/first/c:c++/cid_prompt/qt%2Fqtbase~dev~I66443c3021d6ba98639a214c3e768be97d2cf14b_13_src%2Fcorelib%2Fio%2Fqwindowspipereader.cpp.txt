1.CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
   - Line 451: The variable `lastError` is set without checking the return value of `PeekNamedPipe`, which may result in an incorrect error code.

2.CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
   - Line 509: The call to `checkPipeState` is not protected by a lock, which may allow another thread to modify the pipe state while it is being checked.

3.CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
   - Line 430: The variable `winEventActPosted` is set to `false` without acquiring the mutex, which may result in a race condition.

Solution:
1.CWE-682
   - Line 451: Add a check for the return value of `PeekNamedPipe` before setting `lastError`.
2.CWE-284
   - Line 509: Acquire the mutex before calling `checkPipeState`.
3.CWE-664
   - Line 430: Acquire the mutex before setting `winEventActPosted` to `false`.
