CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)

- Line 176-179, if the filter is named "rules", it is using a while loop to iterate over every instance of the filter instead of using a for loop with the keys of "rules". This can cause an infinite loop if the filter has a recursive element, and is a violation of CWE-435.
- Line 222-227, if the filter is named anything other than "rules" (case insensitive), it will not be loaded, and all rules will be ignored. This is a violation of CWE-435, as the filter is not properly checking for the correct name.
