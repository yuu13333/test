The following security defects are identified:

1. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization) in line 285:
   The `launch` function calls `system` to execute a command without properly escaping the arguments. This makes it vulnerable to command injection attacks.

   Solution:
   Use `QProcess::startDetached` instead of `system` and ensure that all arguments are properly escaped before being passed to the process.

2. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation) in line 118:
   The `checkExecutable` function uses `QStandardPaths::findExecutable` to check if a given executable exists on the system. However, this function doesn't take into account the possibility of multiple installations of the same executable in different locations. This can lead to incorrect results if the user has multiple versions of the same executable installed.

   Solution:
   Instead of using `QStandardPaths::findExecutable`, use a more robust method to check for the existence of an executable, such as searching the user's $PATH environment variable.

3. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions) in line 167:
   The `launch` function doesn't handle the case where `QProcess::startDetached` fails. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the process cannot be started.

   Solution:
   Add proper error handling to the `launch` function to handle the case where `QProcess::startDetached` fails.
