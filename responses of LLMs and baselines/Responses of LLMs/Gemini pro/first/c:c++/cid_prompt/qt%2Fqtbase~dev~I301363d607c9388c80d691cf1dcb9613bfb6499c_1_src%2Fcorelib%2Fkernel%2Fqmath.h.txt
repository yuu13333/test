1. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
   - Line 255: The calculation of `d` in `qFastSin` and `qFastCos` functions is potentially imprecise due to the use of integer division and rounding. This could lead to inaccurate results for certain input values.
     - Solution: Consider using more accurate floating-point calculations or a more robust algorithm for calculating the sine and cosine values.
2. CWE-697: (Incorrect Comparison):
   - Line 155: The comparison `if (val > scale)` in the `QHypotHelper` class assumes that `scale` is always greater than zero, but this may not be the case if the input values are zero or negative.
     - Solution: Add a check to ensure that `scale` is positive before performing the comparison.
3. CWE-703: (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
   - Line 350: The function `qNextPowerOfTwo` does not handle the case where the input value `v` is zero, which may result in undefined behavior.
     - Solution: Add a check to handle the case when `v` is zero and return an appropriate value (e.g., 1) to avoid potential undefined behavior.
