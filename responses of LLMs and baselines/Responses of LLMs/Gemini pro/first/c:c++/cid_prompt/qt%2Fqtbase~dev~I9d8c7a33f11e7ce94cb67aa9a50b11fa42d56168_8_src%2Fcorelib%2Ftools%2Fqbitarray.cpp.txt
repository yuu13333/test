1. CWE-697(Incorrect Comparison):
   - Line 249, there is a condition 'if (ba)'. Normally, the comparison should be 'if (!ba.isNull())'.

2. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
   - Line 818: The code doesn't handle the situation when 'in.readRawData()' returns 'blockSize', which is an exceptional condition. Ideally, it should have an 'else' clause to handle this case.
