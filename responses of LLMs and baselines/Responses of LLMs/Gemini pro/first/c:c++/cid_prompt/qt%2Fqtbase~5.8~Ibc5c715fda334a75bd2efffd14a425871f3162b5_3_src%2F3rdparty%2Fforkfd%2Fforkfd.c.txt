1.CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
- Line 830: When spawning a process with posix_spawnp or posix_spawn, the child process's PID is stored in the info structure. However, there is no check to ensure that the process is still running before storing the PID. If the process exits before the PID is stored, another thread may call forkfd with the same PID, leading to unexpected behavior.


2.CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)
- Lines 700-702: To prevent the child process from exiting before the parent process has finished storing the child's PID, the parent process blocks the child in a read(2) until it is finished. However, this can lead to a deadlock if the parent process is interrupted by a signal while reading from the pipe.


3.CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
- Lines 366-372: If the child process exits and is not found in the children's array or the BigArrays, the program assumes that the child belongs to a chained SIGCHLD handler and does not properly handle the child's exit. This could lead to child processes being lost and their resources not being cleaned up properly.


4.CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
- Lines 311-314: In the sigchld_handler function, the program attempts to calculate the number of un-waited-for children using waitid. However, it uses the si_pid field of the siginfo_t structure to determine the number of un-waited-for children, which is incorrect and may lead to inaccurate results.


5.CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)
- Lines 575-576: The program checks if the system has the PROCDESC feature enabled using pdfork. If not, it sets the system_has_forkfd flag to 0. However, this check is only performed on FreeBSD 9. On other platforms, the system_has_forkfd flag is set to a constant value without any checks, which may lead to incorrect behavior.


6.CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)
- Lines 669-670: The program attempts to create two pipes, death_pipe and sync_pipe, before forking a child process. If the creation of either pipe fails, the program proceeds to fork the child process, which may lead to unexpected behavior or resource leaks.


7.CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)
- Lines 674-678: The program attempts to use an eventfd to communicate with the child process. If the creation of the eventfd fails, the program falls back to using a pipe. However, the program does not check if the fallback to the pipe was successful, which may lead to errors or unexpected behavior.


8.CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
- Lines 686-687: The program forks a child process without checking if the fork was successful. If the fork fails, the program continues to execute, which may lead to unexpected behavior or resource leaks.


9.CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
- Lines 817-818: The program calls notifyAndFreeInfo to handle the case where the child process has already exited before the parent process has finished setting up. However, the program does not check if notifyAndFreeInfo was successful, which may lead to errors or unexpected behavior.


10.CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)
- There are several instances of variable names and identifiers not following consistent naming conventions throughout the code. For example, some variables use Hungarian notation (e.g. ffd_atomic_load), while others do not (e.g. nextArray).
