**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

This defect can occur when resources are not properly released when they are no longer needed. An attacker can exploit this defect by triggering the creation and destruction of the resource as often as possible, which can consume memory, processor time, or other resources. This attack is sometimes known as a resource exhaustion attack.

In this code, this defect arises due to the use of `new` to instantiate `QCalendar` objects. This means that the `QCalendar` object will not be automatically deleted when it is no longer needed, and the programmer is responsible for manually deleting it. If the programmer forgets to delete the `QCalendar` object, it will continue to exist in memory and consume resources until the program terminates.

To fix this defect, the programmer should use a smart pointer, such as `std::unique_ptr`, to manage the lifetime of the `QCalendar` object. This will ensure that the object is automatically deleted when it is no longer needed.

Here is an example of how to fix this defect by using a smart pointer:

```c++
std::unique_ptr<QCalendar> calendar(new QCalendar);
```

The smart pointer will automatically delete the `QCalendar` object when it goes out of scope.

Additionally, the code should be modified to use a `QGlobalStatic` object to ensure that each enum-available calendar has been instantiated. The `populate()` method should be called to ensure that all backends are registered with their primary names.

This is done because name-based lookups can always find all the calendars available via the enum.

```c++
void QCalendar::populate()
{
    if (populated)
        return;

    for (int i = 0; i <= int(QCalendar::System::Last); ++i)
        (void)QCalendar(QCalendar::System(i));
}
```

**Line Number:** 718-728

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

Improper adherence to coding standards can lead to security defects and other problems. For example, if a coding standard requires that all variables be declared at the beginning of a function, and a programmer accidentally declares a variable in the middle of a function, it could lead to a bug.

In this code, the coding standard violation is the use of the `QCalendar` object without first checking if it is valid. This could lead to a bug if the `QCalendar` object is not properly initialized.

To fix this defect, the programmer should check if the `QCalendar` object is valid before using it. This can be done by calling the `isValid()` method of the `QCalendar` object.

Here is an example of how to fix this defect:

```c++
if (calendar.isValid()) {
    // Use the QCalendar object
}
```

or

```c++
QCalendar calendar;
if (!calendar.isValid()) {
    // Handle the error
}
```

With these changes, the code is now free of the identified security defects and more closely adheres to coding standards.
