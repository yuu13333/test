**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**

Line 139-150:

`bool isTimedOut(const chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point &start,
                          int msecs = APP_START_TIMEOUT)
    {
        bool timedOut = false;
        auto end = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        if (chrono::duration_cast<chrono::milliseconds>(end-start).count() > msecs)
            timedOut = true;
        return timedOut;
    }`

Improvement: To avoid inaccuracies due to differing resolutions between different systems, consider using a relative system timer, such as `QElapsedTimer`, `QTime` or `QDateTime`.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

Line 156-165:

```
static void deleter(QProcess *p)
{
    qCDebug(androidRunWorkerLog) << "Killing process:" << p->objectName();
    p->terminate();
    if (!p->waitForFinished(1000)) {
        p->kill();
        p->waitForFinished();
    }
    // Might get deleted from its own signal handler.
    p->deleteLater();
}
```

Improvement: Add a separate `QObject` containing a `QProcess` and use `connect` to safely manage and clean up the process.

**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

Line 132:

```
        QStringList args = {selector};
```

Improvement: Properly sanitize the user input to prevent command injection attacks.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**

Line 399-401:

```
    void adbKill(qint64 pid)
    {
        if (!runAdb({"shell", "run-as", m_packageName, "kill", "-9", QString::number(pid)}))
            runAdb({"shell", "kill", "-9", QString::number(pid)});
    }
```

Improvement: Consider adding a timeout to the process killing, as it might not terminate immediately, preventing further operations.
