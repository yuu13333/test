1. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) in line 111
   - The socketFilePath function returns the path to the control socket without checking if the temporary directory exists. This could lead to a situation where the temporary directory is deleted or moved, causing the socket file to become inaccessible.
   - Solution: Add a check to ensure the temporary directory exists before returning the socket file path.

2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities) in line 307
   - The createRemoteProcess function constructs a SshRemoteProcess object and returns a pointer to it. However, the Process object is not properly managed and can be leaked if the pointer is not deleted.
   - Solution: Consider using a smart pointer or a unique_ptr to manage the lifetime of the Process object.

3. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure) in line 251
   - The errorString function returns the value of the d->errorString member without checking if it is empty. This could lead to a situation where an empty error string is returned even if an error has occurred.
   - Solution: Add a check to ensure the error string is not empty before returning it.

4. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization) in line 287
   - The connectionInfo function sets the value of the d->connInfo.peerAddress member without properly neutralizing the input. This could lead to a situation where a malicious user could provide an invalid IP address and cause the connection to fail.
   - Solution: Use a function like QHostAddress::setAddress to properly neutralize the input before setting the value of the member.

5. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison) in line 171
   - The socketWatcherTimer.disconnect() function is called without checking if the timer is still running. This could lead to a situation where the timer is already stopped and the call to disconnect() has no effect.
   - Solution: Add a check to ensure the timer is still running before calling disconnect().

6. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards) in line 108
   - The socketFilePath function returns a QString without checking if the QString is empty. This could lead to a situation where an empty string is returned, which could cause problems in other parts of the code.
   - Solution: Add a check to ensure the QString is not empty before returning it.
