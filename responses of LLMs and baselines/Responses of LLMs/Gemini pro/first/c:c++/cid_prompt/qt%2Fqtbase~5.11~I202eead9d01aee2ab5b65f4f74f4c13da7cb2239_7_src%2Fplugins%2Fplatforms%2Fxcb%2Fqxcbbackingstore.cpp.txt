1.CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
   - In the QXcbShmImage constructor, the pixel data is stored in m_xcb_image->data without any checks to ensure that the data is valid or accessible. This could lead to undefined behavior or crashes if the data is not properly allocated or accessible.
2.CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
   - In the QXcbShmImage constructor, the segment size is not checked before it is used to create the shared memory segment. If the segment size is too large, it could lead to a denial of service attack as the system may run out of memory.
3.CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)
   - The code uses a number of non-standard functions and macros, such as xcb_shm_create_segment() and xcb_shm_attach(), which are not part of the standard XCB library. This could make the code difficult to understand and maintain.
