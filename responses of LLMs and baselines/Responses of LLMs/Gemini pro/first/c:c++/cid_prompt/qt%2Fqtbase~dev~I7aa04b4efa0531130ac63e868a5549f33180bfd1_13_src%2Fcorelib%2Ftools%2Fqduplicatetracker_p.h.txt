CWE detected in the code:

1. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

   Description: This defect occurs when the code does not adhere to established coding standards. In this case, the code uses the `#ifdef` preprocessor directive to define different code paths based on the availability of the `<memory_resource>` header, which is a non-standard C++ library header. This may lead to unexpected behavior if the header is not available on the target system, or if the code is compiled with a different compiler or set of compiler flags.

   Line Number: 56-61

   Solution: Instead of using `#ifdef` to conditionally include different code paths, the code should use the standard C++ `#include` directive to include the `<memory_resource>` header only if it is available. This will ensure that the code compiles correctly on all target systems and with different compilers.

   Updated Code:

   ```c++
   #include <memory_resource>

   #if __has_include(<unordered_set>)
   #  include <unordered_set>
   #else
   #  include <qset.h>
   #endif
   ```
