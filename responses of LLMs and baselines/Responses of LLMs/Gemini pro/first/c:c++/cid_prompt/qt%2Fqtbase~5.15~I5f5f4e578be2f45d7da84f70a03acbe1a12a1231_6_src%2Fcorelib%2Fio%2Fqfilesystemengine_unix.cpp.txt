Line 1197: CWE-284 Improper Access Control:
In the QFileSystemEngine::createLink function, it attempts to create a symbolic link using the symlink() system call without checking if the user has the necessary permissions to do so. An attacker could exploit this to create symbolic links to sensitive files or directories, leading to unauthorized access.

Line 1204: CWE-682 Incorrect Calculation:
The QFileSystemEngine::stickyBitSet function calculates whether the sticky bit is set for a file or directory by using the stat() system call. However, it does not handle the case where stat() fails, which could lead to incorrect results and potential security implications.

Line 1347: CWE-682 Incorrect Calculation:
In the QFileSystemEngine::moveFileToTrash function, it generates a unique file name by appending a counter to the file name. However, it increments the counter and generates a new file name until it finds a unique file name. If an attacker can manipulate the number of files in the trash directory, they could potentially cause the counter to wrap around, leading to a collision and overwriting an existing file.

Line 1425: CWE-284 Improper Access Control:
In the QFileSystemEngine::renameFile function, it attempts to rename a file or directory using the rename() system call without checking if the user has the necessary permissions to do so. An attacker could exploit this to rename files or directories to sensitive locations, leading to unauthorized access or data loss.
