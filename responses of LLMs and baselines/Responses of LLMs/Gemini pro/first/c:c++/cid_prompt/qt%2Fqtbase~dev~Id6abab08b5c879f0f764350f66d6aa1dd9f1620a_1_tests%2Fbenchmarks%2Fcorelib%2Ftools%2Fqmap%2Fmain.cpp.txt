1. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
   - Line 211: `std::map` is passed by value, which unnecessarily copies it. To avoid this defect, pass it by reference instead.

2. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
   - Line 227: The condition `if (it == end)` checks if the iterator `it` reaches the end of the map. If the map is empty, `it` is already at the end, so the `++it` operation is unnecessary and may lead to undefined behavior.

3. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
   - Line 178: Using `QString::replace()` inside a loop may cause problems with buffer management and string reallocation. It's better to use a more efficient approach for string concatenation.

The corrected code:

1. CWE-664:
   - Line 211:
     ```c++
     QBENCHMARK {
         std::map<int, int>& n = map.toStdMap();
         n.begin();
     }
     ```

2. CWE-703:
   - Line 227:
     ```c++
     if (it != end)
         ++it;
     ```

3. CWE-710:
   - Line 178:
     ```c++
     str += map.value(str);
     ```

     can be replaced with:
     ```c++
     str.append(map.value(str));
     ```
     or
     ```c++
     str = str + map.value(str);
     ```
