CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
In line 570, `bool QLocalSocket::waitForBytesWritten(int msecs)` compares a 64-bit value to a 32-bit value. There is no explicit conversion specified, and the comparison may lead to incorrect results if the `msecs` value is out of range.
```
bool QLocalSocket::waitForBytesWritten(int msecs)
```
**Solution:**
Explicitly convert `msecs` to a 64-bit value before performing the comparison to ensure correct behavior for all values.
```
bool QLocalSocket::waitForBytesWritten(qint64 msecs)
```
CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
In line 647, the calculation of the timeout `const int timeout = (msec > 0) ? qMax(msec - timer.elapsed(), Q_INT64_C(0)) : msec;` may lead to incorrect results for large values of `msec`. The subtraction of `timer.elapsed()` from `msec` can result in an underflow, causing the timeout to be set to a negative value, which is not handled correctly.
```
const int timeout = (msec > 0) ? qMax(msec - timer.elapsed(), Q_INT64_C(0)) : msec;
```
**Solution:**
Use a proper overflow check to ensure that the timeout is always non-negative.
```
const int timeout = (msec > 0) ? qMax(msec - timer.elapsed(), qint64(0)) : msec;
```
