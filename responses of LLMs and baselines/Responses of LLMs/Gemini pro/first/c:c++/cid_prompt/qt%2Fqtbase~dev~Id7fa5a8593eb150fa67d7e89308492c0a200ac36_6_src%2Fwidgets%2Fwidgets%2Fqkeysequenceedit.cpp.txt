CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
Line 70. The user interface does not validate the input to the `keySequence` property. An attacker could provide arbitrary characters, including potentially malicious code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.

Solution: The application should validate the input to the `keySequence` property to ensure that it does not contain any malicious characters. This can be done using a regular expression or other suitable validation mechanism.

CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
Line 182. The `maxKeyCount` property is not properly updated when it is modified using the `setMaxKeyCount` method. This can lead to incorrect behavior if the user attempts to set a key sequence that exceeds the maximum allowed number of keys.

Solution: The application should update the internal `maxKeyCount` property when the `setMaxKeyCount` method is called. This will ensure that the key sequence is properly truncated if it exceeds the maximum allowed number of keys.

CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
Line 305. The `key` array is not properly initialized before it is used to construct the `keySequence` object. This can lead to incorrect behavior if the `key` array contains uninitialized values.

Solution: The application should initialize the `key` array to zero before it is used to construct the `keySequence` object. This will ensure that the `keySequence` object is properly constructed with all of the keys set to the appropriate values.

CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
Line 286. The application does not handle the case where the `QKeyMapper::possibleKeys` method returns an empty list. This can lead to incorrect behavior if the user attempts to use a modifier key that is not supported by the system.

Solution: The application should handle the case where the `QKeyMapper::possibleKeys` method returns an empty list by returning early or by throwing an exception. This will ensure that the application does not crash if the user attempts to use an unsupported modifier key.
