CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): The code does not perform any access control checks before accessing resources such as the SDK, NDK, and other files. An attacker could potentially exploit this to gain unauthorized access to these resources.

CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities): The code does not properly handle the interaction between multiple components, such as the SDK, NDK, and other tools. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through Its Lifetime): The code does not properly manage the lifetime of resources, such as file handles and processes. This could lead to resource leaks and other security issues.

CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): The code does not perform proper calculations and may lead to incorrect results. This could result in unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): The code does not properly manage control flow and may be vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities.

CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): The code does not properly implement security mechanisms, such as input validation and authentication, which could allow an attacker to bypass these protections.

CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): The code does not perform proper comparisons and may lead to incorrect results. This could result in unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): The code does not properly handle exceptional conditions and may fail to handle errors in a secure manner. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): The code does not properly neutralize user-supplied input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code or data.

CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): The code does not adhere to coding standards and may contain security vulnerabilities due to poor coding practices.
