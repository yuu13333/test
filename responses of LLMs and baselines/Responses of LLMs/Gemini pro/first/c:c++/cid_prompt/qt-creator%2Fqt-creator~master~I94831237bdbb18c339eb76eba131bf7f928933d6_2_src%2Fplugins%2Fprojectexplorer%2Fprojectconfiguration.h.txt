1. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)** [line 136-141]:
   - The code uses `qobject_cast` to check if an aspect is of a specific type. However, this check does not handle the case where the aspect is not of the expected type. This could allow an attacker to pass in an unexpected type and gain access to sensitive data or functionality.
   - Solution: Use `dynamic_cast` to check the type of the aspect, which will throw a `bad_cast` exception if the cast fails.

2. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)** [line 66-67]:
   - The `bool` variable `m_visible` is public and can be directly accessed and modified by any code that has access to the `ProjectConfigurationAspect` object. This violates the principle of encapsulation and can lead to unintended consequences.
   - Solution: Make the `m_visible` variable private and provide getter and setter methods to control access.
