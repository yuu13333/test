CWE-284 (CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is detected at line 67:
```cpp
QDeadlineTimer objects can be passed to functions being called to execute
this operation so they know how long to still operate.
```
Solution: Clearly define the access control mechanism for QDeadlineTimer objects and ensure that only authorized functions or code can access and modify them.

CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities) is detected at line 51:
```cpp
QDeadlineTimer objects can be passed to functions being called to execute
this operation so they know how long to still operate.
```
Solution: Clearly define the responsibilities and interactions between QDeadlineTimer objects and the functions or code that use them. Ensure that they are properly synchronized and communicate with each other in a well-defined manner.

CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) is detected at line 212:
```cpp
If that happens, deadline() may return an unexpected value and this object cannot be used in calculation of how long it is overdue. If that
```
Solution: Ensure that QDeadlineTimer objects are properly initialized and their lifetime is managed correctly. Avoid creating QDeadlineTimer objects in a way that could lead to indeterminate or unexpected behavior.

CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization) is detected at line 317:
```cpp
if (QDeadlineTimerNanosecondsInT2) {
t1 += secs + toSecsAndNSecs(nsecs).first;
t2 += toSecsAndNSecs(nsecs).second;
if (t2 > 1000*1000*1000) {
t2 -= 1000*1000*1000;
++t1;
}
}
```
Solution: Ensure that inputs to QDeadlineTimer functions are properly validated and sanitized to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards) is detected at line 522:
```cpp
return t1;
```
Solution: Follow coding standards and guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability of the QDeadlineTimer code. This may include using proper indentation, naming conventions, and error handling practices.
