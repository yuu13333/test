- Line 50 of the code indicates that the finished signal of the QFutureWatcher is connected to a slot onProjectInfoGenerated. This is an example of CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure) as it doesn't check if the future was completed successfully or not.
- Line 62 and 66 of the code has a potential of CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation) as the number of total extraCompilers is not calculated and the progress value is updated without checking the actual number of extraCompilers.
- Line 129 the future is being set to an empty QFuture, which can be considered CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure) as it doesn't handle the case of correctly cancelling the future.
