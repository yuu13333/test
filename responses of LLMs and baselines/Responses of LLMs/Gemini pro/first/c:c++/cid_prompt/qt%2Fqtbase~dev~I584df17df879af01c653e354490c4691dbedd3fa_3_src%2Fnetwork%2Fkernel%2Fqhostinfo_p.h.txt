There is one security defect found in the provided code.

1. CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions

   Description: The code does not properly handle the case where the application terminates before the results of a DNS lookup are delivered. This can lead to memory leaks and other issues.

   Line number: 109-111

   Solution: The code should be modified to ensure that any pending DNS lookups are canceled or completed before the application exits. This can be done by adding a call to QHostInfoLookupManager::clear() in the QCoreApplication::aboutToQuit event handler.
