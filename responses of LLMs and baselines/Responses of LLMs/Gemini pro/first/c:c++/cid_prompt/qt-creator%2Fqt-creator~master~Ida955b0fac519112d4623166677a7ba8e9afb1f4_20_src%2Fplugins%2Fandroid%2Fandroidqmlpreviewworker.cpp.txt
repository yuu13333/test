CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)

Line 435
The rcc process is initiated and started. However, the subprocess is never joined. This might result in the process surviving after the AndroidQmlPreviewWorker object is destroyed, which could lead to undefined behavior and resource leaks.

To fix this issue, the rcc process should be joined and waited upon after starting it, like so:

```
rccProcess.start();
if (!rccProcess.waitForStarted()) {
    // Handle the error
}
rccProcess.waitForFinished();
```
