1. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): Line 263 may throw an exception if the `m_future` is not ready (for example, if any of the dependencies of the returned `std::future<void>` are not ready). This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.

2. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): Line 263 may not be reachable if the `m_future` throws an exception. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.

## Recommendations

1. To fix the CWE-703 issue, add proper error handling to Line 263. For example, you can use `m_future.wait()` to wait for the future to complete or `m_future.get()` to get the result and handle any exceptions that may be thrown.

2. To fix the CWE-707 issue, ensure that Line 263 is reachable even if the `m_future` throws an exception. For example, you can use a `try/catch` block to catch any exceptions thrown by `m_future.get()` and handle them appropriately.
