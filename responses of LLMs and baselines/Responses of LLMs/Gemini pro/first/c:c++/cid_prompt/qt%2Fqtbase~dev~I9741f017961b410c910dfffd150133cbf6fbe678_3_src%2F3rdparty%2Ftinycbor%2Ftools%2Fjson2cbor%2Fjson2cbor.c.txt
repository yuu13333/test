6. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)

- Line 161: When decoding a hexadecimal string, this code incorrectly calculates the value of a character by subtracting '0' from its ASCII value. This may result in an incorrect calculation for characters in the range ['a', 'f'].

- Line 171: Similar to the previous issue, this code incorrectly calculates the value of a character by subtracting '0' from its ASCII value when decoding a hexadecimal string.

7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)

- Line 215: This code incorrectly compares the result of `sscanf` to 0 instead of using a proper return value check to determine if the conversion was successful.

9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)

- Line 200: This code uses `asprintf` to allocate memory for a string without properly checking the return value. This may result in a buffer overflow if the memory allocation fails.

10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)

- Line 298: This code uses a `default` case in a `switch` statement without a `break` statement, which may lead to unintended behavior.
