1. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): Incorrect calculation of device pixel ratio (`dpr`) variable in `frame()` function. When calculating the viewport size using `glViewport()`, the `dpr` variable is inadvertently used twice, resulting in an incorrect viewport size.
   - **Proposed Change:** Calculate the viewport size correctly with `glViewport(0, 0, screen()->geometry().width() * dpr, screen()->geometry().height() * dpr);`.


2. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): Incorrect comparison of `fill` color to `shade` and `light` colors in `drawShadePanel()`. The comparison is made to check if the `fill` color is the same as the `shade` or `light` color. However, the comparison logic is not correct and might lead to incorrect results.
   - **Proposed Change:** Replace the comparison to `shade` and `light` colors with the correct comparison operators (`fill->color() == light` and `fill->color() == shade`) to ensure the correct logic.
