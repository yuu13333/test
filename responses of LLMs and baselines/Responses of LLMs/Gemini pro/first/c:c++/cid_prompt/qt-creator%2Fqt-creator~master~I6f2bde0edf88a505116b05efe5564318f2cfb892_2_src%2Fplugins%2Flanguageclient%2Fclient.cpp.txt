This code deals with multiple security issues. Here is a detailed description of the defects found during the review:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
   - Line 93: The m_diagnostic map is not guarded against unauthorized access.
   - Line 141: The m_highlights map is not guarded against unauthorized access.
   - Line 327: The m_openedDocument map is not guarded against unauthorized access.


2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
   - Line 144: The contents of m_highlights are modified while it is being iterated over in the loop, which could lead to undefined behavior.


3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
   - Lines 78-92: The TextMark objects created in this loop do not have their lifetimes properly managed, leading to memory leaks.


4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
   - Line 516: The document revision may not be updated correctly when saving a document if willSave is false.


5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
   - Lines 268-269: The state is updated to InitializeRequested without checking the response from the server, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the server does not respond as expected.


6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
   - Line 356: The message ID is removed from the response handlers without checking if the request was successful, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the request failed.


7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):
   - Line 490: The syncKind comparison uses `!=` instead of `==`, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the sync kind is not None.


8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
   - Line 1173: The error handling code does not properly handle errors that occur while parsing the content of a message.


9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
   - Line 964: The content of messages is not properly sanitized before being parsed, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.


10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
    - The code does not follow a consistent coding style, which can make it difficult to read and maintain.

To resolve the above issues, the following changes can be made to the code:

1. For CWE-284, add access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can access the maps.


2. For CWE-435, iterate over a copy of the m_highlights map to avoid modifying it while iterating.


3. For CWE-664, use a smart pointer or a RAII idiom to properly manage the lifetime of the TextMark objects.


4. For CWE-682, properly update the document revision when willSave is false.


5. For CWE-691, check the response from the server before updating the state to InitializeRequested.


6. For CWE-693, check if the request was successful before removing the message ID from the response handlers.


7. For CWE-697, use `==` instead of `!=` in the syncKind comparison.


8. For CWE-703, handle errors that occur while parsing the content of a message appropriately.


9. For CWE-707, properly sanitize the content of messages before parsing them.


10. For CWE-710, refactor the code to follow a consistent coding style.

After implementing the above changes, this code should be more secure and reliable.
