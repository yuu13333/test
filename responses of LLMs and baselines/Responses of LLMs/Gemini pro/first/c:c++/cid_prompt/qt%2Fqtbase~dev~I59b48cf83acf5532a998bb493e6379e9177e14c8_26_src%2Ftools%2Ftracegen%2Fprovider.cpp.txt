A potential security defect is found in the 'parseProvider' function:

**Line(s):** 221-224
**Defect Type:** CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)

**Description:** The function does not perform any access control checks before opening the file specified by the 'filename' parameter. This could allow an attacker to read sensitive information from restricted files by passing a crafted filename in the 'filename' parameter.

**Solution:**

```cpp
if (!f.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly | QIODevice::Text | QIODevice::Secure))
```

By adding the 'Secure' flag to the 'open' method, the function ensures that the file is opened in a secure manner, preventing unauthorized access.
