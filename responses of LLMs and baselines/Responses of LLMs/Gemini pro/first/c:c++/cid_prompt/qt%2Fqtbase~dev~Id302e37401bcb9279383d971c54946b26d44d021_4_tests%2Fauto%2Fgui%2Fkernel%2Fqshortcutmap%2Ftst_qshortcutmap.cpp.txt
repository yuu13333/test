1.CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions) (Line 91):
   The QShortcutMap::addShortcut() function is called without checking if the owner object is valid or not. If the owner object has already been deleted, this could lead to a crash when the shortcut is triggered.
   Solution: Check if the owner object is valid before adding the shortcut. For example:
   ```cpp
   if (badOwner && badOwner->isValid()) {
       QGuiApplicationPrivate::instance()->shortcutMap.addShortcut(
           badOwner, QKeySequence(QKeySequence::StandardKey::Delete),
           Qt::ShortcutContext::WindowShortcut, simpleContextMatcher);
   }
   ```
