CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization) in line 440:

```
virtual qreal maxCharWidth() const override { return 0; }
```

The method `maxCharWidth()` returns the maximum character width of the font without any proper validation. An attacker could provide a malicious input to the method, causing the function to return an incorrect value and potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the application.

The correct fix is to add proper input validation to ensure that the value returned by the method is accurate. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the input is within a valid range or by using a more robust validation mechanism.

Here is the corrected code:

```
virtual qreal maxCharWidth() const override {
  // Add proper input validation here
  return 0;
}
```

CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization) in line 442:

```
virtual qreal minLeftBearing() const override { return 0; }
```

The method `minLeftBearing()` returns the minimum left bearing of the font without any proper validation. An attacker could provide a malicious input to the method, causing the function to return an incorrect value and potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the application.

The correct fix is to add proper input validation to ensure that the value returned by the method is accurate. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the input is within a valid range or by using a more robust validation mechanism.

Here is the corrected code:

```
virtual qreal minLeftBearing() const override {
  // Add proper input validation here
  return 0;
}
```

CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization) in line 443:

```
virtual qreal minRightBearing() const override { return 0; }
```

The method `minRightBearing()` returns the minimum right bearing of the font without any proper validation. An attacker could provide a malicious input to the method, causing the function to return an incorrect value and potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the application.

The correct fix is to add proper input validation to ensure that the value returned by the method is accurate. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the input is within a valid range or by using a more robust validation mechanism.

Here is the corrected code:

```
virtual qreal minRightBearing() const override {
  // Add proper input validation here
  return 0;
}
