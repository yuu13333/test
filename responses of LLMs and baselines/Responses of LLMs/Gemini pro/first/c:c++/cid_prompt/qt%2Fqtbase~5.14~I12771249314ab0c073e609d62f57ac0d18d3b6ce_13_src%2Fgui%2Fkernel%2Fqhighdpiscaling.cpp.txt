1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)

   - Line 73: The function `qEnvironmentVariableAsBool` does not properly validate the user-provided input before converting it to a boolean value, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the input is malicious or crafted to cause harm.

2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)

   - Line 570: The function `mapPositionToNative` assumes that the provided platform screen is valid and does not perform any checks to ensure that it is a legitimate platform screen object. This lack of validation could potentially lead to issues if an invalid or malicious platform screen object is provided.

3. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)

   - Line 530: The function `setGlobalFactor` contains a redundant check for equality using `qFuzzyCompare` before setting the `m_factor` variable, which is unnecessary and does not add any additional value to the code. This could potentially be removed to improve code clarity and efficiency.
