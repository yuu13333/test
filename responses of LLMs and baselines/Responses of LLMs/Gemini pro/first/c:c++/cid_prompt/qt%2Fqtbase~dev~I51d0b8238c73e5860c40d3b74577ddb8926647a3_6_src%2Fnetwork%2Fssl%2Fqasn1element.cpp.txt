The following security defects are detected:

1. Improper Access Control (CWE-284):
   - Line 381: The code uses a global variable `oidNameMap` to map object IDs to their corresponding names. This map is created using the `createOidMap` function, which is called in a global constructor. This means that the map is shared among all instances of the `QAsn1Element` class, which could lead to unintended sharing of sensitive information between different parts of the code.
   - Line 382: The `toObjectName` method uses the `oidNameMap` to convert an object ID to its corresponding name. This means that an attacker could modify the map to map sensitive object IDs to arbitrary names, which could be used to bypass access control mechanisms.

2. Insufficient Control Flow Management (CWE-691):
   - Line 247: The `toDateTime` method checks the size of the ASN.1 value to ensure that it is 13 or 15 bytes long. However, it does not handle the case where the value is not of the expected size, which could lead to unexpected behavior or a crash.

3. Incorrect Comparison (CWE-697):
   - Line 257: The `toDateTime` method uses the `isAsciiDigit` function to check if each character in the ASN.1 value is a digit. However, the function does not handle the case where the value contains non-ASCII characters, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. Improper Neutralization (CWE-707):
   - Line 271: The `toDateTime` method uses the `QDateTime::fromString` function to parse the ASN.1 value as a date/time string. However, it does not handle the case where the value contains invalid characters or an invalid format, which could lead to incorrect results.
   - Line 294: The `toDateTime` method uses the `QDateTime::fromString` function to parse the ASN.1 value as a date/time string. However, it does not handle the case where the value contains invalid characters or an invalid format, which could lead to incorrect results.

5. Incorrect Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-703):
   - Line 332: The `toInteger` method checks if the ASN.1 value is of the expected type (IntegerType) and is not empty. However, it does not handle the case where the value is of the wrong type or is empty, which could lead to unexpected behavior or a crash.

To mitigate these defects, the following actions should be taken:

1. For CWE-284:
   - The `oidNameMap` should be replaced with a thread-local map or a map that is scoped to a specific object or context. This will prevent unintended sharing of sensitive information between different parts of the code.
   - The `toObjectName` method should be modified to validate the object ID before using it to look up the corresponding name in the map. This will prevent an attacker from modifying the map to map sensitive object IDs to arbitrary names.

2. For CWE-691:
   - The `toDateTime` method should be modified to handle the case where the ASN.1 value is not of the expected size. It should either return an error or a default value in this case.

3. For CWE-697:
   - The `isAsciiDigit` function should be modified to handle non-ASCII characters. It should return false for non-ASCII characters to ensure that the `toDateTime` method handles them correctly.

4. For CWE-707:
   - The `toDateTime` method should be modified to handle invalid characters and invalid formats in the ASN.1 value. It should either return an error or a default value in this case.

5. For CWE-703:
   - The `toInteger` method should be modified to handle the case where the ASN.1 value is of the wrong type or is empty. It should either return an error or a default value in this case.
