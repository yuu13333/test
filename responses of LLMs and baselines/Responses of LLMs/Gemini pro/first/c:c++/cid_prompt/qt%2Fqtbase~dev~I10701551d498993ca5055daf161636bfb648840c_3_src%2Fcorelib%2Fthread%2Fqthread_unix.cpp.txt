CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
Line 769:
```c++
if (!d->data->threadId.loadRelaxed())
    return;
```

This line checks if the thread has a valid ID before attempting to terminate it. If the ID is invalid, the function returns immediately, preventing improper access to the thread.

Line 777:
```c++
if (code) {
    qErrnoWarning(code, "QThread::start: Thread termination error");
}
```

This line displays an error message if the thread termination fails, indicating that there was an issue with the termination process. This helps to identify and debug potential access control issues related to thread termination.
