1. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
   - Line 424: The calculation of the minimum size of the item may be incorrect as it does not take into account the actual size of the custom icon.
   - Solution: Modify the calculation to correctly factor in the custom icon size when determining the minimum size.

2. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)
   - Line 369: The code assumes that the `templateDisplay` attribute of `DClass` will always be valid, but it should check for potential null pointer exceptions.
   - Solution: Add a null check to ensure that `templateDisplay` is not null before using it.

3. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
   - Line 360: The code does not handle the case where `templateDisplay` is equal to `DClass::TemplateSmart`, which can lead to incorrect behavior.
   - Solution: Add a check for this case and handle it appropriately, such as by defaulting to a specific template display option.

4. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)
   - The code does not follow a consistent coding style, with some lines using tabs and others using spaces for indentation.
   - Solution: Enforce a consistent coding style throughout the codebase, such as using tabs for indentation and following a specific naming convention for variables and functions.
