The following security defects are present in the provided code:

**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):**
The code does not sufficiently check for user permissions before allowing access to certain features or resources. Specifically, when the user creates a new CMake configuration, the code does not verify that the user has the necessary permissions to do so. This could allow an unauthorized user to create a new configuration and potentially gain access to sensitive information or perform malicious actions.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):**
The code does not properly handle interactions between multiple entities, leading to potential conflicts or unexpected behavior. Specifically, when the user changes the build type or the initial CMake arguments, the code does not update the configuration accordingly. This could result in inconsistencies or errors when building the project.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):**
The code does not properly manage the lifetime of resources, leading to potential memory leaks or other resource exhaustion issues. Specifically, when the user creates a new CMake configuration, the code does not properly clean up the previous configuration. This could lead to memory leaks and other performance problems.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**
The code does not properly handle calculations, leading to potential errors or incorrect results. Specifically, when the user changes the build type or the initial CMake arguments, the code does not recalculate the configuration changes. This could result in incorrect build results or errors.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):**
The code does not properly manage control flow, leading to potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior. Specifically, when the user creates a new CMake configuration, the code does not properly handle errors or exceptions that may occur. This could allow an attacker to exploit these errors to gain access to sensitive information or perform malicious actions.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):**
The code does not properly implement protection mechanisms, leading to potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior. Specifically, when the user changes the build type or the initial CMake arguments, the code does not properly validate the input to ensure that it is valid. This could allow an attacker to provide malicious input that could lead to security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):**
The code does not properly handle comparisons, leading to potential errors or incorrect results. Specifically, when the user changes the build type or the initial CMake arguments, the code does not properly compare the new values to the previous values to determine if any changes have been made. This could result in incorrect behavior or errors.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):**
The code does not properly handle exceptional conditions, leading to potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior. Specifically, when the user creates a new CMake configuration, the code does not properly handle errors or exceptions that may occur. This could allow an attacker to exploit these errors to gain access to sensitive information or perform malicious actions.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):**
The code does not properly neutralize user-supplied input, leading to potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior. Specifically, when the user changes the build type or the initial CMake arguments, the code does not properly validate the input to ensure that it is valid. This could allow an attacker to provide malicious input that could lead to security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):**
The code does not properly adhere to coding standards, leading to potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior. Specifically, the code does not properly handle error handling, input validation, and resource management. This could result in security vulnerabilities, errors, or unexpected behavior.
