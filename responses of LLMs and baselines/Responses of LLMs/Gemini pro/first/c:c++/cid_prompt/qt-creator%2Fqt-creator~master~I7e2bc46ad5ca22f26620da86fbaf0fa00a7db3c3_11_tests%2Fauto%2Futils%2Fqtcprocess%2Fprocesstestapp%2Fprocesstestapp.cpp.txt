1.CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
   - Line 60: The code compares the environment variable with a constant string without any validation. This may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by setting the environment variable to a malicious value.
   - Solution: Use a more secure method to validate the environment variable, such as using a white-list or a more secure comparison.

2.CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)
   - Line 63: The code returns the result of the sub-process without checking the return value, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by returning a malicious value.
   - Solution: Check the return value of the sub-process before returning it.


3.CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
   - Line 185: The code attempts to lock a mutex twice, which can lead to a deadlock.
   - Solution: Check if the mutex is already locked before attempting to lock it again.


4.CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
   - Line 213: The code compares the current depth with 1, which may lead to an incorrect result if the depth is not 1.
   - Solution: Use a more robust comparison, such as comparing the depth with 0.


5.CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)
   - Line 243: The code compares the exit status with QProcess::NormalExit, which may lead to an incorrect result if the exit status is not QProcess::NormalExit.
   - Solution: Use a more robust comparison, such as comparing the exit status with 0.
