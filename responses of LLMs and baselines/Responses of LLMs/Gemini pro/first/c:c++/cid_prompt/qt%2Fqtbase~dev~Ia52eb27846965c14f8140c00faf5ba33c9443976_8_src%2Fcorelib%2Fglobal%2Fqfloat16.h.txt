The following security defects are found in the given code:

1. **CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime** (Line 111):

   The `memcpy` function is used to copy the value of a `float` variable into a `quint32` variable without checking the size of the input data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the size of the `quint32` variable.

   To fix this defect, you should use a safer function such as `std::memcpy` that checks the size of the input data before copying it.


2. **CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management** (Line 246, 259, 273, 287, 301):

   The code does not properly handle the case when either of the input operands to the comparison operators (`>, <, >=, <=, ==`) is not a finite number (i.e., NaN or infinity). This can lead to incorrect results or undefined behavior.

   To fix this defect, you should add checks to ensure that both operands are finite before performing the comparison. For example, you could add the following code at the beginning of each branch:

   ```c++
   if (qIsFinite(a) == false || qIsFinite(b) == false) {
       return float(a) < float(b);
   }
   ```


3. **CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison** (Line 252, 266, 280, 294):

   The code uses the `>` and `<` operators to compare signed integers (i.e., `qint16`), which can lead to incorrect results. This is because the `>` and `<` operators are defined for unsigned integers and will perform an unsigned comparison if the operands are signed integers.

   To fix this defect, you should use the `>=` and `<=` operators to compare signed integers. For example, you could replace the following code:

   ```c++
   if (a.isPositive() || b.isPositive())
       return qint16(a.b16) > qint16(b.b16);
   ```

   with the following code:

   ```c++
   if (a.isPositive() || b.isPositive())
       return qint16(a.b16) >= qint16(b.b16);
   ```
