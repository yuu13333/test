1. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)** (Line 156)

   - **Description**:  The Python code is loaded from a file on the file system without applying any access control or input validation. This makes the plugin vulnerable to arbitrary code execution attacks by loading malicious Python code into the plugin directory.

   - **Solution**: Implement proper access control to restrict the loading of Python code only from authorized sources. Additionally, validate the Python code before execution to detect and prevent the execution of malicious code.

2. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)** (Line 142)

   - **Description**: The calculation of the number of Python extensions found subtracts 2 from the total number of entries in the `extension_names` list, assuming that the list contains exactly two "special" files (`.` and `..`). However, this assumption may not be valid on all file systems, leading to an incorrect count of the number of extensions.

   - **Solution**: Determine the number of "special" files in the `extension_names` list dynamically to ensure an accurate count of the number of extensions.

3. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)** (Line 158)

   - **Description**: The code uses `!` to negate the result of `PyUtil::runScript()` instead of using the more idiomatic Pythonic way of checking for a `False` result.

   - **Solution**: Change the condition to `if (!PyUtil::runScript(extension_code.toStdString()))` to adhere to Pythonic coding standards.
