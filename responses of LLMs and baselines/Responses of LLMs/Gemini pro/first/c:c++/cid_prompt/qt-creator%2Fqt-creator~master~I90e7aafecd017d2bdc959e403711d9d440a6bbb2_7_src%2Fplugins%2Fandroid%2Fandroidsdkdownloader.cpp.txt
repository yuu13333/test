1. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):

   - **Line 161:** The error message from `file.errorString()` is not properly handled and could lead to incorrect or incomplete error reporting.

   - **Line 160:** The `file` variable is opened in a write-only mode, but it is not closed properly if the file cannot be opened.

3. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):

   - **Line 177:** The comparison of status codes for HTTP redirects should be done using `QNetworkReply::RedirectionTargetAttribute` instead of `QNetworkRequest::HttpStatusCodeAttribute`.

     return reply->attribute(QNetworkRequest::RedirectionTargetAttribute).isValid();
     ```

4. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):

   - **Line 190:** The logic for handling HTTP redirects does not properly handle the case where the redirect URL is invalid.
