1. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**

   - Line 120: The `LauncherInterfacePrivate::doStart()` function does not handle the case where the server fails to listen on the socket. This could lead to a denial of service attack if an attacker is able to prevent the server from listening on the socket.
   - **Solution**: Add a check to ensure that the server is listening on the socket before starting the process.

2. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**

   - Line 136: The `LauncherInterfacePrivate::doStart()` function starts the process with the full server name as an argument. This could lead to command injection if an attacker is able to provide a server name that contains malicious code.
   - **Solution**: Escape the server name before starting the process.

3. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

   - Line 178: The `LauncherInterfacePrivate::handleProcessStderr()` function prints the standard error output of the process to the debug stream. This could lead to information disclosure if the process is able to write sensitive information to the standard error stream.
   - **Solution**: Use a more secure logging mechanism, such as syslog, to log the standard error output of the process.
