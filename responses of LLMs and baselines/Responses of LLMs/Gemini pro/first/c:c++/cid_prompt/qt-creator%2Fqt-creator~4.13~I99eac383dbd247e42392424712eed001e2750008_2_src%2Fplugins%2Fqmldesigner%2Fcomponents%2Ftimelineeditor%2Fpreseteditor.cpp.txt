1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - In the `PresetEditor::update` method, the curve is updated without checking whether the current widget is `m_presets`. This allows the curve to be updated in the system presets, even if the user is currently viewing the custom presets, leading to a potential access control issue.
   - **Solution**: Add a check to ensure that the curve is only updated in the current widget, preventing unauthorized modification of the system presets.

2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - In the `PresetList::revert` method, the curve is reverted to a previous version without properly cleaning up the previous version's resources (such as the associated icon). This can lead to memory leaks and resource exhaustion over time.
   - **Solution**: Implement proper resource cleanup when reverting to a previous version of the curve, ensuring that all associated resources are released to prevent memory leaks.

3. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
   - In the `PresetList::selectionChanged` method, there is insufficient control flow management when handling the `QMessageBox` buttons. The button labels are modified, but the button functionality is not updated accordingly, leading to potential confusion and unexpected behavior.
   - **Solution**: Update the button functionality to match the modified button labels, ensuring that the buttons perform the intended actions.

4. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
   - In the `PresetEditor::writePresets` method, there is a protection mechanism failure when attempting to save an invalid curve. The error message is displayed, but the invalid curve is still allowed to be saved, potentially leading to incorrect or unexpected behavior in the application.
   - **Solution**: Implement proper validation of the curve before saving, preventing invalid curves from being saved and ensuring the integrity of the presets.
