Line 576 contains a security defect. The code does not check the return value of the pdfork() function and assumes that the function always succeeds. However, if the function fails, the code will continue to use uninitialized variables, leading to undefined behavior and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.

To fix this issue, the code should check the return value of pdfork() and handle the error case appropriately. For example, the code could return an error to the caller or log the error to a file.

Here is the fixed code:

```cpp
#if defined(FORKFD_NO_SPAWNFD) && defined(__FreeBSD__) && __FreeBSD__ >= 9
/* PROCDESC is an optional feature in the kernel and wasn't enabled
 * by default on FreeBSD 9. So we need to check for it at runtime. */
static ffd_atomic_int system_has_forkfd = FFD_ATOMIC_INIT(1);
#elif __FreeBSD__ == 9
/* On FreeBSD 9, PROCDESC wasn't compiled into the kernel: don't try it again. */
static const int system_has_forkfd = 0;
#else
/* On FreeBSD 10, PROCDESC was enabled by default. On v11, it's not an option
 * anymore and can't be disabled. */
static const int system_has_forkfd = 1;
#endif

static int system_forkfd(int flags, pid_t *ppid)
{
    int ret;
    pid_t pid;

    pid = pdfork(&ret, PD_DAEMON);
    if (__builtin_expect(pid == -1, 0)) {
#if __FreeBSD__ == 9
        if (errno == ENOSYS) {
            /* PROCDESC wasn't compiled into the kernel: don't try it again. */
            ffd_atomic_store(&system_has_forkfd, 0, FFD_ATOMIC_RELAXED);
        }
#endif
        return -1;
    }
    if (pid == 0) {
        /* child process */
        return FFD_CHILD_PROCESS;
    }

    /* parent process */
    if (flags & FFD_CLOEXEC)
        fcntl(ret, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC);
    if (flags & FFD_NONBLOCK)
        fcntl(ret, F_SETFL, fcntl(ret, F_GETFL) | O_NONBLOCK);
    if (ppid)
        *ppid = pid;
    return ret;
}
```
