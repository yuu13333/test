Line 924:
QQuaternion QQuaternion::slerp(const QQuaternion& q1, const QQuaternion& q2, float t)
{
    // Handle the easy cases first.
    if (t <= 0.0f)
        return q1;
    else if (t >= 1.0f)
        return q2;

The code does not handle the case when `t` is negative but less than -1. In this case, the function should return `q2` instead of `q1`. This is because the function is supposed to interpolate between `q1` and `q2` along the shortest spherical path, and if `t` is negative, it means that we want to travel in the opposite direction, which is towards `q2`.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
QQuaternion QQuaternion::slerp(const QQuaternion& q1, const QQuaternion& q2, float t)
{
    // Handle the easy cases first.
    if (t <= -1.0f)
        return q2;
    else if (t >= 1.0f)
        return q2;
```
