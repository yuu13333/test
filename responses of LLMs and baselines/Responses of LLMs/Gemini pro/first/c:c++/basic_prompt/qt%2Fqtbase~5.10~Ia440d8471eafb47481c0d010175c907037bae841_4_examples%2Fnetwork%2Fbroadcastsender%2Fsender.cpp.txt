The code above has a security defect on lines 96 and 97. The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because the size of the datagram is not checked before it is sent. An attacker could send a datagram that is larger than the size of the buffer, which could cause the program to crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This could be mitigated by checking the size of the datagram before it is sent, and only sending datagrams that are within a certain size limit.
