Line 670: The `void GraphicsScene::keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent *event)` method does not have a default action for removing the selected items when the `event->key()` is `Qt::Key_Delete`, which could lead to a security issue where the user is unable to delete selected items using the `Delete` key.
Line 682: The `void GraphicsScene::mousePressEvent(QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent *event)` method does not have proper input validation for the `event->button()` when the `event->button()` is `Qt::RightButton`, which could lead to a security issue where an attacker could execute arbitrary code by triggering the right-click menu.
