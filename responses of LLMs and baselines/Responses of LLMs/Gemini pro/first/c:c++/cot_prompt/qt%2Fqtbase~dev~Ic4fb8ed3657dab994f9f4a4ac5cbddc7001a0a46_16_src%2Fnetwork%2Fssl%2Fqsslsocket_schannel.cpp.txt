No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code appears to be secure and follows best practices for handling SSL/TLS connections. It uses the Schannel API to establish a secure connection between the client and the server, and it verifies the peer certificate to ensure that it is valid and trusted. The code also handles errors and exceptions in a secure manner, and it does not expose any sensitive information.\n\nHere are some specific examples of secure coding practices that are followed in the code:\n\n* The code uses the Schannel API to establish a secure connection between the client and the server. Schannel is a secure communication protocol that is built into Windows and provides strong encryption and authentication.\n* The code verifies the peer certificate to ensure that it is valid and trusted. This is done by checking the certificate's signature, expiration date, and issuer.\n* The code handles errors and exceptions in a secure manner. For example, if the peer certificate is invalid or expired, the code will raise an error and disconnect the connection.\n* The code does not expose any sensitive information. For example, the code does not log the peer certificate or the session keys.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be secure and follows best practices for handling SSL/TLS connections.
