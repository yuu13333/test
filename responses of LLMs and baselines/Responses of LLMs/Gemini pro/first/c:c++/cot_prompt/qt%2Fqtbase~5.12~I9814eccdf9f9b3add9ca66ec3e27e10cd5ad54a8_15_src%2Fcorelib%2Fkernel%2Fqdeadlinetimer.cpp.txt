No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code defines two classes, `Square` and `Cube`, which represent geometric shapes. The `Square` class has methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a square, while the `Cube` class inherits from `Square` and adds methods to calculate the volume and surface area of a cube. The `main` function creates instances of `Square` and `Cube` and prints their properties.\n\nThe code does not handle any user input or perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities. It is purely a mathematical calculation of geometric properties. Therefore, there are no security defects in the code.
