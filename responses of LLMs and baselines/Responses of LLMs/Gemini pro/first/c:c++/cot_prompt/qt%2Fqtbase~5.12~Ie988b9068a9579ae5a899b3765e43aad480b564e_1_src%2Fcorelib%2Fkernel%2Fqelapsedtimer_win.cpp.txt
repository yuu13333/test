No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code is related to the implementation of high-resolution timers on Windows. It uses the `QueryPerformanceCounter` and `GetTickCount64` functions to obtain the current time. These functions are considered secure and do not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe code also handles the case when `QueryPerformanceCounter` fails and falls back to `GetTickCount64`. This ensures that the timer functionality is still available even if the high-resolution timer is not supported.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security defects.
