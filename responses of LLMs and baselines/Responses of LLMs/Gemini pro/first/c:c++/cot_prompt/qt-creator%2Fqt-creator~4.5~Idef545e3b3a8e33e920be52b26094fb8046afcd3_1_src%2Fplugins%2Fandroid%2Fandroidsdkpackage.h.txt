**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe code appears to be related to Android SDK package management and does not handle any sensitive data or perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities. It primarily focuses on parsing output from Android SDK tools, manipulating package information, and providing a way to manage and interact with Android SDK packages.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the security of any software system depends on the proper use and configuration of its components, as well as the overall security practices followed during development and deployment.
