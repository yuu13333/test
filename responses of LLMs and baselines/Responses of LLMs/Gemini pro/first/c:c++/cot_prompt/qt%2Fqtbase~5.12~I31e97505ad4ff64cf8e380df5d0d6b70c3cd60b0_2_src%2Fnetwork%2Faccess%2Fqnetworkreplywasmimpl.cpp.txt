No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code uses `emscripten` to make asynchronous HTTP requests using the Fetch API.\nThe code is careful to check the status code of the response and only parse the response body if the status code is less than 400.\nThis helps to prevent potential attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\nAdditionally, the code does not use any potentially dangerous functions or libraries.
