**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security defects. It uses the Qt framework's built-in data structures and functions to manipulate ASN.1 elements, which are commonly used in cryptographic operations. The code also performs basic input validation to ensure that the ASN.1 elements are not too large.
