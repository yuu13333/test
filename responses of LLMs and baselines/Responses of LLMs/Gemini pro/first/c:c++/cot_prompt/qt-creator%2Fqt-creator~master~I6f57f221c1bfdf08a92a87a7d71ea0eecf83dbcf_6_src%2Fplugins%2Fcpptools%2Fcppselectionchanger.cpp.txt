No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code uses Qt's `QTextCursor` class to manipulate the text cursor, which does not introduce any security risks. The code also uses Qt's `QObject` class to handle signals and slots, which is also considered secure. Additionally, the code does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities, such as executing external commands or accessing sensitive data.\n\nHere is a more detailed analysis of potential security defects:\n\n* **Line 39:** The code uses a constant `kChangeSelectionNodeIndexNotSet` to indicate that the change selection node index is not set. This constant is not properly initialized and is set to `-1`. It is recommended to explicitly initialize the constant to a value that is not a valid node index, such as `std::numeric_limits<int>::min()`.\n* **Line 40:** The code uses a constant `kChangeSelectionNodeIndexWholeDocoument` to indicate that the whole document is selected. This constant is not properly initialized and is set to `-2`. It is recommended to explicitly initialize the constant to a value that is not a valid node index, such as `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()`.\n* **Line 46:** The code uses a constant `kChangeSelectionNodeIndexNotSet` to indicate that the change selection node index is not set. This constant is not properly initialized and is set to `-1`. It is recommended to explicitly initialize the constant to a value that is not a valid node index, such as `std::numeric_limits<int>::min()`.\n\nThese issues are minor and do not pose a security risk. However, it is good practice to explicitly initialize constants to avoid potential errors.
