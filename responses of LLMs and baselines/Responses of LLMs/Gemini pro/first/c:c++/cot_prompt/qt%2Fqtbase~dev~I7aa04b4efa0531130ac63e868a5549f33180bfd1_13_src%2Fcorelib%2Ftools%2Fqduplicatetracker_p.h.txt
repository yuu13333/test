**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe code is a header file that contains the implementation of the `QDuplicateTracker` class, which is used to keep track of seen values of a given type.\nThe implementation uses either a `std::unordered_set` or a `QSet`, depending on whether the `__cpp_lib_memory_resource` feature is available.\nThe code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security defects.
