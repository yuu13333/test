**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe provided code appears to be related to 3D modeling and manipulation within the Qt framework, specifically for the QmlDesigner tool. It primarily consists of helper functions for handling various aspects of 3D editing, such as camera manipulation, node selection, and gizmo positioning. The code does not appear to have any direct security implications or handle sensitive data, so it is unlikely to introduce security risks in its intended usage context.\n\nIt's important to note that this analysis is limited to the provided code snippet and does not consider the broader context of the application or any other integrated components. The security of a software system depends on various factors, including the overall design, implementation, and deployment practices. Therefore, a comprehensive security assessment should consider all aspects of the system to identify potential vulnerabilities or risks.
