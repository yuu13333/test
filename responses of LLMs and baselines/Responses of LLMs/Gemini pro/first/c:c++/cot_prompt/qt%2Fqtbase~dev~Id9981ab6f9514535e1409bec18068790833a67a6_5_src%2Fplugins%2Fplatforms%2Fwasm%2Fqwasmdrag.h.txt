No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code is related to drag and drop functionality in Qt for WebAssembly. It defines a new class `QWasmDrag` and integrates it with the existing drag and drop infrastructure in Qt. The code also defines JavaScript functions that are exported to the web page to handle drag and drop events.\n\nI have reviewed the code and found that it follows good security practices. It does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, memory leaks, or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The code also properly handles user input and does not allow untrusted data to be executed.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be secure and does not pose any immediate security risks.
