**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe provided code adds `toSizeF()` and `toPointF()` methods to the `QSize` and `QPoint` classes, respectively. These methods simply convert the existing data in the `QSize` or `QPoint` object to a `QSizeF` or `QPointF` object. There is no user input or data validation involved, so there is no opportunity for a security defect.\n\nAdditionally, the code is properly encapsulated within the `QtCore` namespace, and all symbols are properly declared with the `Q_CORE_EXPORT` macro, ensuring that they are only accessible to other parts of the Qt framework.
