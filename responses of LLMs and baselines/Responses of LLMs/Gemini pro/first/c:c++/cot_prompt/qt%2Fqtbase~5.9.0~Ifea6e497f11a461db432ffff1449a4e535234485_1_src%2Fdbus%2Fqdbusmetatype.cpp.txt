Since I do not have access to the original code or the modified code, I cannot analyze it for security defects. Therefore, I cannot provide any information about potential security issues or suggest solutions.\n\nIf you would like me to analyze code for security defects in the future, you can provide me with the code directly or a link to the code repository. I can then use my knowledge of common security vulnerabilities and best practices to identify potential issues and suggest ways to mitigate them.
