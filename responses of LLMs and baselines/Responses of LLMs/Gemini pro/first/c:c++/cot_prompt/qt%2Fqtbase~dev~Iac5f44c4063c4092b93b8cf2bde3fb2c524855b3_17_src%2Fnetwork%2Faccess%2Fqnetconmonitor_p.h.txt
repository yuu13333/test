No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code introduces new private classes, `QNetworkConnectionMonitor` and `QNetworkStatusMonitor`, to replace the broken session management and bearer manager on macOS/iOS. These classes use the SystemConfiguration framework, specifically the `SCNetworkReachability` part, to monitor network connections and status.\n\nThe code appears to be well-written and follows secure coding practices. It uses the `Q_DECLARE_LOGGING_CATEGORY` macro to create a logging category for the classes, which allows for easy logging of events and errors.\n\nOverall, the code does not contain any apparent security defects.
