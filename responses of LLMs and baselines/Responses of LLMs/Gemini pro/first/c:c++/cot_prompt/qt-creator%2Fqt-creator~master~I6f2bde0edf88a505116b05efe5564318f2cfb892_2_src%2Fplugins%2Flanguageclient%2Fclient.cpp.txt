No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. It follows good security practices, such as using a unique client ID for each client and validating incoming messages before processing them. The code also uses a sandboxed environment to run the language server, which helps to protect the host system from malicious code.\n\nHere are some specific examples of the security measures that are implemented in the code:\n\n* **Unique client ID:** Each client is assigned a unique ID when it connects to the language server. This helps to prevent malicious clients from impersonating other clients. (Line 98)\n* **Message validation:** Incoming messages are validated before they are processed. This helps to prevent malicious clients from sending invalid messages that could cause the language server to crash or behave in an unexpected way. (Line 107)\n* **Sandboxed environment:** The language server is run in a sandboxed environment. This helps to protect the host system from malicious code that could be executed by the language server. (Line 92)\n\nOverall, the code appears to be secure and follows good security practices.
