1. CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal:
   Line 85: The code uses offScreenSurface.setFormat(m_context->format()) without checking the format for malicious input. This could allow an attacker to traverse the file system and access sensitive files.
  Recommendation:
   Validate the format before setting it to ensure it does not contain malicious input.

2. CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow:
   Line 236: The code uses blit() without checking the targetGeometry for overflow. This could lead to a stack-based buffer overflow if targetGeometry is not properly validated.
  Recommendation:
   Check the size of targetGeometry before using it in blit() to prevent a stack-based buffer overflow.

3. CWE-284: Improper Access Control:
   Line 401: The code uses deliverUpdateRequest without validating if the updateType is valid. This could lead to improper access control if an attacker sends an invalid updateType.
  Recommendation:
   Validate the updateType before using it in deliverUpdateRequest to prevent improper access control.

4. CWE-789: Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:
   Line 494: The code uses QOpenGLTexture::Create() without checking for memory allocation errors. This could lead to uncontrolled memory allocation if the texture allocation fails.
  Recommendation:
   Check for memory allocation errors after calling QOpenGLTexture::Create() to prevent uncontrolled memory allocation.
