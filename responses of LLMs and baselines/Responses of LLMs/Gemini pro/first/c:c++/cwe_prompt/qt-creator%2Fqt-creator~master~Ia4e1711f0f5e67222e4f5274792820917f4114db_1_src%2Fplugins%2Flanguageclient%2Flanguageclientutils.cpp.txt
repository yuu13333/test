**CWE-117: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts**
**Line number**: 85

*Description:*
The code directly accesses a text document at a given file path without requiring user authentication. This security vulnerability allows an attacker to access and potentially modify files on the system without authorization.

*Solution:*
Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to files based on user permissions. Consider using access control lists (ACLs) or other security mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify files.


**CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**
**Line number**: 226

*Description:*
The code creates a new QMenu object and adds actions to it without properly sanitizing or encoding user input. This makes the application vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the menu, which can be executed when the user opens the menu.

*Solution:*
Implement proper input validation and encoding mechanisms to prevent the execution of malicious code. Consider using HTML encoding or other sanitization techniques to ensure that user input is rendered as harmless text without executing any code.
