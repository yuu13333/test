**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**

* Line 165: The `cleanupPage()` method does not properly validate user input before using it. This could allow an attacker to provide malicious input that could be executed by the application.

**Solution:**

```cpp
void JsonSummaryPage::cleanupPage()
{
    if (!validatePage())
    {
        return;
    }

    disconnect(m_wizard, &JsonWizard::filesReady, this, nullptr);
}
```

**CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**

* Line 193: The `addSubProject()` method does not properly validate the `generatedProject` path before using it. This could allow an attacker to provide a malicious path that could be executed by the application.

**Solution:**

```cpp
if (!static_cast<ProjectNode *>(folder)->addSubProject(QDir::cleanPath(generatedProject))) {
    ...
}
```

**CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page**

* Line 210: The `QMessageBox::critical()` method does not properly neutralize HTML tags in the `nativeFilePaths` string before displaying it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML into the message box, which could be executed by the user.

**Solution:**

```cpp
QMessageBox::critical(wizard(), tr("Failed to Add to Project"),
                      tr("Failed to add one or more files to project\n\"%1\" (%2).")
                      .arg(folder->filePath().toUserOutput(),
                           Qt::escape(nativeFilePaths.join(QLatin1String(", ")))));
```
