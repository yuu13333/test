1. **CWE-761: Freeing Memory not on the Heap (Double Free)**

   - **Description:** This occurs when a program frees memory that has already been freed, which can lead to undefined behavior and program crashes.
   - **Code:** Line 103
   - **Solution:** Use a smart pointer or ensure that the memory is only freed once.

2. **CWE-789: Uncontrolled Memory Allocation (Use-After-Free)** 

   - **Description:** This occurs when a program uses memory after it has been freed, which can lead to undefined behavior and program crashes.
   - **Code:** Line 114
   - **Solution:** Ensure that memory is only used while it is valid and is not freed until it is no longer needed.

3. **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation** 

   - **Description:** This occurs when a program does not properly validate user input, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, SQL injection, and other security vulnerabilities.
   - **Code:** Lines 94, 110 
   - **Solution:** Implement proper input validation to ensure that user input is safe before using it.

4. **CWE-390: Inter-process Communication Errors (IPC) - Insufficient Information Flow Control** 

   - **Description:** This occurs when a program does not properly control the flow of information between processes, which can lead to data leakage or unauthorized access.
   - **Code:** Line 268
   - **Solution:** Ensure that inter-process communication is properly protected and that data is only shared with authorized processes.

5. **CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition** 

   - **Description:** This occurs when a program checks a condition and then performs an action based on that condition, but the condition may have changed between the check and the action, leading to incorrect behavior.
   - **Code:** Line 270
   - **Solution:** Ensure that the condition is checked again just before the action is performed to mitigate the risk of a race condition.
