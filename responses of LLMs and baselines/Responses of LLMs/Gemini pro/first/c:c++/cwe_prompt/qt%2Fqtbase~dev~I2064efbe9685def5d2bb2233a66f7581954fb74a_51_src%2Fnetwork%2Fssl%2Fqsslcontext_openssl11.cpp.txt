The following security defect is detected in the code:

* **CWE-362: Excessive Information Leakage** 

   - **Description:** This weakness occurs when a function or object returns or exposes more information than is required. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized users.

   - **Line Number:** 55 to 277

   - **Solution:** The code at line 265 can be improved by logging the error instead of returning it. This will prevent the error from being exposed to the user and will help to protect the application from unauthorized access.

Here is the improved version of the code:

```cpp
if (!q_SSL_CTX_ctrl(sslContext->ctx,
                             SSL_CTRL_SET_CURVES,
                             qcurves.size(),
                             const_cast<int *>(reinterpret_cast<const int *>(qcurves.data())))) {
    qWarning() << "Error setting elliptic curves:" << QSslSocketBackendPrivate::getErrorsFromOpenSsl();
}
```

With this change, the error will be logged instead of being returned, which will help to protect the application from unauthorized access.
