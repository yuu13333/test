**CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Input Validation)**

**Line Number**: 103

**Description**: The code executes a command line using the `emrunCommand` function, which constructs a command line based on user input. This command line is then used to launch the "emrun" tool, which runs a web assembly application. The value of the `html` variable is derived from user input and is not properly validated before being used to construct the command line. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML tags into the command line, which could be executed when the "emrun" tool is launched.

**Solution**: The code should properly validate the value of the `html` variable before using it to construct the command line. For example, it could use a regular expression to ensure that the value does not contain any malicious HTML tags.

Here is a modified version of the code that addresses the security defect:

```
47     auto html = bc->buildDirectory().pathAppended(target->project()->displayName() + ".html");

48     // Validate the HTML file name to prevent malicious HTML tags injection
49     if (!isValidHtmlFileName(html.fileName().toHtmlEscaped())) {
50         // Display an error message and return
51         return CommandLine();
52     }

53     return CommandLine(bc->environment().searchInPath("python"), {
54             emrunScript.absolutePath() + "/" + emrunScript.baseName() + ".py",
55             "--browser", browser,
56             "--port", port,
57             "--no_emrun_detect",
58             html.toString()
59         });
```

The `isValidHtmlFileName()` function checks the file name of the HTML file to ensure that it does not contain any malicious HTML tags. If the file name is invalid, the function returns `false`, and the command line is not constructed. This helps to prevent malicious HTML tags from being injected into the command line and executed.
