**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)**

* Line 119: The item is popped from the resources_copy list without first checking if the list is empty. If resources_copy is empty, this will result in an IndexError.

**Solution:** Add a check to ensure that resources_copy is not empty before attempting to pop an item from it.

```
if resources_copy:
    item = resources_copy.pop()
else:
    # Handle the case where resources_copy is empty
```
