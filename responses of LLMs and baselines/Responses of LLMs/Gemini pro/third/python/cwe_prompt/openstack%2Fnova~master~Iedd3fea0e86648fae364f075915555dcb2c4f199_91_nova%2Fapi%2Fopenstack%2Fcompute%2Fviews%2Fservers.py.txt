1. **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**
   - **Line 250:** The `project` and `host` variables are concatenated and hashed to generate a host ID. This operation does not validate the input and could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the input is malicious.
   - **Solution:** Use a secure hashing function like HMAC or bcrypt that takes a salt as input to prevent tampering.

2. **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**
   - **Line 341:** The `fault` dictionary contains user-supplied data (the fault message) that is directly included in the response without proper escaping or validation. This could potentially lead to cross-site scripting attacks.
   - **Solution:** Escape the fault message or use a templating engine that automatically escapes user input.

3. **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('OS Command Injection')**
   - **Line 178:** The code attempts to load trusted image certificates from the `instance.trusted_certs` attribute, but it does not properly validate or sanitize the certificate IDs before using them. This could potentially lead to arbitrary command execution if the certificate IDs are malicious.
   - **Solution:** Validate and sanitize the certificate IDs before using them to prevent command injection attacks.
