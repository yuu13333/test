**CWE-399: Resource Injection**

The code is vulnerable to resource injection because it allows the caller to specify the device addresses for vGPUs. This could allow an attacker to specify a malicious device address that could be used to gain access to the system.

**Solution:**

Validate the device addresses to ensure that they are valid and do not allow access to unauthorized resources.

**Line 275:**

**CWE-253: Observation of Resource Consumption**

The code is vulnerable to resource consumption observation because it allows the caller to determine which physical GPU is being used for a given vGPU. This could allow an attacker to identify and target specific physical GPUs for attack.

**Solution:**

Remove the ability to determine which physical GPU is being used for a given vGPU.
