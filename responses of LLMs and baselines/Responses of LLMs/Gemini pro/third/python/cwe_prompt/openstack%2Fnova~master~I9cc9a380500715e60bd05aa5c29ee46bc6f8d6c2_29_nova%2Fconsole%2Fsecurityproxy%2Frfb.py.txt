**CWE-134 (Uncontrolled Format String)**

CWE-134 occurs when format strings are not properly controlled and can be influenced by an attacker. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or a denial of service.

In the code, the following line is vulnerable to CWE-134:

```python
reason = _("Only the security type None (%d) is supported") % auth.AuthType.NONE
```

This line uses a format string to generate an error message. However, the format string is not properly controlled and can be influenced by an attacker. An attacker could craft a specially crafted message that would cause the code to execute arbitrary code or crash.

**Solution:**

The format string should be properly controlled to prevent an attacker from influencing the message that is generated. One way to do this is to use the `str.format()` method, which takes a list of arguments that are inserted into the format string. For example, the following code would be safe from CWE-134:

```python
reason = _("Only the security type None is supported").format(auth.AuthType.NONE)
```

**No other security defects are detected in the code.**
