**CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type**
* **CWE Definition**: Failure to restrict uploading files that the application cannot process, including those with executable content that will execute when accessed by an unsuspecting user.
* **Line Number**: 24
* **Description**: The function `importutils.import_module` is used to import the module `neutron.services.logapi.common.sg_validate`. However, this does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, and an attacker could upload a file with a dangerous type that the application cannot process.
* **Solution**: Restrict the types of files that can be uploaded by using a whitelist of allowed file types.

**CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**
* **CWE Definition**: Failure to neutralize or incorrectly neutralizing user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used in a web page.
* **Line Number**: 105
* **Description**: The function `ovn_nb.meter_add` is used to add a new meter to the OVN database. However, the `name` parameter is not properly neutralized, and an attacker could provide a value that includes malicious JavaScript. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's browser.
* **Solution**: Properly neutralize the `name` parameter by escaping any special characters.

**CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page**
* **CWE Definition**: Failure to neutralize or incorrectly neutralizing user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used in a web page.
* **Line Number**: 105
* **Description**: The function `ovn_nb.meter_add` is used to add a new meter to the OVN database. However, the `name` parameter is not properly neutralized, and an attacker could provide a value that includes malicious HTML tags. This could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary HTML into the web page.
* **Solution**: Properly neutralize the `name` parameter by escaping any special characters.
