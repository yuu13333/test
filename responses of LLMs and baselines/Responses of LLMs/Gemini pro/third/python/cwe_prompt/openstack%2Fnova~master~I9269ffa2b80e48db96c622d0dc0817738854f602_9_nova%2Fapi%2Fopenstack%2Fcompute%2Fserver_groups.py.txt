**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20)

**Affected line:** 134
**Description:** The code is not validating the `name` attribute of the `sg` object before assigning it. This could allow an attacker to provide a value that is not allowed by the system, potentially leading to an error or compromise.
**Solution:** Add input validation for the `name` attribute, such as checking that it is not empty or does not contain invalid characters.

**CWE-200: Information Exposure** (CWE-200)

**Affected line:** 54
**Description:** The code is exposing the group's `name` attribute in the response. This could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information, such as the name of the group or the group's purpose.
**Solution:** Remove the `name` attribute from the response, or only expose it to authorized users.

**CWE-250: Execution with Unrestricted Privileges** (CWE-250)

**Affected line:** 39
**Description:** The code is not properly validating the user's permissions before allowing them to access the `sg` object. This could allow an attacker to access the `sg` object with elevated privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
**Solution:** Add permission checks to the `_authorize_context` function to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the `sg` object.

**CWE-611: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** (CWE-611)

**Affected line:** 135
**Description:** The code is assigning the `policies` attribute of the `sg` object without checking the length of the `policies` list. This could allow an attacker to provide a list of policies that is too large, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue.
**Solution:** Add input validation to check the length of the `policies` list before assigning it to the `sg` object.
