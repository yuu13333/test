CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting')
The header of the incoming HTTP request is not validated, which makes it vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting. This may allow the attacker to inject newline characters to modify the message body of the HTTP response. It is recommended to validate the HTTP header to prevent this vulnerability.

```python
        compute_sock.sendall(struct.pack(
            '!I', AuthVeNCryptSubtype.X509NONE))
```

Solution:

```python
        compute_sock.sendall(struct.pack(
            '!I', str(AuthVeNCryptSubtype.X509NONE).encode()))
```
