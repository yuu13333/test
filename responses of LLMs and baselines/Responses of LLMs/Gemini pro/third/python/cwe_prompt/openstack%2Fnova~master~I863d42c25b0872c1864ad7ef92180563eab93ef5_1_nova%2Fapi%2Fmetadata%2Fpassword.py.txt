**CWE-310: Cryptographic Key Exposure**

This code stores passwords in system metadata without any encryption. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information if the system metadata is accessed by an unauthorized user.

**Affected Code:**

Line 46: `password = password or ''`
Line 51: `meta['password_%d' % i] = password[:CHUNK_LENGTH]`

**Solution:**

Encrypt the password before storing it in system metadata. Use a strong encryption algorithm like AES-256 with a secure key.

**CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**

This code does not check the length of the request body when handling POST requests. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack if the request body is too large.

**Affected Code:**

Line 67: `if (req.content_length > MAX_SIZE or len(req.body) > MAX_SIZE):`

**Solution:**

Check the length of the request body and raise an exception if it exceeds the maximum allowed size.
