**CWE-125: Out-of-Bounds Read**

Line 34: `MASK_30` is a 32-bit integer constant, but the expression `(snat_idx >> 30) ^ (snat_idx & MASK_30)` potentially shifts `snat_idx` by 32 bits, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.

**Solution:**

Ensure that the shift operation is performed within the bounds of the integer type. Consider using a bitwise AND operation with a mask to limit the shift amount, such as `(snat_idx >> (32 - 30)) & (snat_idx & MASK_30)`.
