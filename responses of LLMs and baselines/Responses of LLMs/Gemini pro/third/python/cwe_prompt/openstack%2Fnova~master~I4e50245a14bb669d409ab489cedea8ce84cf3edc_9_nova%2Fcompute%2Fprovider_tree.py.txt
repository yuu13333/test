There is one security defect detected in the code:

**CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**
**Line 13:** `uuidutils.generate_uuid()` generates version 4 UUIDs using os.urandom(), which can be vulnerable to prediction attacks if the operating system's random number generator is not secure. A cryptographically-secure random number generator should be used instead, such as the one provided by the `uuid` module.

**Solution:**
```python
import uuid

...

if uuid is None:
    uuid = uuid.uuid4()
```
