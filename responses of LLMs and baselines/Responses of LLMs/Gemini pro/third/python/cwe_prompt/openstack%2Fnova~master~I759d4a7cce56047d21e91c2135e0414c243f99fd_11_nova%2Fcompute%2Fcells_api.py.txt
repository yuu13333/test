CWE-20: Improper Input Validation CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')

- Line 167: The RPCClientCellsProxy class uses the target parameter, which is user-supplied, to create a proxy to the target RPC endpoint. This parameter is not validated or sanitized, which could allow an attacker to specify a malicious URL and redirect users to an untrusted site.
- Line 172: In the ComputeCellsAPI class, the _cast_to_cells method uses the instance parameter, which is also user-supplied, to cast a message to a specific cell. This parameter is not validated or sanitized, which could allow an attacker to specify a malicious cell and redirect the message to an unintended recipient.
- Line 235: In the _handle_cell_delete method, a variable called instance is used to access instance-related information. However, there is a potential race condition here, as the instance object may have been updated or deleted since it was originally retrieved. This could lead to incorrect or incomplete information being used in subsequent operations, potentially resulting in security vulnerabilities.

**Suggested Mitigations:**

- Line 167: Validate and sanitize the target parameter to ensure that it is a valid URL and not a malicious redirect.
- Line 172: Validate and sanitize the instance parameter to ensure that it is a valid cell name and not a malicious redirect.
- Line 235: Use a more robust mechanism to retrieve instance-related information, such as a database query or a lock to prevent race conditions.
