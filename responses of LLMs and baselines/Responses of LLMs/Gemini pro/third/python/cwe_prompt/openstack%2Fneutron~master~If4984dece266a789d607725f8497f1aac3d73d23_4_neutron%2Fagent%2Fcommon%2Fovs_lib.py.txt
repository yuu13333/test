**Security Defect 1**
* **CWE:** CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)
* **Location:** `_ovsdb_retry`
* **Description:** The `tenacity` library is used to retry operations that fail due to OVS not having yet assigned an ofport. However, if an exception is raised that is not related to ofport assignment, this function will not handle it correctly and may result in an infinite retry loop.
* **Recommendation:** Handle exceptions raised within `_ovsdb_retry` to ensure that the function behaves as expected and does not result in an infinite retry loop.

**Security Defect 2**
* **CWE:** CWE-390 (Detection of Error Condition Without Action)
* **Location:** `run_ofctl`
* **Description:** The `run_ofctl` function runs a command using the `subprocess` module, but does not properly handle exceptions that may be raised. Specifically, if a `subprocess.CalledProcessError` is raised, the function simply logs the error and does not provide any feedback to the caller.
* **Recommendation:** Handle `subprocess.CalledProcessError` exceptions within `run_ofctl` to ensure that the function provides feedback to the caller and does not silently fail.

**Security Defect 3**
* **CWE:** CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)
* **Location:** `delete_flows`
* **Description:** The `delete_flows` function does not properly handle the case where the `cookie` parameter is set to `COOKIE_ANY`. This value is intended to match flows regardless of their cookie, but the function does not handle the case where the `cookie_mask` parameter is also set, which could lead to unintended behavior.
* **Recommendation:** Handle the case where `cookie` is set to `COOKIE_ANY` and `cookie_mask` is also set within `delete_flows` to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

**Security Defect 4**
* **CWE:** CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)
* **Location:** `generate_random_cookie`
* **Description:** The `generate_random_cookie` function generates a random cookie using `random.randrange`, but does not properly handle the case where the generated cookie is `-1`. The OpenFlow specification forbids the use of `-1` as a cookie, so this function may generate invalid cookies that could lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Recommendation:** Handle the case where the generated cookie is `-1` within `generate_random_cookie` to ensure that the function generates valid cookies.
