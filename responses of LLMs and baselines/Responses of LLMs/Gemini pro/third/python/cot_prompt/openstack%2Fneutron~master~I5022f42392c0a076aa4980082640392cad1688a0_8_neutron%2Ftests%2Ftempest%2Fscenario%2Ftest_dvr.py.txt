**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThe code follows best practices for security by:\n\n* Using the `tempest.services.network.v2.router_client` client to interact with the Neutron API, which provides a secure and authenticated interface.\n* Using the `CONF` object to access configuration options, which are securely stored and managed.\n* Properly handling exceptions and errors to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage.\n* Using the `test_utils.wait_for_router_status` function to wait for the router to reach the desired state, preventing race conditions and ensuring that the tests are executed correctly.\n* Using the `check_gateway_removed` and `check_gateway_in_network` functions to verify that the gateway is properly removed and added to the network, ensuring that the network is configured correctly and securely.
