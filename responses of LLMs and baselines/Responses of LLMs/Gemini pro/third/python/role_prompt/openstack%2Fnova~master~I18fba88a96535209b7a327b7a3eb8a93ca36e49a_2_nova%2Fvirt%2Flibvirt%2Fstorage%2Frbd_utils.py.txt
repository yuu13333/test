There are two security defect found in the code:

1. **CWE-22: Improper Initialization**
   - **Description:** 
   The variable `features` is initialized to 0 if it is `None` or 0 in the function `RADOSClient.features`. This could cause incorrect behavior if the value of `features` is relied upon for security-critical decisions.
   - **Line Number(s):** 113-114
   - **Solution:**
   Initialize `features` to a default value that is appropriate for the application's security needs. For example, `features` could be initialized to a value that represents the most secure configuration.
2. **CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference**
   - **Description:** 
   The variable `vol` may be `None` in the function `RBDDriver.clone`. This could cause a NULL pointer dereference if `vol` is used without first checking for `None`.
   - **Line Number(s):** 236
   - **Solution:**
   Check that `vol` is not `None` before using it. For example, the following code checks for `None` before using `vol`:
   ```python
   if vol is not None:
       vol.clone(...)
   ```
