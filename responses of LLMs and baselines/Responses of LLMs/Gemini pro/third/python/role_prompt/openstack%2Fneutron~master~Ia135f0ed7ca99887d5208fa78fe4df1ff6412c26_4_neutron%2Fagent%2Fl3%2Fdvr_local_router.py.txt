**Line 328: Security Defect**
**Description:** The code executes a potentially harmful system command without proper validation or sanitization of the input. An attacker could provide a malicious command as input, which would be executed on the system, potentially leading to security breaches or system compromise.
**Solution:** Implement proper input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent the execution of malicious commands. For example, use a whitelist of allowed commands or validate the input against a set of predefined patterns to ensure that it does not contain potentially harmful characters or sequences.

**Line 336: Security Defect**
**Description:** The code uses a potentially unsafe string interpolation method to construct a system command. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker could provide a malicious string that is interpolated into the command, potentially leading to security breaches or system compromise.
**Solution:** Use a secure string interpolation method that prevents command injection vulnerabilities. For example, use the `subprocess.Popen` function with the `shell=False` argument to execute the command without interpolating the input string into the shell.
