1. **Line 198:** The `_gateway_added` function does not handle the case where the gateway interface is already present in the namespace. This could lead to duplicate gateway interfaces being created, which can cause network connectivity issues. To resolve this issue, the function should check if the gateway interface already exists before creating it.
2. **Line 202:** The `get_gateway_ips` function does not check if the `gateway_ip` field is present in the subnet. This can lead to errors if the subnet does not have a gateway configured. To resolve this issue, the function should check if the `gateway_ip` field is present before returning its value.
3. **Line 214:** The `_check_for_gateway_ip_change` function does not handle the case where the new agent gateway port is None. This can lead to an AttributeError being raised. To resolve this issue, the function should check if the new agent gateway port is None before comparing its IP addresses with the old agent gateway port.
4. **Line 227:** The `_add_default_gateway_for_fip` function does not check if the `tbl_index` parameter is None. This can lead to an IndexError being raised if the `tbl_index` parameter is not provided. To resolve this issue, the function should check if the `tbl_index` parameter is None before using it.
5. **Line 238:** The `_add_rtr_ext_route_rule_to_route_table` function does not check if the `fip_2_rtr` parameter is None. This can lead to an AttributeError being raised if the `fip_2_rtr` parameter is not provided. To resolve this issue, the function should check if the `fip_2_rtr` parameter is None before using it.
6. **Line 254:** The `check_agent_gateway_port_and_update_if_changed` function does not handle the case where the agent gateway port is None. This can lead to an AttributeError being raised. To resolve this issue, the function should check if the agent gateway port is None before comparing its IP addresses with the old agent gateway port.
7. **Line 262:** The `update_gateway_route` function does not check if the `tbl_index` parameter is None. This can lead to an IndexError being raised if the `tbl_index` parameter is not provided. To resolve this issue, the function should check if the `tbl_index` parameter is None before using it.
8. **Line 286:** The `_add_cidr_to_device` function does not check if the `device` parameter is None. This can lead to an AttributeError being raised if the `device` parameter is not provided. To resolve this issue, the function should check if the `device` parameter is None before using it.
9. **Line 290:** The `create_rtr_2_fip_link` function does not check if the `ri` parameter is None. This can lead to an AttributeError being raised if the `ri` parameter is not provided. To resolve this issue, the function should check if the `ri` parameter is None before using it.
