**ResourceRequest.from_extra_specs**: This method does not sanitize the input extra_specs, which could potentially contain malicious data. An attacker could provide crafted extra_specs to cause the scheduler to request invalid or excessive resources, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or service disruption.

**Solution**: Implement input validation for extra_specs to ensure that they conform to the expected format and contain valid values.
