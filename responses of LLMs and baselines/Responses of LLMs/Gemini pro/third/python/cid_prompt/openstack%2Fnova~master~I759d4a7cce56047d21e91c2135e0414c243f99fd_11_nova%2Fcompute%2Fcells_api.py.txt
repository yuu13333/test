1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

**Details:**

**Line 531:**
```python
def _assert_host_exists(self, context, host_name, must_be_up=False):
    """Cannot check this in API cell.  This will be checked in the
    target child cell.
    """
    pass
```

**CWE-284, CWE-693, CWE-697**
The `_assert_host_exists` method does not perform any host existence checks in the API cell. This could allow an attacker to exploit this behavior by sending requests to a non-existent host.

**Solution:**
Perform the necessary host existence checks in the API cell.

**Line 543:**
```python
try:
    result = super(HostAPI, self).set_host_enabled(context, host_name,
        enabled)
except exception.CellRoutingInconsistency:
    raise exception.HostNotFound(host=host_name)
```

**CWE-703**
The `set_host_enabled` method does not handle `CellRoutingInconsistency` exceptions gracefully. This could lead to the method failing silently, which could be exploited by an attacker.

**Solution:**
Handle the `CellRoutingInconsistency` exception and raise a more appropriate exception, such as `HostNotFound`.

**Line 551:**
```python
try:
    result = super(HostAPI, self).host_power_action(context, host_name,
        action)
except exception.CellRoutingInconsistency:
    raise exception.HostNotFound(host=host_name)
```

**CWE-703**
The `host_power_action` method does not handle `CellRoutingInconsistency` exceptions gracefully. This could lead to the method failing silently, which could be exploited by an attacker.

**Solution:**
Handle the `CellRoutingInconsistency` exception and raise a more appropriate exception, such as `HostNotFound`.

**Line 609:**
```python
try:
    return self.cells_rpcapi.service_get_by_compute_host(context,
        host_name)
except exception.CellRoutingInconsistency:
    raise exception.ComputeHostNotFound(host=host_name)
```

**CWE-703**
The `service_get_by_compute_host` method does not handle `CellRoutingInconsistency` exceptions gracefully. This could lead to the method failing silently, which could be exploited by an attacker.

**Solution:**
Handle the `CellRoutingInconsistency` exception and raise a more appropriate exception, such as `ComputeHostNotFound`.

**Line 672:**
```python
def compute_node_search_by_hypervisor(self, context, hypervisor_match):
    return self.cells_rpcapi.compute_node_get_all(context,
            hypervisor_match=hypervisor_match)
```

**CWE-710**
The `compute_node_search_by_hypervisor` method overrides the parent method without calling the parent method. This could lead to missing or incorrect functionality.

**Solution:**
Call the parent method before performing additional actions.
