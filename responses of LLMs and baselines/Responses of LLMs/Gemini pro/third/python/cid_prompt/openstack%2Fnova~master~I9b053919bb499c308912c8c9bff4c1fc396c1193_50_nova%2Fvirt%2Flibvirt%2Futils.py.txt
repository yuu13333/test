The following security defects are detected in the code:
1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
   - In get_disk_size function, it opens the given path to an image file for reading without proper access control checks, making the system vulnerable to unauthorized access. (line 242)
   - In get_disk_backing_file function, it opens the given path to an image file for reading without proper access control checks, making the system vulnerable to unauthorized access. (line 255)

2. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
   - In get_machine_type function, it does not consider the possibility of the image metadata not having the 'hw_machine_type' property as None, which could lead to incorrect machine type configuration. (line 602)

3. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
   - In create_ploop_image function, it does not check if the specified file system type is supported, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. (line 162)

4. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
   - In get_disk_size function, it does not properly neutralize the input 'path' before using it to open a file, making the system vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. (line 242)
   - In get_disk_backing_file function, it does not properly neutralize the input 'path' before using it to open a file, making the system vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. (line 255)

5. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)
   - The code does not adhere to the specified coding standards for security, such as input validation and error handling.

To address these defects, the code should be modified as follows:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
   - Add proper access control checks to the get_disk_size function. (line 242)
   - Add proper access control checks to the get_disk_backing_file function. (line 255)

2. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)
   - Check if the image metadata has the 'hw_machine_type' property and raise an appropriate error if not. (line 602)

3. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
   - Check if the specified file system type is supported in the create_ploop_image function and raise an appropriate error if not. (line 162)

4. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
   - Properly neutralize the input 'path' before using it to open a file in the get_disk_size function. (line 242)
   - Properly neutralize the input 'path' before using it to open a file in the get_disk_backing_file function. (line 255)

5. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)
   - Adhere to the specified coding standards for security, such as input validation and error handling.
