The following security defects are detected:

**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
Line 233: The code does not check if the user has the necessary permissions to delete the endpoint belonging to that host. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to delete endpoints without authorization.
Solution: Add a check to verify that the user has the necessary permissions to delete the endpoint.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
Line 241: The code does not check if the ip_endpoint object is None before deleting it. This could lead to an error if the ip_endpoint object does not exist.
Solution: Add a check to verify that the ip_endpoint object is not None before deleting it.
