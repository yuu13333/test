**CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards**

**Line: 92**

The code does not follow the recommended coding standards, such as the use of spaces instead of tabs, consistent indentation, and proper naming conventions.

**Solution:**

Refactor the code to adhere to the recommended coding standards.

**CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management**

**Line: 38-54**

The code lacks proper control flow management, making it susceptible to race conditions and unexpected behavior.

**Solution:**

Add proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, to prevent concurrent access to shared resources and ensure proper sequencing of operations.

**CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison**

**Line: 51, 52**

The code incorrectly compares `router.router_id` to a tuple, which can lead to unexpected results.

**Solution:**

Change the comparison to use the correct data types, such as comparing `router.router_id` to a string.

**CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**

**Line: 105-157**

The code does not handle exceptions properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior or system crashes.

**Solution:**

Add exception handling mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring that the system remains stable and operational.

**CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation**

**Line: 275**

The code incorrectly calculates the value of `expected_router_states`, leading to potential errors in the subsequent logic.

**Solution:**

Fix the calculation to accurately determine the expected router states.

**CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**

**Line: 161-165**

The code does not properly manage the lifetime of the `expected` variable, leading to potential memory leaks.

**Solution:**

Ensure that the `expected` variable is properly released or garbage collected when it is no longer needed.
