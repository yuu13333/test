The following security defects are detected:

**CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**

- Line 514-517: The code does not properly handle exceptions that may occur when updating the port. If an exception occurs, the code logs the error but does not take any further action, which could lead to the port not being updated correctly.

**CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison**

- Line 469: The code incorrectly compares the original VIF type to the new VIF type using the != operator, which is incorrect for this scenario. The correct operator to use is ==.
