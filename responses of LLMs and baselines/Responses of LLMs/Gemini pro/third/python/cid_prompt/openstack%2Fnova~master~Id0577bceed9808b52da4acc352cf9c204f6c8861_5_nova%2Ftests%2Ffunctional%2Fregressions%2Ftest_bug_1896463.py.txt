The code contains the following security defects:

**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):**

Defect Line: 124

Description: The function `_assert_pci_device_allocated` checks if a given number of PCI devices are allocated to an instance on a given host. However, it does not perform any access control checks to ensure that the caller is authorized to access the PCI device information. An attacker could exploit this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information about PCI devices.

Solution: Add access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can access PCI device information.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):**

Defect Line: 222

Description: The code checks if the PCI device is allocated on the compute1 host after the evacuation. However, it uses the wrong comparison operator (`==`) instead of the correct one (`!=`). This incorrect comparison may lead to incorrect results and could allow an attacker to bypass security checks.

Solution: Use the correct comparison operator (`!=`) to check if the PCI device is allocated on the compute1 host.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):**

Defect Line: 229

Description: The code includes a comment that states "FIXME(gibi): When this bug is fixed (or if you remove the sleeps above to avoid the race condition) then we expect that the PCI allocation exists on the destination host too." This comment indicates that the code is not handling the case where the PCI allocation does not exist on the destination host. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Solution: Add proper error handling to deal with the case where the PCI allocation does not exist on the destination host.
