The following security defects are detected in the code:

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
* **Line 114-152**: The `@utils.synchronized('connect_volume')` decorator is applied to the `connect_volume` and `disconnect_volume` methods. However, it is missing from the `_normalize_export` method, which is called by both of these methods. This means that the `_normalize_export` method could be called concurrently by multiple threads, which could lead to a race condition and unexpected behavior.
**Solution**: Add the `@utils.synchronized('connect_volume')` decorator to the `_normalize_export` method.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
* **Line 117**: The `self._normalize_export(data['export'])` expression assumes that the `export` key exists in the `data` dictionary. If the `export` key is not present, this expression will raise a `KeyError` exception.
**Solution**: Add a check to ensure that the `export` key is present in the `data` dictionary before calling `self._normalize_export`.

**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
* **Line 115**: The `connect_volume` method does not perform any access control checks before connecting the volume. This could allow an attacker to connect to any volume on the system, regardless of their permissions.
**Solution**: Add access control checks to the `connect_volume` method to ensure that only authorized users can connect to volumes.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
* **Line 148**: The `if libvirt_utils.is_mounted(mount_path, 'quobyte@' + quobyte_volume):` condition checks if the volume is mounted using the `quobyte@` protocol. However, the volume may be mounted using a different protocol, such as `nfs@`.
**Solution**: Use a more generic condition that checks if the volume is mounted regardless of the protocol.
