The following security defects are detected in the code:
1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** [Line 110-111]: The `create` method in `InstanceAction` allows users to create a new record without checking if an `id` already exists. This could lead to duplicate records or potential security risks.
2. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** [Line 265-266]: Similar to the previous defect, the `create` method in `InstanceActionEvent` fails to check for existing `id` values.
3. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** [Line 271-273]: The `create` method in `InstanceActionEvent` inserts a new record without first obtaining the parent `InstanceAction`'s `action_id`, which could lead to inconsistent data or security issues. Additionally, the `instance_uuid` and `request_id` should be validated to ensure they belong to the same action instance.
