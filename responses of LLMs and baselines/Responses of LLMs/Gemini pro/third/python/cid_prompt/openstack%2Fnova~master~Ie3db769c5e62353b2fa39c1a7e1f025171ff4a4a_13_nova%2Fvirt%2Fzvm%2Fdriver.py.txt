The following security defect is detected:
1. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)
   - Line 49: The '_init_' function of the 'ZVMDriver' class does not properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input, which could lead to a protection mechanism failure. Specifically, it does not verify that the 'cloud_connector_url' configuration parameter is a valid URL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an invalid URL, which could result in the driver failing to initialize and the host becoming unavailable to manage instances.
   - A fix for this defect could involve adding input validation and sanitization to the '_init_' function to ensure that the 'cloud_connector_url' parameter is a valid URL.
