1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - **Line 132:** The `_increment_consumer_generation` method increments the generation value for a consumer object, but does not perform any access control checks to ensure that the user making the request has the necessary permissions to modify the consumer's state. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to increment the generation value for a consumer object without authorization, potentially leading to a denial of service or other security issues.
   - **Solution:** Add access control checks to the `_increment_consumer_generation` method to ensure that the user making the request has the necessary permissions to modify the consumer's state.


2. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
   - **Line 193:** The `get_by_uuid` method retrieves a consumer object from the database based on a UUID, but does not properly neutralize the input before using it in a database query. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted UUID that contains malicious SQL code, which could be executed when the query is run.
   - **Solution:** Properly neutralize the UUID input before using it in the database query.


3. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
   - The code uses a mixture of snake_case and camelCase variable names, which violates the PEP8 coding style guidelines.
   - **Solution:** Enforce a consistent coding style throughout the codebase.
