**Identified Security Defects**
1. CWE-284: Improper Access Control (line 105)
CWE-284 relates to improper access control if the Ironic service does not have proper authentication implemented. This vulnerability could allow remote attackers to execute commands on the Ironic nodes. Access control checks should be implemented on the Ironic service to ensure that only authorized users can access the nodes.

2. CWE-435: Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities (line 105)
CWE-435 pertains to improper interaction between multiple entities. The Ironic service and the Compute Manager communicate with each other, and if there is improper validation or handling of messages between them, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. Proper validation and handling of messages should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability.

3. CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime (line 105)
CWE-664 relates to improper control of a resource through its lifetime. The Ironic service manages the lifecycle of bare metal nodes, and if there is improper handling of resources, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. Proper resource management should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability.

4. CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation (No Instances Detected)
CWE-682 highlights that no security defects were found in the code provided.

5. CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management (line 105)
CWE-691 pertains to insufficient control flow management. The Ironic service handles various operations, and if there is insufficient control flow management, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. Proper control flow management should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability.

6. CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure (line 105)
CWE-693 relates to protection mechanism failure. The Ironic service should implement proper protection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access or attacks. If there is a failure in these protection mechanisms, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. Proper protection mechanisms should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability.

7. CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison (line 105)
CWE-697 highlights that no security defects were found in the code provided.

8. CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions (line 105)
CWE-703 pertains to improper check or handling of exceptional conditions. The Ironic service should handle exceptional conditions gracefully. If there is improper handling of exceptional conditions, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. Proper handling of exceptional conditions should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability.

9. CWE-707: Improper Neutralization (No Instances Detected)
CWE-707 highlights that no security defects were found in the code provided.

10. CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards (line 105)
CWE-710 relates to improper adherence to coding standards. The Ironic service should adhere to secure coding standards. If there is improper adherence to coding standards, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. Proper coding standards should be followed to prevent this vulnerability.
