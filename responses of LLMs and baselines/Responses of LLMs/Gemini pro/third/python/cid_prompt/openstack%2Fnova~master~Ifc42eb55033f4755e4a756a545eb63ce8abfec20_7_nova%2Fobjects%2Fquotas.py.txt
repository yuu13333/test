1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**:
   - Line 26-35: This code snippet is responsible for determining the project ID and user ID of an instance.
   - However, it fails to properly check if the context object has the required permissions to access the instance's project and user information, leading to potential authorization issues where unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive data.
   - To resolve this issue, proper authorization checks should be implemented to ensure that the user has the necessary privileges to perform the requested operation.
2. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**:
   - Line 94-95: When the project ID is not found in the database, an exception is raised.
   - However, it is not properly handled, and the code continues execution without providing any feedback to the user or taking any corrective action, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential data loss.
   - To resolve this issue, proper exception handling should be implemented, such as logging the error and providing a meaningful error message to the user, ensuring that the application can gracefully handle such exceptional conditions.
