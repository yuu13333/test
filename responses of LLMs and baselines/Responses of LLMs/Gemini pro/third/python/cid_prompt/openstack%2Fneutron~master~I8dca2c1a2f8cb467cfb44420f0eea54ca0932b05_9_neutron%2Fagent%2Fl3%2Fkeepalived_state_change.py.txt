The following security defects are detected in the code:

1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**:
   - Line 130: The HTTP request is sent without any authentication or authorization checks. This could allow an attacker to send arbitrary requests to the neutron agent, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the network.
   - Solution: Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to the HTTP endpoint.

2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**:
   - Line 120: The state file is opened in write mode without specifying the encoding. This could lead to data corruption if the file contains non-UTF-8 characters.
   - Solution: Open the state file with the appropriate encoding to ensure that the data is handled correctly.

3. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**:
   - Line 140: The `send_ip_addr_adv_notif` function is called without checking if the IP address is valid. This could lead to the function being called with an invalid IP address, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.
   - Solution: Add checks to ensure that the IP address is valid before calling `send_ip_addr_adv_notif`.
