1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - Line 163: The `wait_for_read` method in `NamedPipe` class does not check if `_read_pending` is `False` before trying to wait for the event. This allows an attacker to call this method without first calling the `nonblocking_read` method, which could lead to a denial of service attack.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
   - Line 307: The `get_read_result` method in `NamedPipe` class does not check if `_read_pending` is `True` before trying to get the overlapped result. This could lead to a crash if the read operation has not completed yet.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - Line 218: The `blocking_write` method in `NamedPipe` class does not close the handle to the named pipe after writing. This could lead to a resource leak.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
   - Line 284: The `get_overlapped_result` method in `NamedPipe` class does not check if `nBytesRead` is less than zero before trying to use it to decode the result. This could lead to a crash if the read operation failed.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
   - Line 332: The `get_overlapped_result` method in `NamedPipe` class does not handle the case where the error code is not `ERROR_IO_INCOMPLETE`. This could lead to unexpected behavior.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
   - Line 203: The `blocking_write` method in `NamedPipe` class does not check if `_npipe_file` is `None` before trying to write to it. This could lead to a crash.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
   - Line 257: The `nonblocking_read` method in `NamedPipe` class does not check if `errCode` is equal to zero before trying to access `_read_buffer`. This could lead to a crash if the read operation failed.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
   - Line 190: The `create_file` method in `NamedPipe` class does not handle the case where the `create_file` function fails. This could lead to unexpected behavior.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
   - Line 211: The `blocking_write` method in `NamedPipe` class does not properly encode the input buffer before writing it to the named pipe. This could lead to a buffer overflow.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
    - Line 56, 80: The error message should be a format string instead of a fixed string.
    - Line 61, 81: The error message should be assigned to the `error_message` property instead of being printed.
    - Line 221: The error code should be compared to 0 instead of using the `==` operator.
    - Line 259: The error code should be compared to `ERROR_IO_PENDING` instead of using the `==` operator.
    - Line 333: The error code should be compared to `ERROR_IO_INCOMPLETE` instead of using the `==` operator.
