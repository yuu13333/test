**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
No security defects detected.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
No security defects detected.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
The temporary file is not properly handled in case of an exception.
```python
147             self.onEnter()

148             # prevent resources to be closed on normal exit and make them available
150             # inside __exit__()
151             self._resources = resources.pop_all()
152             return self
```
This code should be rewritten as follows:
```python
147             self.onEnter()

148             self._resources = resources.pop_all()
149             return self
```

No security defects detected.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
No security defects detected.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
The temporary file is not properly handled in case of an exception.
This code should be rewritten as follows:
```python
155         if exc_type is None:
156             with self._resources:
157                self.onExit()
158         else:
