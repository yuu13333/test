**1.CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
- **1. Line 79-80:** By default, the _addl_env_args_ function returns an empty list, which means any process created using the _create_process_ function will not have additional environment variables set. 

**2.CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
- **1. Line 91:** Security-sensitive functions (e.g. _execute_rootwrap_daemon_) can be called without proper validation or authorization checks, leading to potential privilege escalation or other security issues. 

**3.CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
- **1. Line 127:** The _obj_ object is not closed after the communication with the subprocess is complete. This can lead to resource leaks and potential security vulnerabilities.

**4.CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
- **1. Line 139:** The error message format string contains format specifiers that don't correspond to the supplied arguments. This can lead to incorrect or misleading error messages.

**5.CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
- **1. Line 153-155:** The code unnecessarily sleeps for a short amount of time after each subprocess call. This can introduce unnecessary delays and potential performance issues.

**6.CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
- **1. Line 170-171:** The code uses a hardcoded MAC address format when parsing the output of the fcntl.ioctl() call. This can lead to incorrect or incomplete MAC addresses being returned.

**7.CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
- **1. Line 302:** The _pid_invoked_with_cmdline_ function incorrectly checks for the equality of command lists instead of comparing their contents. This can lead to incorrect results and potential security vulnerabilities.

**8.CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
- **1. Line 264:** The code logs an error message when it encounters a ValueError while reading a file. However, it doesn't handle the exception properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

**9.CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
- **1. Line 313:** The _remove_abs_path_ function removes the absolute path from the first element of the command list. However, it doesn't neutralize the potential security risks associated with the remaining command arguments.

**10.CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
- **1. Line 62:** The __new__() method of the _RootwrapDaemonHelper_ class raises a _NotImplementedError_ without providing any explanation or guidance. This violates coding standards and makes it difficult for developers to understand the purpose of the class.
