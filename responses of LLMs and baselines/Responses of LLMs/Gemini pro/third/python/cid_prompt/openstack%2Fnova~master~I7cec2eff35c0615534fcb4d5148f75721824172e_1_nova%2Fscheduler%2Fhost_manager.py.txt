## Issues:
### Line 41: CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)
The code contains a typo: `users` instead of `user`.

### Line 139: CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
The `set_update_time_on_success` decorator ignores exceptions raised from `consume_from_request()`, which may lead to unexpected behavior. Consider handling exceptions appropriately.

### Line 281: CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)
The value of `num_instances` is incremented without checking if the value is already set, which may lead to incorrect counting. Consider using a lock or atomic increment to ensure thread safety.

### Line 499: CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
The `_load_cells` function does not handle exceptions that may occur during cell lookup, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Consider handling exceptions gracefully.

### Line 526: CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
The `host_state_map` is not cleared when the host is removed from the system, potentially leading to stale data. Consider clearing the host state map when the host is removed.

### Line 647: CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)
The `_get_host_states` function uses a generator to return `HostStates`, which is not idiomatic Python. Consider returning a list of `HostStates` instead.

### Line 674: CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
The `_get_host_states` function does not handle exceptions that may occur when retrieving a service record, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Consider handling exceptions gracefully.

### Line 765: CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
The `update_instance_info` method does not handle exceptions that may occur when updating the host info, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Consider handling exceptions gracefully.

### Line 790: CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)
The `delete_instance_info` method does not handle exceptions that may occur when deleting the instance info, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Consider handling exceptions gracefully.
