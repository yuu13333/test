The following security defects are found in the code:

1. **CWE-435: Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities** 
   - **Line 244:** The `Forbidden` exception is raised when a write permission check on the storage pool fails. However, the error message does not provide sufficient context about which storage pool the write permission check failed for, making it difficult to identify the affected pool.

2. **CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime** 
   - **Line 284:** The RBD volume is flattened without proper resource management. The `vol` variable is not closed before exiting the `with` block, potentially leaving the volume open and accessible to other processes.

3. **CWE-707: Improper Neutralization** 
   - **Line 371:** The `_cleanup_vol` function is called to clean up the volume. However, the `_cleanup_vol` function does not properly neutralize any potential vulnerabilities that may have been introduced by the volume, such as by sanitizing or securely erasing the data on the volume.

To address these security defects, the following changes should be made:

1. **CWE-435:** 
   - **Line 244:** Add the storage pool name to the `Forbidden` exception message to provide more context about the affected pool.

2. **CWE-664:** 
   - **Line 284:** Close the `vol` variable before exiting the `with` block to ensure that the volume is properly closed and inaccessible to other processes.

3. **CWE-707:** 
   - **Line 371:** Add a sanitization or secure erasure step to the `_cleanup_vol` function to neutralize any potential vulnerabilities that may have been introduced by the volume.
