The code has the following security defects:
1. Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime (CWE-664):
   - Line 121: The code uses a try-except block to update the port IP address.
     If the IP address is already allocated, the code ignores the error and
     continues attempting to update the port IP address. This can lead to
     a situation where the port IP address is changed without the proper
     authorization or notification.
2. Incorrect Comparison (CWE-697):
   - Line 109: The code compares the old gateway IP address (old_gw_ip) to
     the gateway IP address of the router (router['external_gateway_info']
     ['external_fixed_ips'][0]['ip_address']). However, the code does not
     check if the old gateway IP address is actually equal to the new gateway
     IP address. This can lead to a situation where the code incorrectly
     determines that the gateway IP address has changed.
