CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
Line 183: `instance.metadata` is being modified during the execution of `create` method. No proper control is being maintained over the usage of `instance.metadata` after this modification. This issue could lead to unintended behavior or data corruption.

Solution: Consider using a lock or other synchronization mechanism to control access to `instance.metadata`.

CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
Line 184: The value of `protocol` is being used as a key to retrieve a function from `self.handlers` dictionary. However, the value of `protocol` is not properly validated or neutralized before using it as a key. This issue could lead to an attacker injecting arbitrary code into the system.

Solution: Properly validate and neutralize the value of `protocol` before using it as a key to retrieve a function from `self.handlers` dictionary.
