**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
1. Line 35: `return self._weights.get(host_state.host, 0)`: The `get` method of a dictionary returns the value associated with the specified key. If the key is not found, it returns the default value specified in the second argument. In this case, if the `host_state.host` is not found in the `_weights` dictionary, it will return 0. This could lead to incorrect calculations if the weight for a host is expected to be non-zero but it is not present in the dictionary.
2. Line 34: `Any undefined host gets no weight.`: If a host is not found in the `_weights` dictionary, it will return a weight of 0. This could lead to incorrect calculations if the weight for a host is expected to be non-zero but it is not present in the dictionary.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
No defects found.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
No defects found.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
No defects found.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
1. Line 478: `with mock.patch.object(self.computes['host2'].driver, 'spawn',
side_effect=error):`: This code uses `mock.patch.object` to mock the `spawn` method of the `self.computes['host2'].driver` object. The `side_effect` parameter is used to specify a function that will be called when the mocked method is called. In this case, the `side_effect` parameter is set to the `error` variable, which is an instance of the `exception.HypervisorUnavailable` exception class. This means that when the `spawn` method is called, it will raise the `exception.HypervisorUnavailable` exception.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
No defects found.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
