**1. Improper Access Control (CWE-284):**
  - **Line 86:** The `get_conntack_helper` method does not perform any access control checks before returning the conntrack helper object. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive information about conntrack helpers that they should not have access to.
  - **Solution:** Add proper access control checks to the `get_conntack_helper` method to ensure that only authorized users can access conntrack helper objects.


**2. Incorrect Comparison (CWE-697):**
  - **Line 56:** The comparison `if (cth.id not in self._router_conntrack_helper_mapping[cth.router_id]):` is incorrect. The comparison should be `if (cth.id not in self._router_conntrack_helper_mapping.get(cth.router_id, set())):` to account for the case where the router does not have any conntrack helpers.
  - **Solution:** Change the comparison to `if (cth.id not in self._router_conntrack_helper_mapping.get(cth.router_id, set())):`.


**3. Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-703):**
  - **Line 79:** The `clear_by_router_id` method does not handle the case where the router ID does not exist in the `_router_conntrack_helper_mapping` dictionary. This could lead to an error being raised when the method is called.
  - **Solution:** Add a check to the `clear_by_router_id` method to handle the case where the router ID does not exist in the `_router_conntrack_helper_mapping` dictionary.


**4. Protection Mechanism Failure (CWE-693):**
  - **Line 111:** The `_handle_notification` method uses a `synchronized` lock to protect the shared data structures. However, the lock is not released after the method returns. This could lead to a deadlock if multiple threads attempt to access the shared data structures simultaneously.
  - **Solution:** Add a `finally` block to the `_handle_notification` method to ensure that the lock is always released, even if an exception is raised.


**5. Improper Adherence to Coding Standards (CWE-710):**
  - The code does not follow the PEP 8 style guide. For example, there are no blank lines between function definitions, and the indentation is inconsistent.
  - **Solution:** Refactor the code to follow the PEP 8 style guide.
