The following security defects are detected in the code:
* **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):** Line 93 may lead to an incorrect calculation of the number of servers to boot. The code uses `num_servers=2` as the argument to the `_boot_servers` function, which could result in creating more servers than intended. This could lead to resource exhaustion or other unintended consequences.
**Solution:** Change Line 93 to `num_servers=1` to ensure that only one server is booted.

* **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** Line 105 may fail to handle exceptions properly. The code calls the `post_server_action` method without catching any exceptions that may be raised. This could lead to the server not being migrated if an exception occurs.
**Solution:** Wrap the `post_server_action` call in a try/except block to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur.
