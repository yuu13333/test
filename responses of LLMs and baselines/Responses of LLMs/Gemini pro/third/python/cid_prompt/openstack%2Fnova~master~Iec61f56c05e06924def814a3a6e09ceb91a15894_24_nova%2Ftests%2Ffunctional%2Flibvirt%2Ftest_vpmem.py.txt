   - **Line 172:** The `_check_vpmem_allocations` function does not handle the case where the given vpmem allocations do not match the allocations for the given server ID. This can lead to the function failing silently.
   - **Solution:** Add a check to the function to handle the case where the given vpmem allocations do not match the allocations for the given server ID.

4. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
