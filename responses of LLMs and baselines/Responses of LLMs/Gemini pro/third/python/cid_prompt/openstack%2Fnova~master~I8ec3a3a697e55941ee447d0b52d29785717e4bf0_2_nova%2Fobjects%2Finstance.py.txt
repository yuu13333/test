1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): Instance attributes are adjusted or dropped by migration context
2. CWE-435 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer): This library attempts to prevent exceeding maximum tag count by using MAX_TAG_COUNT but the check is on the list object instead of the count
3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through Its Lifetime): Resource is accessed after it has been released
4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation): There is no error handling when calculating the loaded instance list size. When the list size exceeds the maximum, the program will crash with an IndexError
5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): This library can be instructed to skip cells_sync via skip_cells_sync but there isn't a corresponding function to restore the skip flag. If the instance is saved more than once while skip_cells_sync is enabled, the flag will be applied permanently
6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure): This library doesn't check the expected_attrs parameter of its get_by_filters method before passing it to db.instance_get_all_by_filters. If an attacker can set expected_attrs, they can use this to force a query to return back otherwise protected information
7. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): Instance object falsity is used as a sentinel indicating this is the first time the object has been loaded. However, this isn't always the case; if an object attribute is missing, this also evaluates to False
8. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): There is a KeyError when an instance fault isn't found and doesn't differentiate between a legitimate error and a filter parameter
9. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization): Instance object metadata could be updated or deleted via delete_metadata_key and isn't properly checked if it is writable
10. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards): Many functions fail to use the Contextlib context manager format
