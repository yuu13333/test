**Line 119:** A check should be made to see if the floating IP is intended for this host. If the floating IP is not destined for this agent and if the floating IP is configured in a different compute host, this should not happen once we fix the server side code. However, a check should still be done to make sure if the floating IP is intended for this host.

**Line 291:** The _process_arp_cache_for_internal_port function is called after the _update_arp_entry call. The logic of this function is to go ahead and add it to the remove set if the arp update was successful. If the arp update is successful, then the _process_arp_cache_for_internal_port function will be called to remove the entry from the pending arp set.

**Line 323:** In the _delete_gateway_device_if_exists function, if the device is not found, it will pass. This could potentially cause issues if the device is not found and the gateway is not deleted.

**Line 344:** In the _stale_ip_rule_cleanup function, the code flushes the routes for a table that is no longer in use. This could potentially cause issues if the table is still in use.

**Line 411:** In the _check_if_address_scopes_match function, the code checks if the address scope of the interface is none. If the address scope is none, then it returns False. This could potentially cause issues if the address scope is not none and the code returns False.

**Line 414:** In the _add_interface_routing_rule_to_router_ns function, the code adds a routing rule to the router namespace. If the rule is not added, this could potentially cause issues with routing.

**Line 420:** In the _snat_redirect_add_from_port function, the code checks if the address scope matches. If the address scopes match, there is no need to cleanup the snat redirect rules. However, the code does not check if the address scopes do not match, and this could potentially cause issues with the snat redirect rules.

**Line 718:** In the _check_if_route_applicable_to_fip_namespace function, the code checks if the nexthop is in the gateway subnet. If the nexthop is not in the gateway subnet, this could potentially cause issues with routing.
