**Description:** The initialization of `client` doesn't perform error handling, which can lead to exceptions being raised when attempting to access the Rados cluster.

**Solution:** Wrap the initialization of `client` in a try-except block to handle any errors that may occur.

```python
try:
    client = rados.Rados(rados_id=self.rbd_user,
                          conffile=self.ceph_conf)
except Exception as e:
    LOG.error(_('Error initializing RADOS client: %s'), e)
    raise RuntimeError(_('Error initializing RADOS client'))
```

### Line 133

**Description:** The connection to the Rados cluster is not being verified, which can lead to exceptions being raised when attempting to access the cluster.

**Solution:** Add a check to ensure that the connection to the Rados cluster was successful before proceeding.

```python
try:
    client.connect()
except Exception as e:
    LOG.error(_('Error connecting to RADOS cluster: %s'), e)
    raise RuntimeError(_('Error connecting to RADOS cluster'))
```

### Line 144

**Description:** The shutdown of the Rados client is not being performed, which can lead to resource leaks.

**Solution:** Ensure that the Rados client is properly shut down when it is no longer needed.

```python
finally:
    try:
        client.shutdown()
    except Exception as e:
        LOG.error(_('Error shutting down RADOS client: %s'), e)
```

### Line 220

**Description:** The `exists` method doesn't handle exceptions that may occur when attempting to open the RBD image.

**Solution:** Wrap the call to `RBDVolumeProxy` in a try-except block to handle any errors that may occur.

```python
try:
    with RBDVolumeProxy(self, image, pool=pool, snapshot=snapshot,
                       read_only=True) as vol:
        return True
except rbd.ImageNotFound:
    return False
except Exception as e:
    LOG.error(_('Error accessing RBD image: %s'), e)
    return False
```
