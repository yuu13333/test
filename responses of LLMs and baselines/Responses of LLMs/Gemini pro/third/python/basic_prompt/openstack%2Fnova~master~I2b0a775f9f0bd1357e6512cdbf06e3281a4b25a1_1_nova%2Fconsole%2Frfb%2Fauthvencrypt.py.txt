**Security Defect**: Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration - Using a Weak SSL/TLS Protocol Version

**Description**: The code uses `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` to establish the SSL/TLS connection. However, TLSv1.2 is no longer considered secure and should not be used in new applications. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in TLSv1.2 to compromise the connection and intercept sensitive data.

**Solution**: Upgrade to a more secure SSL/TLS protocol version, such as TLSv1.3.

### Updated Code:

```python
wrapped_sock = ssl.wrap_socket(
    compute_sock,
    keyfile=client_key,
    certfile=client_cert,
    server_side=False,
    cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_REQUIRED,
    ca_certs=CONF.vnc.vencrypt_ca_certs,
    ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_3)
```
