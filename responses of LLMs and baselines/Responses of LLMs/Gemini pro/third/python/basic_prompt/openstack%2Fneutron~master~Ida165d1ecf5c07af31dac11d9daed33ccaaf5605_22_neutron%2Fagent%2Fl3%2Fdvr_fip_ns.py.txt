There is a security defect in this code. On line 390, the code adds a CIDR to the fip_2_rtr_dev without checking if the CIDR is already present. This can lead to duplicate IP addresses being assigned to the device, which can cause network connectivity issues.

To fix this defect, the code should be modified to check if the CIDR is already present before adding it to the device. This can be done by using the following code:

```python
if not fip_2_rtr_dev.addr.list(to=str(fip_2_rtr)):
    fip_2_rtr_dev.addr.add(str(fip_2_rtr))
```
