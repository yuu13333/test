There is a potential security defect exists at Line 147 where code doesn't use the `check_exit_code=True` parameter of `execute` method to verify the command execution. If the execution fails, the exception will not be raised and the code will continue to the next line without handling the error. This could potentially lead to security issues if the command is not executed successfully.

A fix for this security defect would be to set `check_exit_code=True` when executing the command to ensure that an exception is raised if the command fails:

```python
ip_wrapper.netns.execute(['sysctl',
                                               '-w',
                                               'net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1'],
                                              log_fail_as_error=False,
                                              run_as_root=True,
                                              check_exit_code=True)
```
