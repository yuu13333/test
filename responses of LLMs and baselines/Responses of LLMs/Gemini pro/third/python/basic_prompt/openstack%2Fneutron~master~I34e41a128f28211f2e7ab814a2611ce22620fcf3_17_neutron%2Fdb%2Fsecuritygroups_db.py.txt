**Line 801:** The `_check_update_deletes_security_groups` method returns True if the port has a security group and its value is either an empty list or not set, otherwise False.

**Security Defect:** This method is used to determine if security groups are being removed from a port. However, it does not check for the case where the security group list is being set to None, which would also effectively remove all security groups from the port.

**Solution:** Modify the method to also check if the security group list is set to None:

```python
def _check_update_deletes_security_groups(self, port):
    """Return True if port has as a security group and it's value
    is either [] or not is_attr_set, otherwise return False
    """
    if (ext_sg.SECURITYGROUPS in port['port'] and
        (not validators.is_attr_set(
                port['port'][ext_sg.SECURITYGROUPS]) or
            port['port'][ext_sg.SECURITYGROUPS] is None or
            port['port'][ext_sg.SECURITYGROUPS] == [])):
        return True
    return False
```
