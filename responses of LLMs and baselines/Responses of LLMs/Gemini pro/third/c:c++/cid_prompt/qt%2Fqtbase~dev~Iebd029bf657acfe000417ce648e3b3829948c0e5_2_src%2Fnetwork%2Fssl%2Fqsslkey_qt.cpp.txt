1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
   - Line 656: The `pbes1OidHashFunctionMap` is hardcoded to no MD2 and no RC4. This can lead to improper access control if an attacker is able to use these algorithms to access sensitive data.
   - Line 677: The `pbes1OidHashFunctionMap` is incomplete and does not include all of the algorithms that are supported by PKCS12. This can lead to improper access control if an attacker is able to use one of these unsupported algorithms to access sensitive data.
2. **CWE-435 Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities**
   - Line 154-157: The `deriveAesKey` function modifies the `key` variable which may be used by other functions. This can lead to improper interaction between multiple entities if the value of `key` is not properly synchronized.
3. **CWE-664 Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**
   - Line 193-195: The `clear` function does not properly release all resources associated with the `QSslKeyPrivate` object. This can lead to improper control of a resource through its lifetime if the object is not properly destroyed.
4. **CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison**
   - Line 287-294: The `decryptPkcs8` function does not properly check the return value of the `elem.read` function. This can lead to an incorrect comparison if the function returns an error.
5. **CWE-710 Improper Adherence to Coding Standards**
   - Line 100-102: The `oidLengthMap` is defined using the `static const` keyword, which is not part of the C++ standard. This can lead to improper adherence to coding standards if the compiler does not support this keyword.
