**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
- Line 145: The \c dllexport macro is used to export functions from a DLL on Windows. This is necessary for the resolve() function to be able to resolve symbols in the library. However, the macro is not used in a way that is consistent with the rest of the code. In particular, the macro is used to export a function that is declared with an \c extern "C" block, but the function is not actually defined in the \c extern "C" block. This could lead to the function being exported with the wrong name, which could prevent the resolve() function from finding it.
- **Solution:** Move the \c dllexport macro to the beginning of the function declaration, so that it is applied to the function definition as well as the declaration.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
- None detected.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
- None detected.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
- None detected.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
- Line 146: The \c extern "C" block is not terminated with a semicolon. This is a violation of the C++ coding standards.
- **Solution:** Add a semicolon to the end of the \c extern "C" block.

**CWE-764 (Multiple Definitions)**
- None detected.
