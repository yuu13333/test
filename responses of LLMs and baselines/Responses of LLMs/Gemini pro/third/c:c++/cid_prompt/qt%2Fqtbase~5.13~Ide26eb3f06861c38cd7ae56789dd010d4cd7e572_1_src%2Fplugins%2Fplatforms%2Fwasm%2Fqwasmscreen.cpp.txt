**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**

**Line 111-112**
```cpp
 emscripten::val dpi = emscripten::val::module_property("qtFontDpi");
 if (!dpi.isUndefined()) {
```
This code is vulnerable to a protection mechanism failure because it relies on the presence of a specific module property ("qtFontDpi") to determine the logical DPI of the screen. If this property is not set or is set to an invalid value, the code will fail to obtain the correct DPI and may result in incorrect rendering or scaling of UI elements.

To fix this, the code should provide a fallback mechanism to determine the DPI if the "qtFontDpi" property is not available or is invalid. For example, it could use a default DPI value or read the DPI from the HTML window's "devicePixelRatio" property.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**

**Line 116-117**
```cpp
     const qreal defaultDpi = 96;
     return QDpi(defaultDpi, defaultDpi);
```
This code is vulnerable to an incorrect comparison because it assumes that the default DPI value (96) is always valid. However, in some cases, the default DPI may not be appropriate or may need to be adjusted based on the specific display configuration.

To fix this, the code should use a more robust method to determine the default DPI, such as reading it from the HTML window's "devicePixelRatio" property or using a platform-specific API to obtain the system's default DPI setting.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**

**Line 111-112**
```cpp
 emscripten::val dpi = emscripten::val::module_property("qtFontDpi");
 if (!dpi.isUndefined()) {
```
This code is vulnerable to improper handling of exceptional conditions because it does not handle the case where the module property ("qtFontDpi") is undefined. As a result, the code may fail to obtain the correct DPI and may result in incorrect rendering or scaling of UI elements.

To fix this, the code should check if the module property is undefined and handle this case appropriately, such as by using a fallback mechanism to determine the DPI or logging an error message.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

**Line 105-106**
```cpp
 QImage::Format QWasmScreen::format() const
 {
     return m_format;
 }
```
This code violates coding standards by not using a const reference to return the format. This can lead to subtle bugs if the format is modified after the function returns.

To fix this, the code should use a const reference to return the format, like this:

```cpp
 const QImage::Format& QWasmScreen::format() const
 {
     return m_format;
 }
```
