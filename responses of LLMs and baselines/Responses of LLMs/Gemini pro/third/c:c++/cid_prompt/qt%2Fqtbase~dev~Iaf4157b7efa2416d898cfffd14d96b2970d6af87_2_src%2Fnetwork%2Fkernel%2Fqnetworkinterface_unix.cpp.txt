The following security defects are detected:

1. Line 59: CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison
The code compares two variables of type `char *` without using the `strcmp` function or similar, which can lead to incorrect comparisons and potential security vulnerabilities.
```
#ifdef Q_OS_HAIKU
# include <sys/sockio.h>
# define IFF_RUNNING 0x0001
#endif
```
Solution: Use the `strcmp` function to compare the two strings for equality:
```
#ifdef Q_OS_HAIKU
# include <sys/sockio.h>
# define IFF_RUNNING 0x0001
#endif
static inline bool mystring_eq(const char *a, const char *b) {
  return strcmp(a, b) == 0;
}
```
2. Line 255: CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
The code creates a new `QNetworkInterfacePrivate` object without checking if the object was created successfully. If the object creation fails, the code will continue to operate with an invalid pointer, which can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
```
QNetworkInterfacePrivate *iface = new QNetworkInterfacePrivate;
if (!iface) {
    // error: could not create QNetworkInterfacePrivate object
    return result;
}
```
Solution: Check if the object was created successfully before continuing:
```
QNetworkInterfacePrivate *iface = new QNetworkInterfacePrivate;
if (!iface) {
    // error: could not create QNetworkInterfacePrivate object
    return result;
}

// continue with the rest of the code
```
