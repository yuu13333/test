Here is a summary of the security defects found in the provided code:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
   - Line 145: The future list is added to the status dialog without checking if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the operations. An attacker could exploit this to perform unauthorized actions.

2. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
   - Line 81: The future list is created without proper resource management. The futures should be explicitly canceled and deleted to avoid memory leaks.

3. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
   - Line 114: The check for empty simulatorInfoList is done after the expensive operation of retrieving the selected simulators. This can lead to unnecessary work.

4. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
   - Line 144: The future list is added to the status dialog without checking if the operation was successful. An attacker could exploit this to add malicious futures to the list.

5. CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
   - Line 227: The user input for the new device name is not properly neutralized and could potentially contain malicious characters.

6. CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
   - Line 332: The setText() method is used to set the data for the NameColumn instead of setData(). This can lead to unexpected behavior.

Here are the suggested solutions for the defects:

1. CWE-284: Add a check for user permissions before adding the future list to the status dialog.
2. CWE-664: Add proper resource management to the future list by explicitly canceling and deleting the futures when they are no longer needed.
3. CWE-691: Move the check for empty simulatorInfoList before the expensive operation of retrieving the selected simulators.
4. CWE-703: Check if the operation was successful before adding the future list to the status dialog.
5. CWE-707: Properly neutralize the user input for the new device name by using the appropriate Qt sanitization functions.
6. CWE-710: Use the setData() method to set the data for the NameColumn instead of setText().
