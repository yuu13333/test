**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
Line 407-453: The input read function `readData` does not properly handle errors during input device initialization, such as `errno == EINTR` or `errno == EAGAIN`, possibly leading to unexpected behavior or application crashes. By default, EAGAIN is returned by mtdev_get when the input buffer is full, and EINTR is returned when the system call is interrupted by a signal, both of which should be handled.

**Solution**:
```cpp
forever {
    do {
        events = mtdev_get(m_mtdev, m_fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer) / sizeof(::input_event));
        // keep trying mtdev_get if we get interrupted. note that we do not
        // (and should not) handle EAGAIN; EAGAIN means that reading would
        // block and we'll get back here later to try again anyway.
    } while (events == -1 && errno == EINTR);

    // 0 events is EOF, -1 means error, handle both in the same place
    if (events <= 0)
        goto err;
}
```

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
Line 267: In the `QEvdevTouchScreenHandler` constructor, the `m_typeB` member is set to `true` when `#if QT_CONFIG(mtdev)` is defined, which is a non-standard coding practice using a preprocessor macro.

**Solution**:
```cpp
#if QT_CONFIG(mtdev)
    m_typeB = true;
#else
    long absbits[NUM_LONGS(ABS_CNT)];
    if (ioctl(m_fd, EVIOCGBIT(EV_ABS, sizeof(absbits)), absbits) >= 0) {
        m_typeB = testBit(ABS_MT_SLOT, absbits);
        m_singleTouch = !testBit(ABS_MT_POSITION_X, absbits);
    }
#endif
```
