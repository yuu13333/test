**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

The main issue of this code is that it launches a thread for the server (line 60), but does not wait for it to finish before the application exits (lines 159-161).

This can cause the following issues:

1. The server thread may still be running when the application exits, which can lead to resource leaks or crashes.
2. The server thread may be interrupted before it has finished its work, which can lead to data loss or corruption.

To fix this issue, the application should wait for the server thread to finish before exiting. This can be done by calling the join() method on the server thread (line 160) before the application exits.
