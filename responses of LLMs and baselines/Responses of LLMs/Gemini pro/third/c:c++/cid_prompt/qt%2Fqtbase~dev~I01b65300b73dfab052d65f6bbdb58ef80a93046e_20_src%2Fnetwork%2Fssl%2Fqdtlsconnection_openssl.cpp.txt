The following security defects are detected in the provided code:

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
- Line 100: The code uses `std::memcpy` to copy 4 bytes into a `in_addr` which has a size of 8 bytes. This may cause undefined behavior or incorrect data being used in the application.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
- Line 149: The code uses `q_RAND_bytes` to generate a random key for the `CookieSecret` class. However, this function is not guaranteed to be cryptographically secure and may be predictable in certain cases.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
- Line 151: The code does not handle the case where `q_RAND_bytes` returns a non-positive value, which may indicate an error or unexpected condition.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
- Line 434: The code uses `hmac.addData` to add data to the HMAC object without checking if the data is properly formatted or valid. This may lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
- Line 110: The code uses a `default:` case without a `break` statement, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the application.
