1. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)
   - Line 153: The function `checkExecutable` does not close the file descriptor after checking if the executable exists. This can lead to resource leakage if the function is called multiple times in a loop.
   - Solution: Close the file descriptor after checking if the executable exists.

2. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)
   - Line 134: The function `checkExecutable` uses `qgetenv` to retrieve the value of the `DEFAULT_BROWSER` environment variable. However, `qgetenv` does not perform any input validation, which means that an attacker could set the `DEFAULT_BROWSER` environment variable to a malicious value and cause the program to launch a malicious application when `openUrl` is called.
   - Solution: Use a more secure function, such as `getenv`, to retrieve the value of the `DEFAULT_BROWSER` environment variable.

3. CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)
   - Line 273: The function `openUrl` checks if the URL scheme is `mailto` using the equality operator (`==`). However, the equality operator is not appropriate for comparing strings, as it will return true even if the strings are not equal in case.
   - Solution: Use the `QString::compare` function to compare the URL scheme to `mailto`.
