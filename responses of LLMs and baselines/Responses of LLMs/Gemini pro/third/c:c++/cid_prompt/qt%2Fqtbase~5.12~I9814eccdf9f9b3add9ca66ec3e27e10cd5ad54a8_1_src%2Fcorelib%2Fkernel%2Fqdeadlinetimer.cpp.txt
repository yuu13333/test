**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
* Line 42: The following code snippet does not perform proper access control checks. It allows any user to access the private members of the QDeadlineTimer class, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
```c++
QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE
Q_DECL_CONST_FUNCTION static inline QPair<qint64, qint64> toSecsAndNSecs(qint64 nsecs)
{
    qint64 secs = nsecs / (1000*1000*1000);
    if (nsecs < 0)
        --secs;
    nsecs -= secs * 1000*1000*1000;
    return qMakePair(secs, nsecs);
}
``` 
* **Solution**: Add proper access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can access the private members of the QDeadlineTimer class.
