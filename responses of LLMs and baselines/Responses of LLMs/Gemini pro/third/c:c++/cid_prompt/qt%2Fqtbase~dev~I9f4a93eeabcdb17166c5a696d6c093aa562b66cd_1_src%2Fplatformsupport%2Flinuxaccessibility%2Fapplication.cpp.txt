* **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)** (line 193)
   - The code queues key events in a list (`keyEvents`) and then sends them after receiving a callback from the DBus message. However, the code does not handle the case where the callback is not received or takes too long. This could lead to events being lost or delayed indefinitely.
   
   - **Solution**: Add a timeout to the `dbusConnection.callWithCallback()` call and handle the case where the timeout is exceeded. For example:
   ```cpp
   // Set a timeout of 100 milliseconds
   int timeout = 100;

   // Call the DBus method with a callback and error handler
   bool sent = dbusConnection.callWithCallback(m, this, SLOT(notifyKeyboardListenerCallback(QDBusMessage)),
                                SLOT(notifyKeyboardListenerError(QDBusError,QDBusMessage)), timeout);

   // If the message was not sent, post the event immediately
   if (!sent) {
       QPair<QPointer<QObject>, QKeyEvent*> event = keyEvents.dequeue();
       if (event.first)
           QCoreApplication::postEvent(event.first.data(), event.second);
   }
   ```
