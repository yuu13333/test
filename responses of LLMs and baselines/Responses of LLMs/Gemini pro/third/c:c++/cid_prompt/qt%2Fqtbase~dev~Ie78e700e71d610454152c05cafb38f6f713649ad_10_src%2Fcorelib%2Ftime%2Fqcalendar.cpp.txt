**Defect Details**

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**

1. **Line Number: 198:** The function `backendFromEnum` returns `backend` as null when it has not been successfully instantiated.
2. **Line Number: 204:** The function `backendFromEnum` deletes `backend` when the initialization fails. However, `backend` may not have been allocated memory, leading to a use-after-free error.
3. **Line Number: 209:** The function `backendFromEnum` returns `nullptr` when it should return the `backend`.

**Remediation**

1. **Line Number: 198:** Check if `backend` is not `nullptr` before returning it.
2. **Line Number: 204:** Delete `backend` only if it was successfully instantiated.
3. **Line Number: 209:** Return the `backend` instead of `nullptr`.

**Revised Code**

```cpp
1. if (backend)
2.     return backend;
3. delete backend;
4. return nullptr;
```
