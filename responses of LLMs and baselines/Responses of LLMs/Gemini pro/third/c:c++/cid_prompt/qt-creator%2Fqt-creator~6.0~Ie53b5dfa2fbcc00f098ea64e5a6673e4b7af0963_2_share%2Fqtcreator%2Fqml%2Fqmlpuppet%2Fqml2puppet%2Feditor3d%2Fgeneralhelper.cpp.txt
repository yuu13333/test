1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
   - Line 311: The component property of a picked node is read without proper access control. An attacker could potentially access and modify the component property of any node in the scene.
   - **Solution**: Perform proper access control checks before accessing the component property of a picked node. For example, ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the component property or that the component property is only accessible to authorized users.

2. CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):
   - Line 289: The setGlobalPickingEnabled() function is called without checking if the global picking is already enabled. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the global picking is already enabled.
   - **Solution**: Implement proper checks to determine if the global picking is already enabled before calling the setGlobalPickingEnabled() function.

3. CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
   - Line 290: The pickAll() function is called without checking if the view is valid. This could lead to a runtime error if the view is not valid.
   - **Solution**: Implement proper checks to determine if the view is valid before calling the pickAll() function.

4. CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
   - Line 455: The if condition checks if a node is a parent of another node without accounting for the possibility of circular references. This could lead to an infinite loop if the nodes are part of a circular reference.
   - **Solution**: Modify the if condition to check for circular references before performing the parent check.

5. CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):
   - Line 419: The if condition checks if the QT_VERSION is greater than or equal to QT_VERSION_CHECK(6, 0, 0) without accounting for the possibility of the QT_VERSION being equal to QT_VERSION_CHECK(6, 0, 0). This could lead to incorrect behavior if the QT_VERSION is equal to QT_VERSION_CHECK(6, 0, 0).
   - **Solution**: Modify the if condition to check for equality with QT_VERSION_CHECK(6, 0, 0) as well.

6. CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):
   - Line 301: The isPickable() function checks if a node is visible without checking if the node is also enabled. This could lead to a security issue if an attacker is able to disable a node and then access it through picking.
   - **Solution**: Implement proper checks to determine if a node is both visible and enabled before allowing it to be picked.
