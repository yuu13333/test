CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
Line 77-78: The function 'createOidMap' creates a static OidNameMap called 'oidNameMap' at the global scope. This global map is then used by 'toObjectName' to retrieve object names from OIDs. However, since the map is static, it is initialized only once and persists throughout the program's lifetime. This means that if any modification is made to the map during that lifetime, it will affect all subsequent uses of the map, potentially leading to confusion and unintended behavior. To fix this issue, the map should be created on the stack or passed as an argument to 'toObjectName' instead of relying on a global static map.

CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):
Line 214-215: The code attempts to convert an unsigned integer 'node' into a character and store it in 'buffer'. However, the code uses a signed character buffer, and '*--pBuffer = quint8((node & 0x7f))' may result in undefined behavior if 'node' is greater than 127 (i.e., the maximum value that can be stored in a signed 8-bit character). To fix this issue, the code should use an unsigned character buffer ('unsigned char').

CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):
Line 151-152: The function 'write' takes a 'QDataStream' reference and writes the type of the Asn1Element to the stream. However, the function does not check if the stream is valid before writing to it. If the stream is invalid or not open for writing, writing to it will result in undefined behavior and potential crashes. To fix this issue, the function should add checks to ensure that the stream is valid and open for writing before attempting to write to it.

Line 273-274: The function 'toDateTime' uses 'QDateTime::fromString' to parse a string representation of a date and time from the 'mValue' member variable. However, the function does not handle the case where 'QDateTime::fromString' fails to parse the string successfully. If the parsing fails, 'result' will remain invalid, and the function will return it without indicating the failure. To fix this issue, the function should add checks to handle the case where 'QDateTime::fromString' fails and return an appropriate error or default value instead of an invalid 'QDateTime' object.

CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):
Line 356-357: The function 'toList' returns a list of 'QAsn1Element' objects without any documentation or comments explaining the purpose or behavior of the function. Lack of documentation and comments can make it difficult for other developers to understand the code and can lead to errors and misunderstandings. To fix this issue, the function should be documented with comments explaining its purpose and behavior.
