The following security defects are detected in the code:

**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
* **Description:** The code does not properly validate the input from the user before using it. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
* **Line Number:** 67
* **Solution:** The code should validate the input from the user before using it.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
* **Description:** The code does not properly handle the interaction between the different classes. This could lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior.
* **Line Number:** 107
* **Solution:** The code should properly handle the interaction between the different classes.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
* **Description:** The code does not properly release the resources that it acquires. This could lead to memory leaks or other resource leaks.
* **Line Number:** 116
* **Solution:** The code should properly release the resources that it acquires.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
* **Description:** The code does not properly calculate the value of the m_apiLevel variable. This could lead to incorrect behavior.
* **Line Number:** 147
* **Solution:** The code should properly calculate the value of the m_apiLevel variable.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
* **Description:** The code does not properly handle the flow of control. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Line Number:** 67
* **Solution:** The code should properly handle the flow of control.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
* **Description:** The code does not properly protect against malicious input. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
* **Line Number:** 67
* **Solution:** The code should properly protect against malicious input.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
* **Description:** The code does not properly compare the values of the m_apiLevel and other variables. This could lead to incorrect behavior.
* **Line Number:** 147
* **Solution:** The code should properly compare the values of the m_apiLevel and other variables.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
* **Description:** The code does not properly handle exceptional conditions. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
* **Line Number:** 67
* **Solution:** The code should properly handle exceptional conditions.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
* **Description:** The code does not properly neutralize the input from the user before using it. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
* **Line Number:** 67
* **Solution:** The code should properly neutralize the input from the user before using it.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
* **Description:** The code does not adhere to proper coding standards. This could make the code difficult to read and maintain.
* **Line Number:** 67
* **Solution:** The code should adhere to proper coding standards.
