**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**

**Line: 185**
In the `futexSemaphoreTryAcquire` function, the following lines of code perform incorrect calculations when the system has the ability to wake up a precise number of threads, has Linux's `FUTEX_WAKE_OP` functionality, and is 64-bit:

```cpp
if (n > 1 && sizeof(curValue) > sizeof(int)) {
    curValue = 1;
    ptr = futexHigh32(&u);
}
```

In this code, when `n` is greater than 1 and the system meets the specified conditions, it incorrectly sets `curValue` to 1 and updates `ptr` to point to the high 32 bits of `u`. This calculation is incorrect because it should set `curValue` to `n` instead of 1.

**Solution:**

The correct code should be:

```cpp
if (n > 1 && sizeof(curValue) > sizeof(int)) {
    curValue = n;
    ptr = futexHigh32(&u);
}
```

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**

**Line: 282**
In the `QSemaphore::release` function, when the `futexAvailable` condition is true, the following code contains a potential protection mechanism failure:

```cpp
if (prevValue & futexContendedBit) {
#ifdef FUTEX_OP
    // ...
#else
    // Unset the bit and wake everyone. There are two possibibilies
    // under which a thread can set the bit between the AND and the
    // futexWake:
    // 1) it did see the new counter value, but it wasn't enough for
    //    its acquisition anyway, so it has to wait;
    // 2) it did not see the new counter value, in which case its
    //    futexWait will fail.
    u.fetchAndAndRelease(futexContendedBit - 1);
    futexWakeAll(u);
#endif
}
```

In the `#else` branch, the code attempts to unset the `futexContendedBit` and wake up all waiting threads using `futexWakeAll(u)`. However, if another thread sets the `futexContendedBit` between the `fetchAndAndRelease` and `futexWakeAll` operations, the protection mechanism can fail, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

**Solution:**

To address this issue, consider using a lock to protect the modification of the `futexContendedBit`. Additionally, using `futexWakeOp` instead of `futexWakeAll` can provide more precise control over which threads are woken up, ensuring that only waiting threads are notified.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**

**Line: 332**
In the `#else` branch of the `QSemaphore::release` function, the following code contains an improper check or handling of exceptional conditions:

```cpp
// ...
// 2) it did not see the new counter value, in which case its
//    futexWait will fail.
// ...
```

The comment suggests that a thread may fail to enter the `futexWait` due to not seeing the new counter value. However, the code does not handle this exceptional condition and does not provide any mechanisms to recover from it.

**Solution:**

Consider adding proper handling of exceptional conditions, such as checking the return value of `futexWait` and taking appropriate actions in case of failure.
