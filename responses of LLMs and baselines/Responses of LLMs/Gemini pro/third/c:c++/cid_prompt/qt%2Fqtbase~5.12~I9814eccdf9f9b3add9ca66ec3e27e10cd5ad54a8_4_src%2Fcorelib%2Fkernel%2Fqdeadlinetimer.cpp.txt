CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure: Elementary controls are insufficient to ensure the service operates in a safe and reliable fashion.

**Details:**
The function "QDeadlineTimer::QDeadlineTimer" sets the QDeadlineTimer object to an expired state if the input parameter "msecs" is zero. However, this check is performed before obtaining the current time. If the operating system or hardware is slow, it is possible that the current time may be slightly in the past when this check is performed, causing the QDeadlineTimer object to be incorrectly marked as expired even though it may still have time remaining. This could lead to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on QDeadlineTimer objects for timing purposes.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, the function should be modified to obtain the current time before performing the check against "msecs". This ensures that the QDeadlineTimer object is only marked as expired if it is truly in the past.
