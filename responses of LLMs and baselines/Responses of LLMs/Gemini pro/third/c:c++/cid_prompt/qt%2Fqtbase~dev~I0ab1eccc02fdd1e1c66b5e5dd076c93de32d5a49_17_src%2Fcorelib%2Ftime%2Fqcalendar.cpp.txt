1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** No security defects are detected. The code does not contain any access control mechanisms, so this defect is not applicable.
2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):** No security defects are detected. The code does not define any interface between multiple entities, so this defect is not applicable.
3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):** No security defects are detected. The code does not allocate any memory, so this defect is not applicable.
4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):** No security defects are detected. The code does not perform any calculations, so this defect is not applicable.
5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):** No security defects are detected. The code does not contain any loops or conditional statements, so this defect is not applicable.
6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):** No security defects are detected.
7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):** No security defects are detected. The code does not make any comparisons, so this defect is not applicable.
8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):** No security defects are detected. The code does not handle any exceptional conditions, so this defect is not applicable.
9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):** No security defects are detected.
10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):** No security defects are detected. The code adheres to proper coding standards, so this defect is not applicable.
11. **CWE-721 (Insecure Comparison):** No security defects are detected. The code does not make any insecure comparisons, so this defect is not applicable.
12. **CWE-732 (Injection):** No security defects are detected. The code does not include any functionality that could allow for injection attacks, so this defect is not applicable.
13. **CWE-749 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials):** No security defects are detected. The code does not use any hard-coded credentials, so this defect is not applicable.
14. **CWE-774 (Insecure Cookie Management):** No security defects are detected. The code does not interact with cookies, so this defect is not applicable.
15. **CWE-787 (Uncontrolled Memory Allocation):** No security defects are detected. The code does not allocate any memory, so this defect is not applicable.
16. **CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Data):** No security defects are detected. The code does not use any hard-coded data, so this defect is not applicable.
17. **CWE-862 (Data Leakage):** No security defects are detected. The code does not handle any data that could be considered sensitive, so this defect is not applicable.
18. **CWE-894 (Improper Control of Generation of Code):** No security defects are detected. The code does not generate any code, so this defect is not applicable.
