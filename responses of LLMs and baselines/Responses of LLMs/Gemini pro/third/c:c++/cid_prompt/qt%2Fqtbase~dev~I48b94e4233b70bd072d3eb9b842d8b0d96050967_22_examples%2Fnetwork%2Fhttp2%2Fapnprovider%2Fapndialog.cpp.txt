**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

Line 94:
```
Q_ASSERT(provider.data());
```
The code asserts that `provider` is not null, but it doesn't check if `provider->data()` is null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if `provider` is null.

**Solution**:
Add a check for `provider->data()` before using it.

```
if (!provider.data()) {
    QMessageBox::critical(this, tr("APN provider"), tr("Invalid provider"));
    return;
}
```

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**

Line 207:
```
close();
```
The `close()` function is called without checking if the dialog has been accepted or rejected. This could lead to data loss if the user has made changes to the dialog.

**Solution**:
Add a check for the dialog's result before closing it.

```
if (result() == QDialog::Accepted) {
    close();
}
```
