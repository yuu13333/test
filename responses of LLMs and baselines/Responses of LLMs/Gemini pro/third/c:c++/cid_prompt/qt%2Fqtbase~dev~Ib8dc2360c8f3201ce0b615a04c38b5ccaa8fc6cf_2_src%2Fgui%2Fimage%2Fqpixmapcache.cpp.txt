CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)

Line 658:
```
QT_TRY {
    if (pm_cache.exists())
        pm_cache->clear();
} QT_CATCH(const std::bad_alloc &) {
    // if we ran out of memory during pm_cache(), it's no leak,
    // so just ignore it.
}
```
The `clear` function uses the `QT_TRY` and `QT_CATCH` macros to handle exceptions. However, the `std::bad_alloc` exception is caught and ignored, which could lead to resource exhaustion if the cache cannot be cleared due to memory allocation failure. 

A more robust approach would be to use the `std::nothrow` flag when calling `clear` on the `pm_cache` pointer to avoid memory allocation failure, or to handle the exception appropriately by logging it or notifying the user.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**

Line 671:
```
int QPixmapCache::totalUsed()
{
    return (pm_cache()->totalCost()+1023) / 1024;
}
```
The `totalUsed` function calculates the total memory used by the cache by adding `1023` to the `totalCost` and then dividing by `1024`. This calculation is prone to integer overflow, especially when dealing with large cache sizes.

A safer approach would be to use a wider integer type for the calculation, such as `qint64` or `size_t`, to avoid potential overflow. Alternatively, the `totalCost` could be divided by `1024` before adding `1023` to prevent the overflow.
