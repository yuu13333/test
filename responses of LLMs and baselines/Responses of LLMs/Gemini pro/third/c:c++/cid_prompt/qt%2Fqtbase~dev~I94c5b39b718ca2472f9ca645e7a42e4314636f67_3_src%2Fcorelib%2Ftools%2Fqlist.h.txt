**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
No such security defects are detected. The access control of the list is implemented correctly. The list can be accessed and modified by the class member functions properly.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**
No such security defects are detected. The list is correctly initialized and all operations on the list are performed within the class. There is no interaction with external entities that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
No such security defects are detected. The list properly manages the memory allocated for its elements and ensures proper cleanup when necessary. The list is destroyed correctly when it is no longer needed, ensuring that resources are released and not leaked.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**
No such security defects are detected. The list correctly calculates the size, capacity, and other properties of the list. There are no incorrect calculations that could lead to buffer overflows or other security vulnerabilities.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**
No such security defects are detected. The list follows a well-defined control flow and there are no uncontrolled jumps or branches that could allow an attacker to manipulate the program flow.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**
No such security defects are detected. The list does not rely on any specific protection mechanisms to ensure its security. Instead, it relies on proper input validation and memory management to prevent attacks.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**
No such security defects are detected. The list uses correct comparison operators when comparing two lists or elements within a list, ensuring that the results of comparisons are accurate and predictable.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
No such security defects are detected. The list handles exceptional conditions, such as memory allocation failures or invalid inputs, gracefully and appropriately. It does not rely on unchecked exceptions or error handling mechanisms that could allow an attacker to exploit the program.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**
No such security defects are detected. The list does not contain any user-supplied data that needs to be neutralized or sanitized. It operates on its own internal data and does not accept input from external sources.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**
No such security defects are detected. The list adheres to the coding standards and guidelines established by the Qt framework, ensuring consistency and maintainability.
