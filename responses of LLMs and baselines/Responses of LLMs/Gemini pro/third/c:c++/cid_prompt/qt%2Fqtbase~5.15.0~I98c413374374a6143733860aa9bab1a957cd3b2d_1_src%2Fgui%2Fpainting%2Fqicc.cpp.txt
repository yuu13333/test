CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):
Line 816: colorspaceDPtr->iccProfile = data;

This line assigns the ICC profile data to the iccProfile member of the QColorSpacePrivate object without taking ownership of the data. This can lead to the data being deallocated before the QColorSpace object is destroyed, resulting in use-after-free errors. To fix this, the QColorSpace object should take ownership of the ICC profile data and ensure that it is deallocated when the object is destroyed.

No other security defects are detected in the code.
