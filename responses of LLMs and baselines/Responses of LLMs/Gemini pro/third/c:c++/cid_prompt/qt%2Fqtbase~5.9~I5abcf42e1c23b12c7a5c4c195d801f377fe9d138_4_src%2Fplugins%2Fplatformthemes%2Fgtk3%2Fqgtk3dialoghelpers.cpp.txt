**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

>This defect occurs when code does not perform adequate checks for authorization or access control. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.

* **Line 163**: `onResponse` function is not checking the `response` parameter for proper authorization. This could lead to an attacker being able to trigger arbitrary code execution by sending a specially crafted response.
* **Solution**: Add proper authorization checks to the `onResponse` function to ensure that only authorized users can perform the requested action.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

>This defect occurs when resources are not properly managed and released, leading to memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or other issues.

* **Line 103**: `gtk_widget_destroy(gtkWidget)` is called without checking if the widget has already been destroyed. This could lead to a double-free vulnerability.
* **Solution**: Check if the widget has already been destroyed before calling `gtk_widget_destroy`.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**

>This defect occurs when code does not properly handle exceptional conditions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

* **Line 101**: `gtk_clipboard_store` is called without checking if the clipboard is available. This could lead to a crash if the clipboard is not available.
* **Solution**: Check if the clipboard is available before calling `gtk_clipboard_store`.

**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**

>This defect occurs when protection mechanisms are not properly implemented or configured, allowing attackers to bypass security controls.

* **Line 360**: `_filters.value(filter)` is used to retrieve a GtkFileFilter, but it is not checked if the filter exists before using it. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if the filter is not found.
* **Solution**: Check if the filter exists before using it to retrieve a GtkFileFilter.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**

>This defect occurs when code uses incorrect or incomplete comparisons, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

* **Line 370**: `_filterNames.value(gtkFilter)` is used to retrieve a QString, but it is not checked if the filter exists before using it. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if the filter is not found.
* **Solution**: Check if the filter exists before using it to retrieve a QString.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**

>This defect occurs when code does not properly handle exceptional conditions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

* **Line 144**: `XSetTransientForHint` is called without checking if the `gdkWindow` is valid. This could lead to a crash if the `gdkWindow` is invalid.
* **Solution**: Check if the `gdkWindow` is valid before calling `XSetTransientForHint`.
