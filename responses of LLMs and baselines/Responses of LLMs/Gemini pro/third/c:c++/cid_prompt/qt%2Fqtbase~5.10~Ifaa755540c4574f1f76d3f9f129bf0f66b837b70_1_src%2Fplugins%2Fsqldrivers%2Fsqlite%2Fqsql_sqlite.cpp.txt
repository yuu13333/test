**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**
Line 344: The calculation of result set size is incorrect and always returns -1. A correct implementation should count the number of rows in the result set.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):**
Line 289 and Line 333: The code assumes that the result set is empty without checking the actual result of sqlite3_column_type. If the result set is not empty, the code may attempt to access invalid memory and crash.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):**
Line 407: The comparison of sqlite3_prepare16_v2() result to SQLITE_OK should also check for SQLITE_DONE to handle the case where the query is empty.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):**
Line 471: The code doesn't handle the case where the count of bind parameters doesn't match the count of values in the list, potentially leading to undefined behavior.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):**
Line 537 and Line 540: The code doesn't properly check the result of sqlite3_bind_*() calls, which can fail if the data type of the value doesn't match the expected type for the parameter.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):**
The code doesn't follow coding standards, such as using inconsistent naming conventions and missing braces in some places.
