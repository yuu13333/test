1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**

   This defect occurs when there is a lack of proper access control mechanisms in place, allowing unauthorized users to access or modify data or resources they should not have access to.

   **Line Number:** Not applicable in this case.

   **Solution:** Implement proper access control mechanisms, such as authentication and authorization, to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data or resources.

2. **CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities)**

   This defect occurs when there is improper interaction between multiple entities, such as components, modules, or processes, leading to unexpected or incorrect behavior.

   **Line Number:** Not applicable in this case.

   **Solution:** Ensure that there is proper communication and coordination between different entities to prevent unexpected interactions and ensure correct behavior.

3. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

   This defect occurs when a resource is not properly controlled throughout its lifetime, leading to potential resource leaks or other issues.

   **Line Number:** Not applicable in this case.

   **Solution:** Implement proper resource management mechanisms to ensure that resources are allocated and released appropriately, preventing resource leaks and other issues.

4. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**

   This defect occurs when a calculation is performed incorrectly, leading to inaccurate or unexpected results.

   **Line Number:** Not applicable in this case.

   **Solution:** Review and verify all calculations to ensure that they are performed correctly and produce accurate results.

5. **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management)**

   This defect occurs when there is insufficient control flow management, leading to potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

   **Line Number:** Not applicable in this case.

   **Solution:** Implement proper control flow management mechanisms to ensure that the program flow is controlled and predictable, preventing vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

6. **CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)**

   This defect occurs when a protection mechanism fails to prevent unauthorized access or modification of data or resources.

   **Line Number:** Not applicable in this case.

   **Solution:** Review and strengthen protection mechanisms to ensure that they are effective in preventing unauthorized access or modification of data or resources.

7. **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**

   This defect occurs when an incorrect comparison is made, leading to unexpected or incorrect behavior.

   **Line Number:** Not applicable in this case.

   **Solution:** Review and verify all comparisons to ensure that they are performed correctly and produce the intended results.

8. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**

   This defect occurs when exceptional conditions are not properly checked or handled, leading to unexpected or incorrect behavior.

   **Line Number:** Not applicable in this case.

   **Solution:** Implement proper error handling mechanisms to ensure that exceptional conditions are handled gracefully and do not lead to unexpected or incorrect behavior.

9. **CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization)**

   This defect occurs when user-supplied data is not properly neutralized before being used, leading to potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

   **Line Number:** Not applicable in this case.

   **Solution:** Implement proper data validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure that user-supplied data is safe to use and does not pose any security risks.

10. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

   This defect occurs when coding standards are not properly followed, leading to potential vulnerabilities or maintainability issues.

   **Line Number:** Not applicable in this case.

   **Solution:** Adhere to established coding standards and guidelines to ensure that the code is secure, maintainable, and readable.

**Conclusion:** No security defects are detected in the provided code.
