There are three CWE defects found in this code:
1. Line 824-832: CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime, as you can observe, the code is using the `this` pointer inside a lambda function, which is a dangling pointer and will cause undefined behavior. The correct way to do this is using a lambda capture, like `[this]`, which will capture the `this` pointer and make it available to the lambda function.
2. Line 924-938: CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime, same issue as in defect 1.
3. Line 984: CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime, again, the code is using a dangling pointer to access members of the `owner` class, which will cause undefined behavior. The correct way to do this is to use a lambda capture, like `[this]`, which will capture the `this` pointer and make it available to the lambda function.

The possible solutions are:
1. For defect 1, replace the lambda function with the following:
```cpp
[this] (void) { (owner()->*Signal)(); }
```
2. For defect 2, replace the lambda function with the following:
```cpp
[this] { #if defined(__cpp_lib_is_invocable) && (__cpp_lib_is_invocable >= 201703L) static_assert(std::is_invocable_v<Functor>, "Functor callback must be callable without any parameters"); return QPropertyChangeHandler<Functor>(*this, f); }
```
3. For defect 3, replace the line with the following:
```cpp
qGetBindingStorage(owner())->maybeUpdateBindingAndRegister(this);
```
