**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):**

Lines 297-310, 312-317: The UUID class does not define a destructor, which can lead to resource leaks if the UUID is not properly cleaned up.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**

Line 55: The _q_toHex() function converts an integral value into hex values without performing bounds checking. If the value is too large, the buffer may be overrun.

Line 67: The _q_fromHex() function converts a hex string into an integral value without performing bounds checking. If the string is too long or contains invalid characters, the function may return an incorrect result or crash.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):**

Line 75: The _q_fromHex() function compares the character '0' to an integer, which is an incorrect comparison. It should compare the character to '0' as a character.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):**

Line 75: The _q_fromHex() function does not handle the case where the character is not a valid hex digit. This can lead to an incorrect result or a crash.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):**

Lines 55, 67: The _q_toHex() and _q_fromHex() functions do not properly neutralize the input data before using it. This can allow malicious users to inject arbitrary code or data into the application.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):**

Lines 55, 67: The _q_toHex() and _q_fromHex() functions use C-style casts, which can lead to undefined behavior and security vulnerabilities.

**No security defects are detected in the code:**
