Here are the security defects found in the code:

1. **CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation)**: Line 131: The `bufferSize` function incorrectly calculates the size of the buffer. If the number of elements, `N`, exceeds some value, the calculation will result in an incorrect size. This may lead to memory corruption or other undefined behavior when accessing the buffer.

Solution: Use a correct formula or library to calculate the buffer size.

2. **CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**: Line 192: The `appendTo` function may be inefficient for large sets. Appending elements to a vector one by one can lead to excessive copying and reallocation.

Solution: Use a more efficient method to transfer the elements from the set into the vector, such as using the `reserve` function to preallocate the vector's capacity and then using the `insert` method to add elements in bulk.
