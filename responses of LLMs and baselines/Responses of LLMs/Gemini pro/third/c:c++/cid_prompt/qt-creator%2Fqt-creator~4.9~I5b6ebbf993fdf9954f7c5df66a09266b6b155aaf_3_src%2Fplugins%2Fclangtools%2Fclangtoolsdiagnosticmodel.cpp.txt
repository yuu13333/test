**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**

- **Location:** Line 153, 185, 191

- **Description:** The code does not properly clean up resources, specifically the `QFileSystemWatcher` instances created in `connectFileWatcher()` and `addWatchedPath()`. This can lead to resource leaks and potential crashes.

- **Solution:** Add a `disconnectFileWatcher()` method to clean up the `QFileSystemWatcher` instances when they are no longer needed, for example, in the `clear()` method.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**

- **Location:** Line 450

- **Description:** The code compares the `status` variable to the value `Scheduled` using the equality operator (`==`), but the `FixitStatus` enum has a `Scheduled` value.

- **Solution:** Change the comparison to `if (status == FixitStatus::Scheduled)`.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**

- **Location:** Line 461, 469, 482

- **Description:** The code does not handle potential errors when setting fix-it status or applying fix-it operations. This can lead to unexpected behavior or failures.

- **Solution:** Handle potential errors or exceptions and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards)**

- **Location:** Throughout the code

- **Description:** The code does not follow consistent coding standards, such as using braces for single-line if statements and avoiding unnecessary parentheses.

- **Solution:** Enforce coding standards using a linter or IDE plugin.
