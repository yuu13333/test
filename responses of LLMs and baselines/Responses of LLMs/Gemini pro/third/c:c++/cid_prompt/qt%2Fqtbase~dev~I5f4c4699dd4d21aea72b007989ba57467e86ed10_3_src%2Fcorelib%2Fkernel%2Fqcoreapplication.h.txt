The following security defects are detected in the code:

1. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - Line 203: The `sendEvent()` function does not check if the `event` object is `nullptr` before accessing its members. This could lead to a crash if the `event` object is `nullptr`.
   - **Solution**: Add a check for `nullptr` before accessing the `event` object's members.

2. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - Line 206: The `sendSpontaneousEvent()` function does not check if the `event` object is `nullptr` before accessing its members. This could lead to a crash if the `event` object is `nullptr`.
   - **Solution**: Add a check for `nullptr` before accessing the `event` object's members.

3. **CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**
   - Line 206: The `sendSpontaneousEvent()` function does not handle the case where the `self` object is `nullptr`. This could lead to a crash if the `self` object is `nullptr`.
   - **Solution**: Add a check for `nullptr` before accessing the `self` object's members.

4. **CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime)**
   - Line 210: The `translate()` function in the `QT_NO_TRANSLATION` macro does not check if the `sourceText` object is `nullptr` before accessing its members. This could lead to a crash if the `sourceText` object is `nullptr`.
   - **Solution**: Add a check for `nullptr` before accessing the `sourceText` object's members.
