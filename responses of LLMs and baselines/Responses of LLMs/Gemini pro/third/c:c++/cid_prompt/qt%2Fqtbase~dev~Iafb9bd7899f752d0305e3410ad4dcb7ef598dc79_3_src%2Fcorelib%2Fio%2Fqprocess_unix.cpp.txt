**CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure):**

* **Description:** A security function or mechanism either does not operate as intended or does not operate at all. Attacks take advantage of system flaws or weaknesses that cause security functions to fail.
* **Line Number:** Not applicable in the code snippet provided.
* **Solution:** Implement and maintain proper security mechanisms to prevent attacks.

**CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation):**

* **Description:** An incorrect calculation or algorithmic error occurs. The results can lead to predictable and exploitable behaviors.
* **Line Number:** Not applicable in the code snippet provided.
* **Solution:** Implement and maintain correct algorithms and calculations.

**CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison):**

* **Description:** A security-relevant comparison, often used within access control or authentication mechanisms, does not operate as intended. Attacks manipulate input to cause incorrect comparisons.
* **Line Number:** Not applicable in the code snippet provided.
* **Solution:** Implement and maintain correct comparisons.

**CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime):**

* **Description:** Resources are not properly freed or released when they are no longer needed. Attacks either deny service or execute arbitrary code.
* **Line Number:** 218, 224
* **Solution:** Properly free or release resources when they are no longer needed.

**CWE-710 (Improper Adherence to Coding Standards):**

* **Description:** Coding standards are a set of best practices that are designed to improve the security of software. Failure to follow these standards can lead to vulnerabilities.
* **Line Number:** Not applicable in the code snippet provided.
* **Solution:** Follow coding standards and best practices.

**CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):**

* **Description:** Control flow within a program may not be properly managed. Attacks take advantage of anomalies in control flow.
* **Line Number:** Not applicable in the code snippet provided.
* **Solution:** Implement and maintain proper control flow management.

**CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):**

* **Description:** Exceptional conditions are not properly checked or handled. Attacks can either cause exceptions to occur or take advantage of exceptions that do occur.
* **Line Number:** Not applicable in the code snippet provided.
* **Solution:** Properly check and handle exceptional conditions.

**CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization):**

* **Description:** Data that should be neutralized (e.g., before use in a command) is not properly cleaned or filtered. Attacks can inject malicious commands or data.
* **Line Number:** Not applicable in the code snippet provided.
* **Solution:** Properly neutralize data before use.

**CWE-435 (Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities):**

* **Description:** An application includes components or modules with cross-cutting concerns. Attacks exploit relationships and interactions between these entities.
* **Line Number:** Not applicable in the code snippet provided.
* **Solution:** Design and implement applications with minimal cross-cutting concerns.

**CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):**

* **Description:** Access to a resource is not properly controlled. Attacks exploit the lack of proper control to access a resource without authorization.
* **Line Number:** Not applicable in the code snippet provided.
* **Solution:** Implement and maintain proper access controls.
