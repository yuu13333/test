**Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime (CWE-284)**
sslLibraryVersionString method in QSecureTransportContext private does not properly release memory after it is done with its context.

**CWE-435: Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities**
The function qt_createSecureTransportContext does not have a mutex or lock to ensure only one thread is using context at a time.

**CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**
- The context is created in the qt_createSecureTransportContext function, but is never freed.
- The context in the QSslSocketPrivate::initSslContext function may not be properly destroyed. 
- The context in the QSslSocketBackendPrivate::destroySslContext function is not properly freed.
- The context in the QSslSocketBackendPrivate::startHandshake function may not be properly destroyed.

**CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation**
- SSLGetNegotiatedCipher in QSslSocketBackendPrivate::sessionCipher does not properly check if the context is valid before attempting to get cipher information.
- SSLGetNegotiatedProtocolVersion in QSslSocketBackendPrivate::sessionProtocol does not properly check if the context is valid before attempting to get protocol version information.

**CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management**
- The QSslSocketBackendPrivate::transmit method does not handle the following two cases properly:
    - SSLWrite may return errSSLWouldBlock and a call to try again is never attempted.
    - SSLRead may return errSSLWouldBlock and a proper call to try again is never attempted.

**CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure**
- SSLRead in the QSslSocketPrivate::sslLibraryVersionNumber method does not verify that dataLength is valid before attempting to read the given number of bytes.

**CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison**
- QSslSocketBackendPrivate::QSslCipher_from_SSLCipherSuite returns NULL when the cipher is unknown, but ciphers are not checked for equality with NULL.

**CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**
- If an error occurs, QSslSocketPrivate::setErrorAndEmit will emit the error but the socket will not be disconnected.

**CWE-707: Improper Neutralization**
- The array in QSslSocketBackendPrivate::transmit is cleared, but not the variable assigned to the array.

**CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards**
- The code lacks appropriate unit testing.
