The following security defects are detected in the code:

1. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):
   - Line 126: The code reads the entire file into a local buffer without checking for the file size. This can lead to excessive memory usage and potential denial of service attacks.
   - Line 157: In the loop to read the mipmap levels, there is no check for end-of-file before trying to read the image size. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read.

2. CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions):
   - Line 159: In the loop to read the mipmap levels, there is no check for end-of-file before trying to read the image size. If the file is truncated, this can lead to an out-of-bounds read.
   - Line 230: In the loop to decode the key-value pairs, there is no check for end-of-file before trying to read the key and value byte size. If the file is truncated, this can lead to an out-of-bounds read.
