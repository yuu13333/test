**CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**

- **Line number**: 70
- **Description**: The variable `oldGroupMode` is declared and initialized, but never used. This can lead to a dangling pointer, which can be a security risk if it is later accessed.
- **Solution**: Remove the declaration and initialization of `oldGroupMode`.

**CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**

- **Line number**: 83
- **Description**: The check for `m_ui.filterLineEdit->isValid()` is performed before the assignment of `m_ui.filterLineEdit->text()` to `result.gtestFilter`. If the edit is invalid, the old value of `m_currentGTestFilter` is used instead. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the filter is invalid.
- **Solution**: Move the check for `m_ui.filterLineEdit->isValid()` after the assignment of `m_ui.filterLineEdit->text()` to `result.gtestFilter`.
