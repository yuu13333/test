***Security defects are detected in the code***:

**Line 97:**
The code sends a UDP datagram to the broadcast address using the ```writeDatagram()``` function. However, it does not check the return value of ```writeDatagram()``` to ensure that the datagram was successfully sent. If the datagram is not sent, the program will continue to operate as if it was sent, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

**Solution:**
```
int numBytes = udpSocket->writeDatagram(datagram, QHostAddress::Broadcast, 45454);
if (numBytes == -1) {
     // Handle error
}
```

**Line 98:**
The variable ```messageNo``` is incremented without checking if the datagram was successfully sent. If the datagram was not sent, the program will continue to increment ```messageNo```, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

**Solution:**
Move the incrementation of ```messageNo``` inside the if block that checks the return value of ```writeDatagram()```.

```
if (numBytes != -1) {
     ++messageNo;
}
```
