**Line 261:** The SDK tool `AndroidManager::minimumSDK` is being called without specifying the target's kit for which the minimum SDK version should be retrieved. This could lead to incorrect results if the target's kit is not the same as the default kit. To fix this, the target's kit should be explicitly specified as an argument to `AndroidManager::minimumSDK`.

**Suggested Code Change:**

```cpp
int minTargetApi = AndroidManager::minimumSDK(m_rc->target(), m_rc->kit());
```
