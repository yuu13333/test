118: BindingLoop
Binding loop error. This occurs when a property references to itself or other properties that reference to it, resulting in a circular reference. The code does not have this error.

119: EvaluationError
Evaluation error. This occurs when evaluating the expression of a property binding using QPropertyChangeHandler, resulting in an exception. The code does not have this error.

120: UnknownError
Unknown error. This occurs when an error occurs during property binding but the exact cause is not known. The code does not have this error.

136: QSharedDataPointer<QPropertyBindingErrorPrivate> d;
A missing initialization for d presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized QPropertyBindingErrorPrivate object, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

287: setSource(property.bindingData());
The property.bindingData() member function may return a null QPropertyBindingData reference if the property has no binding. This can lead to undefined behavior when accessing the QPropertyBindingData object. The code does not have this error.

324: setSource(property);
The property.bindingData() member function may return a null QPropertyBindingData reference if the property has no binding. This can lead to undefined behavior when accessing the QPropertyBindingData object. The code does not have this error.

455: void notify()
{
456         d.notifyObservers(this);
457 }
A missing initialization for d means that notifyObservers is called on an uninitialized QPropertyBindingData object, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

611: BindingSetter setBinding;
A missing initialization for setBinding presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized BindingSetter, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

612: MakeBinding makeBinding;
A missing initialization for makeBinding presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized MakeBinding, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

613: SetObserver setObserver;
A missing initialization for setObserver presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized SetObserver, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

679: void observe(QPropertyObserver *observer)
{
680         iface->setObserver(data, observer);
681 }
A missing initialization for iface presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized SetObserver, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

698: QUntypedPropertyBinding binding() const
{
700         if (!iface->getBinding)
701             return QUntypedPropertyBinding();
702         return iface->getBinding(data);
703 }
A missing initialization for iface presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized SetObserver, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

706: bool setBinding(const QUntypedPropertyBinding &binding)
{
707         if (!iface->setBinding)
708             return false;
709         iface->setBinding(data, binding);
710         return true;
711 }
A missing initialization for iface presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized SetObserver, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

770: QtPrivate::QPropertyBindingData *bindingData(QUntypedPropertyData *data, bool create);
A missing initialization for bindingData presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized QPropertyBindingData object, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

882: QtPrivate::QPropertyBindingData *bd = qGetBindingStorage(owner())->bindingData(this, true);
A missing initialization for bindingData presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized QPropertyBindingData object, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

913: return static_cast<QPropertyBinding<T> &&>(QUntypedPropertyBinding(bd ? bd->binding() : nullptr));
A missing initialization for bindingData presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized QPropertyBindingData object, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

943: return *storage->bindingData(const_cast<ThisType *>(this), true);
A missing initialization for bindingData presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized QPropertyBindingData object, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.

1031: return *storage->bindingData(const_cast<QObjectComputedProperty *>(this), true);
A missing initialization for bindingData presents the risk of accessing an uninitialized QPropertyBindingData object, leading to undefined behavior. The code does not have this error.
