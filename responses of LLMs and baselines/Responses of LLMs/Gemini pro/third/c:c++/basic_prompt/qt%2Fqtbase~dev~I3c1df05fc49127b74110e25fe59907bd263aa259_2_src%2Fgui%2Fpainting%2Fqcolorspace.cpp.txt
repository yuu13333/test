**Line 543**: The function `primaries` is called on a null pointer, which results in a segmentation fault. To fix this issue, add a check to ensure that `d_ptr` is a valid pointer before referencing it.

```c++
QColorSpace::Primaries QColorSpace::primaries() const noexcept
{
    if (Q_UNLIKELY(!d_ptr))
        return QColorSpace::Primaries::Custom;
    return d_ptr->primaries;
}
```
