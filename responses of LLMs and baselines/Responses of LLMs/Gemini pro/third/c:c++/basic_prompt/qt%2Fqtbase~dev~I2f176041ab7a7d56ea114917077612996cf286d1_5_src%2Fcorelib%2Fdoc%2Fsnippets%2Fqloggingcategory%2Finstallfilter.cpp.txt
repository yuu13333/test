There is a hard-coded secret in this code. Specifically, the constant QtDebugMsg is used on line 55. This constant is not defined in the code, and it is not clear what value it represents. This constant could potentially be used to log sensitive information, so it should be removed from the code.
Solution: Remove the constant QtDebugMsg from the code.
