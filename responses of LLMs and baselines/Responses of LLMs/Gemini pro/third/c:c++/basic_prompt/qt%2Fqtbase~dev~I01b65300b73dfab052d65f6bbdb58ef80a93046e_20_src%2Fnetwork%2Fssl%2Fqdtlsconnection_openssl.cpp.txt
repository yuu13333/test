Line 429:

The code uses `qt_get_cookie_material_for_connection` to obtain the peer data for cookie generation. However, this function is not defined in the provided code, and its implementation is not shown either. Without its implementation, it's challenging to assess the security of this line of code. It's recommended to provide the implementation of `qt_get_cookie_material_for_connection` or explain how it securely obtains the peer data.
