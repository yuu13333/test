**Line 64:** The 'addSecsAndNSecs' function does not properly handle negative nanoseconds. It assumes that 'addNSecs' will always be called with a positive value, leading to incorrect results when 'add_overflow' is called with negative values.

**Line 110:** The 'adjust' function does not properly handle the case when 'secs' overflows and 'addSecs' is called with a negative value. This can lead to incorrect results when 'add_overflow' is called with large negative values.

**Solution:**

**Line 64:** Check for negative values of nanoseconds before adding them in 'addSecsAndNSecs' and adjust 'secs' accordingly.
**Line 110:** Check for overflow in 'adjust' and handle negative values of 'secs' correctly.
