The code in question reports the following security defects:
- **REPORT_MISSING_SUPPORT(message)** method doesn't provide any information about supported features, and thus should be replaced with an empty implementation.
- **X509Certificate::numberOfExtensions()** doesn't check if the certificate is a null certificate.
- **X509Certificate::oidForExtension()**: if the certificate is a null certificate, this method doesn't check whether an index is greater than the number of extensions and returns OID instead of an empty string.
- **X509Certificate::nameForExtension()**: if the certificate is a null certificate, this method doesn't check whether an index is greater than the number of extensions and returns OID instead of an empty string.
- **X509Certificate::valueForExtension()**: if the certificate is a null certificate, this method doesn't check whether an index is greater than the number of extensions and doesn't return an empty QVariant.
- **X509Certificate::isExtensionCritical()**: if the certificate is a null certificate, this method doesn't check whether an index is greater than the number of extensions and returns false instead of true.
- **X509Certificate::isExtensionSupported()**: if the certificate is a null certificate, this method doesn't check whether an index is greater than the number of extensions and returns false instead of true.
- **X509Certificate::toDer()** doesn't check if the certificate is a null certificate.
- **init()** doesn't check if d is a null pointer.
- **DtlsCryptograph::verifyClient()** doesn't consult the cookie generation parameters to verify a ClientHello message and doesn't send a HelloVerifyRequest message if a valid cookie was not found.
- **DtlsCryptograph::sendShutdownAlert()** doesn't check if the underlying TLS library provides the necessary functionality to send a ShutdownAlert message.
- **DtlsCryptograph::writeDatagramEncrypted()** doesn't check if the DtlsCryptograph is in the QDtls::HandshakeState::HandshakeComplete state.
- **DtlsCryptograph::decryptDatagram()** doesn't check if the DtlsCryptograph is in the QDtls::HandshakeState::HandshakeComplete state.
