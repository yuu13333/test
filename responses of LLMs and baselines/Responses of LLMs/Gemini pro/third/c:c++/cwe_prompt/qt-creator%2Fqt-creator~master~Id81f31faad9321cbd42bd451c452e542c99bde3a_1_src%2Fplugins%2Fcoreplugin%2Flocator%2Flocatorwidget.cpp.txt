**CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**

Line(s): 208, 209

The `displayIcon` field is not initialized and may contain garbage data, which could lead to a buffer overflow if it is not properly checked before being used.

**Solution:**

Initialize the `displayIcon` field to a null icon.

```cpp
class LocatorFilterEntry {
  ...
  QIcon displayIcon; // Initialize to null icon to avoid garbage data
  ...
};
```

**CWE-191 (Integer Underflow or Wraparound)**

Line(s): 471

The `index` variable is decremented to a negative value, which could lead to an integer underflow.

**Solution:**

Use a modulo operation to wrap around the index.

```cpp
void CompletionList::previous() {
  int index = currentIndex().row();
  index = (index - 1 + model()->rowCount(QModelIndex())) % model()->rowCount(QModelIndex());
  setCurrentIndex(model()->index(index, 0));
}
```
