**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**

Line 288:
```
noSplashscreenLayout->addStretch();
```
Line 294:
```
noSplashscreenLayout->setAlignment(m_convertSplashscreen, Qt::AlignHCenter);
```

The code is vulnerable to improper input validation because it does not validate the input of the `m_convertSplashscreen` tool button, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Solution:**

1. Validate the input of the `m_convertSplashscreen` tool button using proper input validation techniques, such as input sanitization and input validation functions.
2. Restrict the input to only allowed values.
