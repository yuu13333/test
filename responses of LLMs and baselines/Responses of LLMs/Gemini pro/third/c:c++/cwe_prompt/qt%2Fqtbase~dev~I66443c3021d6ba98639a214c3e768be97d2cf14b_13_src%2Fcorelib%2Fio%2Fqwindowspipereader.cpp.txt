The following security defects were identified:

**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**

* Line 51: The value of `minReadBufferSize` is hardcoded to 4096, which may be too large or too small for some applications. This could lead to buffer overflows or buffer underflows, which could result in security vulnerabilities.
* Line 251: The value of `bytesToRead` is not validated before being used in the `ReadFile()` function. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the value of `bytesToRead` is too large.
