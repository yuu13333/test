The following security defects are detected in the code:

**CWE-119:** Improper Restriction of Operations within Bounds of a Buffer

Line 669: `identifierKind(m_originalCursor, Recursion::FirstPass);`

This line of code attempts to access the `m_originalCursor` member without first checking if it is valid. If `m_originalCursor` is invalid, this could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Solution:**

To fix this defect, you should add a check to ensure that `m_originalCursor` is valid before accessing it. For example:

```cpp
if (m_originalCursor.isValid()) {
  identifierKind(m_originalCursor, Recursion::FirstPass);
}
```

**CWE-119:** Improper Restriction of Operations within Bounds of a Buffer

Line 676: `m_types.mainHighlightingType = literalKind(m_originalCursor);`

This line of code attempts to access the `m_originalCursor` member without first checking if it is valid. If `m_originalCursor` is invalid, this could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Solution:**

To fix this defect, you should add a check to ensure that `m_originalCursor` is valid before accessing it. For example:

```cpp
if (m_originalCursor.isValid()) {
  m_types.mainHighlightingType = literalKind(m_originalCursor);
}
```
