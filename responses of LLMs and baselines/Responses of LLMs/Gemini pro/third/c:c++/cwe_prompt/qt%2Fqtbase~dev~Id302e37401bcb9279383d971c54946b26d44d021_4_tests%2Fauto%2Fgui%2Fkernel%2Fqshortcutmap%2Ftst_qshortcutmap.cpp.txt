**CWE-399: Resource Exhaustion (Resource Depletion)**
**Line Number:** 93
**Description:** In Qt versions prior to Qt 6.2, the destruction of a QShortcut object would not remove any associated shortcuts from the QShortcutMap. This could lead to a memory leak if the QShortcut object was created with a large number of shortcuts.
**Solution:** Upgrade to Qt 6.2 or later.

**CWE-676: Improper Privilege Management (Privilege Escalation)**
**Line Number:** 90
**Description:** The QShortcutMap::addShortcut() function allows users to create shortcuts for any window, regardless of whether the user has permission to do so. This could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions by creating shortcuts that trigger privileged operations.
**Solution:** Ensure that the user has the appropriate permissions before allowing them to create shortcuts.

**CWE-305: Insufficient Control of Resource Consumption (Resource Leak)**
**Line Number:** 93
**Description:** The QShortcutMap::addShortcut() function does not remove any associated shortcuts from the QShortcutMap when the owner is deleted. This could lead to a memory leak if the owner is deleted without first removing the shortcut.
**Solution:** Set `badOwner` to `null` as in: `QGuiApplicationPrivate::instance()->shortcutMap.addShortcut(badOwner, QKeySequence(QKeySequence::StandardKey::Delete), Qt::ShortcutContext::WindowShortcut, simpleContextMatcher); badOwner = null`.

**No security defects are detected in the code.**
