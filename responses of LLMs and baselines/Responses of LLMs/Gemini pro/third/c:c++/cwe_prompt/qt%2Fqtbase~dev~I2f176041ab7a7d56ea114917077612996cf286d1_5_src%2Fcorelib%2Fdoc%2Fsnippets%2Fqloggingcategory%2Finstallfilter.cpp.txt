**CWE-363: Privilege Elevation**

CWE-363, also known as "Elevation of Privilege," occurs when a user or attacker with a lower level of access is able to gain higher-level privileges on a system. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in software or configurations, or by using malicious code to escalate privileges.

**Line Number:** 45-58

**Solution:**

In this specific case, the code installs a custom category filter, `myCategoryFilter`, to control the logging behavior for specific categories. This filter could potentially be used to escalate privileges by allowing an attacker to modify the logging behavior for sensitive categories, such as those related to authentication or system configuration.

To mitigate this risk, the code should restrict the category filter to only allow access to non-sensitive categories. Additionally, the code should validate the input to the category filter to ensure that it is not being used for malicious purposes.

The following code snippet provides an updated version of the `myCategoryFilter` function that restricts the categories that can be modified:

```cpp
void myCategoryFilter(QLoggingCategory *category)
{
    // Only allow filtering for the "driver.usb" category.
    if (qstrcmp(category->categoryName(), "driver.usb") == 0)
        category->setEnabled(QtDebugMsg, true);
}
```
