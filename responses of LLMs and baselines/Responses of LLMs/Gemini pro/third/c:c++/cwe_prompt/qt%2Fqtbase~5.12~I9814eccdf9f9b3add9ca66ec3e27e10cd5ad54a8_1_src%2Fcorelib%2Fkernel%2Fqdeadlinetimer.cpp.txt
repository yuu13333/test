The following security defects are found in the provided code:

1. CWE-488: Undefined Behavior for Unsigned Wrap (Line 51): `return qMakePair(secs, nsecs);`
   - The provided code lacks bounds checking, which makes the code vulnerable to undefined behavior. The code should add proper bounds checking to ensure that the return values are within the expected range.

2. CWE-488: Undefined Behavior for Unsigned Wrap (Line 320): `if (t2 > 1000*1000*1000)`
   - The provided code lacks bounds checking, which makes the code vulnerable to undefined behavior. The code should add proper bounds checking to ensure that the values are within the expected range.

3. CWE-488: Undefined Behavior for Unsigned Wrap (Line 568): `if (dt.t2 > 1000*1000*1000)`
   - The provided code lacks bounds checking, which makes the code vulnerable to undefined behavior. The code should add proper bounds checking to ensure that the values are within the expected range.

The following solutions address the detected security defects:

1. For CWE-488 in Line 51, add bounds checking to ensure that `secs` and `nsecs` are within the expected range before returning them.

```cpp
return qMakePair(secs < 0 ? secs - 1: secs, nsecs);
```

2. For CWE-488 in Line 320, add bounds checking to ensure that `t2` is within the expected range before proceeding.

```cpp
if (t2 > 1000*1000*1000) {
    t2 -= 1000*1000*1000;
    ++t1;
}
```

3. For CWE-488 in Line 568, add bounds checking to ensure that `dt.t2` is within the expected range before proceeding.

```cpp
if (dt.t2 > 1000*1000*1000) {
    dt.t2 -= 1000*1000*1000;
    ++dt.t1;
}
```
