**CWE-253: Information Exposure through Cleartext Transmission**
- Line 96 does not provide any encryption or confidentiality to the data being transmitted, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping or interception.

**CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code**
- The code does not validate the input received from external sources, making it susceptible to injection attacks. Attackers can inject malicious code into the application by sending crafted messages.

**CWE-200: Information Exposure: Sensitive Data Exposure**
- The code does not encrypt or protect sensitive information (such as passwords) before transmitting it over the network. An attacker could intercept and access this sensitive information.

**Suggested Fixes:**

- Line 96: Implement encryption and confidentiality measures to protect the transmitted data.
- Implement input validation on the received messages to prevent injection attacks.
- Encrypt or protect sensitive information before transmitting it over the network.
