**CWE-666: Improperly Releasing or Closing Resources or Information**
CWE-666 is caused by failing to release or close resources and information, which can lead to unauthorized access, denial of service, or resource depletion attacks.

Line 126 attempts to calculate the product of two variables, 'width' and 'depth,' and store the result in 'bytes_per_line.' If the product overflows, the function returns an invalid value. However, if an overflow occurs, it is possible for the function to return a value that is lower than the actual size of the buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Solution:**

```cpp
if (checkedMul(width, depth, &bytes_per_line) || add_overflow(bytes_per_line, qsizetype(31), &bytes_per_line)) {
    return invalid;
}
```

**CWE-680: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size**
CWE-680 is caused by incorrectly calculating the size of a buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

Line 137 attempts to calculate the product of 'height' and the size of a pointer, and store the result in 'dummy.' If the product overflows, the function returns an invalid value. However, if an overflow occurs, it is possible for the function to return a value that is lower than the actual size of the buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Solution:**

```cpp
if (checkedMul(height, qsizetype(sizeof(uchar *)), &dummy)) {
    return invalid;
}
```
