CWE-305: Insufficient Control of Memory Allocation	
Line 82: Q_OBJECT macro is used in the LauncherInterfacePrivate class. By default, the macro does not specify the parent class for the QObject and uses QObject as the parent class. It can lead to runtime errors and unexpected behavior when multiple instances of the class are created.
The solution is to specify the parent class explicitly in the Q_OBJECT macro.
```
class LauncherInterfacePrivate : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    LauncherInterfacePrivate(QObject *parent = nullptr)
        : QObject(parent)
    {
        //...
    }
    // ...
};
```
