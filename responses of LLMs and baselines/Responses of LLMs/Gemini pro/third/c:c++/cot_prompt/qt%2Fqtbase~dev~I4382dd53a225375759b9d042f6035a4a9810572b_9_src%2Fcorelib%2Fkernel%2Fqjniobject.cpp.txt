No security defects are detected in the code.\n\nThe code appears to be well-written and follows best practices for security. It does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities or security risks.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the security of any code depends on the context in which it is used. For example, if the code is used to process untrusted data, it is possible that a security vulnerability could be introduced.\n\nIt is always important to carefully review code and test it thoroughly before deploying it in a production environment.
