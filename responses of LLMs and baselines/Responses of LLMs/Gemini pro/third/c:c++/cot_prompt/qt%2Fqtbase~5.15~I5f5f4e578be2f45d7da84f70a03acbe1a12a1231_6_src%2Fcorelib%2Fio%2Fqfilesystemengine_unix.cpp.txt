**No security defects are detected in the code.**\n\nThis code operates on local files only, and does not accept any input from the network. It does not have any user-controlled inputs, so it is not vulnerable to buffer overflows, SQL injections, or other input validation attacks. The code also does not perform any privileged operations, so it is not vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks.
