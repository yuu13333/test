No security defects are detected in the code. The commit message states that the update "removes the rather egregious hack to handle the (pathological) case of a single thread talking to both ends of a QLocalSocket synchronously" and "improves performance (and in particular scalability)". This suggests that the previous implementation may have had security implications, but the changes in this commit are not security-related themselves.
